The murine 5\u2032 flanking region from \u22124480 to +92 was inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter gene and 5\u2032 deletions were generated using restriction enzyme sites or with specific oligonucleotide PCR primers. Construct names indicate the most 5\u2032 nucleotide of murine SerpinB2 5\u2032 flanking sequence. (B) RAW 264.7 macrophages were transiently transfected with the indicated murine SerpinB2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs and control plasmids. Cells were either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml LPS or 40 ng/ml PMA for 16 hrs. Shown is the relative luciferase reporter gene activity following treatment. The results represent the mean and SEM of four independent experiments. (C) DNA sequence conservation between the human and murine SerpinB2 5\u2032 flanking regions. Schematic representation of the human and murine SerpinB2 5\u2032 flanking regions with regions of nucleotide sequence identity indicated by the same colored boxes. Homologous regions are interrupted by repetitive sequence elements in both 5\u2032 flanking regions.
