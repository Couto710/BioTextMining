A growing number of studies have implicated necroptosis in a wide range of animal models of human disease, including brain, heart and retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury, acute pancreatitis, brain trauma, retinal detachment, and Huntington\u2019s disease [2], [3]. Importantly, several recent studies have linked necroptosis to models of inflammation including intestinal inflammation and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [4], [5], [6]. The discovery of a regulated form of necrotic death could uncover molecular targets amenable to pharmacological intervention for the treatment of various conditions.\nA complex consisting of two related Ser/Thr kinases, RIP1 and RIP3, plays a critical role in the initiation of necroptosis in multiple systems [7], [8], [9]. A recent genome wide siRNA screen for mediators of necroptosis induced by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk in mouse fibrosarcoma L929 cells, revealed a broad and diverse cellular network of 432 genes that may regulate this process [10]. These data provided important confirmation of the highly regulated nature of necroptosis and revealed the first insight into the full repertoire of mediators of this form of cell death. However, the specific signaling pathways activated during necroptosis and their connections to RIP1 and RIP3 remain poorly understood. Several recent studies [10], [11], [12], [13], [14] have suggested that JNK kinase activation plays an important role during necroptosis in L929 cells downstream from RIP1 kinase. For example, the transcription factor c-Jun, a key cellular target of JNK activity, was one of the hits in the genome wide siRNA screen [10]. Activation of JNK in L929 cells has been linked to autocrine TNF\u03b1 synthesis, activation of oxidative stress and induction of autophagy, all of which contribute to necroptosis. Importantly, RIP1 kinase dependent activation of JNK and TNF\u03b1 production has recently been described to be independent of its role in necroptosis [15]. Curiously, Akt kinase, a key pro-survival molecule and a well-established inhibitor of apoptotic cell death, has also recently been linked to necroptosis in L929 cells [16], where insulin-dependent activation of Akt was suggested to promote necroptosis by suppressing autophagy. This conclusion was unexpected, since several reports from different groups, including ours, have established that autophagy promotes, rather than suppresses, zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis in L929 cells [11], [14], [17]. This raised the possibility that Akt controls more general mechanisms that contribute to the execution of necroptosis. Furthermore, the key question of whether insulin-dependent Akt activity solely provides an environment conducive for necroptosis or if Akt activation is an intrinsic component of necroptosis signaling that is linked to RIP1 kinase has not been explored.\nIn this study, we expanded these observations to delineate the specific contributions and molecular ordering of the Akt and JNK pathways downstream from RIP1 kinase during necroptosis. Our data reveal that Akt is activated through RIP1 kinase-dependent Thr308 phosphorylation during necroptosis in multiple cell types. Furthermore, we found that downstream Akt signaling through mTORC1 and S6 contributes to the activation of necroptosis and TNF\u03b1 production. We found that the Akt pathway serves as a critical link between RIP1 kinase and JNK activation in L929 cells. Further data suggested that in multiple other cell types including FADD deficient Jurkat cells, RAW and J774.1 macrophage cell lines, and mouse lung fibroblasts Akt provides a key link to TNF\u03b1 production, but is dispensible for cell death per se. Overall, our results reveal a specific and novel role for the Akt pathway in regulated necrosis and necrosis-associated inflammatory signaling.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":766,"end":770},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":775,"end":779},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1391,"end":1395},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1400,"end":1404},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1598,"end":1602},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1649,"end":1654},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1814,"end":1818},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1942,"end":1946},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1986,"end":1990},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":2261,"end":2268},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":2740,"end":2747},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":2918,"end":2922},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":3106,"end":3110},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":3184,"end":3188},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":3343,"end":3345},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":3395,"end":3399},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":3476,"end":3480},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":3589,"end":3593},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":3710,"end":3714},"obj":"Protein"}]}
