The extent of the band shifts induced by GP was not statistically different when compared to LPS or TSST-1 (Fig. 1B). A supershift, conducted for an NF\u03baB consensus site from the IL-8 promoter, demonstrated a GP-induced predominant binding of NF\u03baB p65 and to a lesser degree of p50 (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, an immunoblot of nuclear extracts from GP-treated PBMC showed a strong binding of NF\u03baB p65 and a weaker reaction of p50, whereas p52 was negative (Fig. 2). Simultaneous co-treatment of PBMC with GP did not change the LPS-induced NF\u03baB binding to oligos from the TNF\u03b1 promoter significantly (Fig. 1B), but substantially decreased the TSST-1-induced NF\u03baB binding when compared to TSST-1 or GP (100 \u03bcg) and thus differed completely from the theoretical value of GP/TSST-1 calc. (n = 4; p \u003C 0.05 vs. GP/TSST-1 calc. and p = 0.07 vs. TSST-1; Fig. 1B). GP was also able to induce band shifts indicative of binding of particular variants of NFAT to an oligo from the IFN\u03b3 promoter (Fig. 1A). An immunoblot for two NFAT subunits demonstrated a GP-induced binding of NFATc2 and to a lesser degree of NFATc1 (Fig. 2).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":34},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":39,"end":43},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":67,"end":71},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":73,"end":77},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":82,"end":86},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":147,"end":153},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":177,"end":183},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":249,"end":255},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":338,"end":342},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":374,"end":378},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":414,"end":418},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":548,"end":554},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":626,"end":630},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":695,"end":698},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":725,"end":728},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":840,"end":843},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":869,"end":872},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":882,"end":885},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1014,"end":1018},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1085,"end":1091},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1130,"end":1136},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1214,"end":1220},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1251,"end":1257},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1281,"end":1287},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1386,"end":1390},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1412,"end":1416},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1459,"end":1463},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1510,"end":1516},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1543,"end":1549},"obj":"Protein"}]}
