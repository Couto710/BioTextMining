PBMC from four normal donors were infected with 1000 TCID50 HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-WT or the mutants HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-\u03baB I-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-\u03baB II-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-\u03baB I+II-Mut, or HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut and either; (A) left untreated, or (B) co-infected with MTb isolate CDC1551 (10\u22361 cells\u2236bacilli). Viral p24 levels in culture supernatants were measured at days 4, 7 and 12 post-infection. (C) Histograms show viral p24 levels at day 12 in the MTb uninfected (grey bars) and MTb co-infected (black bars) PBMC cultures. Replication of the mutant viruses was compared to wild-type virus replication under the same experimental conditions (without and with MTb co-infection, respectively). *, p\u003C0.05; **, p\u003C0.01, as compared to HIV-1Lai/Bal-Env-WT.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":60,"end":65},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":324,"end":327},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":359,"end":362},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":386,"end":389},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":414,"end":417},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":447,"end":450},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":562,"end":565},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":673,"end":676},"obj":"Protein"}]}
