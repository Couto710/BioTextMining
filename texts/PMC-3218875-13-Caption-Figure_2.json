CD40 and RANK can activate the noncanonical NF-\u03baB pathway that is dependent on NF-\u03baB inducing kinase (NIK) expression levels. In unstimulated cells NIK forms a cytosolic complex with the ubiquitin ligases TRAF2, TRAF3 and cIAP1/2, which facilitates the K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NIK, keeping NIK levels low. Upon ligand binding, TRAF3 is recruited to the receptor, where TRAF2 directs nondegradative K63-linked polyubiquitination of cIAP1/2, resulting in their activation. Subsequently cIAP1/2 directs its K48-linked polyubiquitination to TRAF3, rather than NIK. As a result, TRAF3 is degraded and NIK is stabilised, resulting in increased NIK levels in the cell. NIK then phosphorylates and activates IKK1, which mediates NF-\u03baB p100 phosphorylation. This is followed by K48-linked polyubiquitination and partial proteasomal degradation of p100 to p52, which forms a heterodimer with RelB to activate transcription. Next to TRAF3, TRAF1 has also been identified as a negative regulator of this pathway, most probably by competing with other TNF receptor-associated factors. cIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis; IKK, I\u03baB kinase; NF, nuclear factor; RANK, receptor activator of NF-\u03baB; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; TNF, tumour necrosis factor.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":31,"end":35},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":40,"end":44},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":110,"end":131},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":133,"end":136},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":179,"end":182},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":236,"end":241},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":243,"end":248},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":253,"end":258},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":259,"end":260},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":345,"end":348},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":358,"end":361},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":395,"end":400},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":437,"end":442},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":499,"end":504},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":505,"end":506},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":552,"end":557},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":558,"end":559},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":605,"end":610},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":624,"end":627},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":642,"end":647},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":664,"end":667},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":706,"end":709},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":730,"end":733},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":768,"end":772},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":795,"end":799},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":906,"end":910},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":914,"end":917},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":950,"end":954},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":990,"end":995},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":997,"end":1002},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1216,"end":1220},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1222,"end":1249},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1289,"end":1292},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1294,"end":1316},"obj":"Protein"}]}
