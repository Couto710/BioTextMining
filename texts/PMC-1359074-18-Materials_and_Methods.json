DNA-protein complexes were sonicated to 200 and 600 bp. One-tenth of the sample was set aside for input control, and the remaining sample was precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States). Following preclearing, the samples were split into thirds: one sample treated with anti-Sox6, a second treated with normal rabbit IgG, and the third sample without Ab. The last two were used as negative controls. The chromatin-antibody complexes were eluted, and the DNA protein cross-links were reversed with 5 M NaCl at 65 \u00b0C for 4 h. Input DNA or immunoprecipitated DNA was used as a template in the PCR reaction. PCR amplification of the \u025by promoter was performed and yielded a 172-bp amplicon, corresponding to nucleotides \u221231 to +140 of the \u025by promoter (primers MHB1688, 5\u2032CGAAGAATAAAAGGCCACCA3\u2032; and MHB1689, 5\u2032GCTTCACCACCAACCTCTTC3\u2032). PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95 \u00b0C for 15 min followed by 30 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 45 s, ending with a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":580,"end":589},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":751,"end":755},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1105,"end":1107},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1210,"end":1212},"obj":"Protein"}]}
