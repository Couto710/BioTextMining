Subsequently, samples were filtered through a 70 \u00b5m and 40 \u00b5m nylon mesh. For the preparation of BAL, trachea were canulated and airway lumen was flushed 4 times with HBSS with 1 mM EDTA. Cells were stained with monoclonal antibodies directed against MHC-II (I-A/I-E) FITC (M5/114.15.2), CD11c PerCP-Cy5.5 (N418), F4/80 APC (BM8), CD62L PE (MEL-14), Granzyme B FITC (NGZB) from eBiosciences and CD3 Molecular Complex Horizon v450 (17A2), Ly6C Horizon v450 (AL-21), Ly6G PE (1A8), CD11b APC-Cy7 (M1/70), CD8\u03b1 PerCP (53-6.7), IFN\u03b3 Alexa 647 (XMG1.2) and CD16/32 (2.4G2) from BD Pharmingen. Samples were acquired on a LSRII Cytometer and analyzed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Propidium iodide was used to discriminate between live and dead cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":55,"end":74},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":471,"end":476},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":490,"end":500},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":535,"end":538},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":605,"end":609},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":643,"end":647},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":664,"end":668},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":692,"end":696},"obj":"Protein"}]}
