(B) Cold competition EMSAs performed with the radiolabelled murine SerpinB2 promoter \u2212212/\u2212185 probe and a 100-fold molar excess of each of the double stranded oligonucleotides described in (A) demonstrate the specificity of the DNA-protein complexes. (C) Supershift assays were performed with the \u2212212/\u2212185 probe by after preincubation with the indicated specific C/EBP antibody. The LPS-inducible complex is indicated with an arrowhead.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":52,"end":60},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":99,"end":106},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":236,"end":244},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":292,"end":300},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":361,"end":368},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":400,"end":407},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":489,"end":497},"obj":"Protein"}]}
