PBMC were resuspended in 80 \u03bcl of FBS staining buffer. Anti-CD4 microbeads (20 \u03bcl) were added and incubated for 15 min at 6\u201312\u00b0C. Saturating amounts of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies were added for a further 10 min. Cells were diluted in 2.5 ml of FBS staining buffer, pelleted, resuspended in 500 \u03bcl and magnetically separated, usually on an AutoMACS magnet fitted with a MACS MS column. Flow-through and two 1 ml washes were collected as the negative fraction. Enriched cells were collected in two 0.5 ml aliquots from the column after removal from the magnet. Alternatively, cells stained with anti-CD4\u2013phycoerythrin were washed, magnetically labeled with anti-phycoerythrin microbeads (20 \u03bcl added to 80 \u03bcl of cell suspension; 15 min, 6\u201312\u00b0C), and magnetically separated as described above. The purity of cells was assessed by flow cytometric analysis of stained cells on a FACS Vantage sorter. Most (more than 97%) of the isolated cells had the CD4 T cell marker.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":35,"end":38},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":184,"end":187},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":730,"end":733},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1078,"end":1081},"obj":"Protein"}]}
