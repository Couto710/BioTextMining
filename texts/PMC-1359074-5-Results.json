To determine whether the persistent expression of \u025by globin is due to residual primitive erythrocytes or is due to ectopic expression of \u025by globin in definitive erythrocytes, we examined the spatial pattern of \u025by globin transcripts in mouse embryos by in situ hybridization (Figure 5). As expected, \u025by globin is not expressed in the WT 14.5-dpc liver, the site of definitive erythropoiesis in the fetus. In contrast, abundant ectopic \u025by mRNA expression is seen in the liver of 14.5-dpc mutants (Figure 5 A\u2013D). However, the expression of \u03b2maj/min globin is equally abundant in both WT and p100H mutant mice (Figure 5 E and F). These data demonstrate that the persistent high levels of \u025by are due to ectopic expression in the definitive erythroid cells that mature in the fetal liver, suggesting that there is an intrinsic defect of the \u025by silencing mechanism in Sox6-null mice.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":29,"end":38},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":42,"end":46},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":88,"end":90},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":160,"end":169},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":317,"end":326},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":404,"end":413},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":477,"end":486},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":566,"end":575},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":701,"end":703},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":804,"end":808},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":809,"end":819},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":951,"end":953},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1102,"end":1104},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1128,"end":1132},"obj":"Protein"}]}
