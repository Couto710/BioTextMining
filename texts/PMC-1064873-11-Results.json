IL-10R1 expression plays a critical role in cellular responses to IL-10 [29]. To examine whether the resistance to IL-10 inhibition in RA CD4+ T cells was due to limited receptor expression, the cell surface expression of IL-10R1 on PB CD4+ T cells from active RA patients and from healthy controls was determined by flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Fig. 3a,3b, the intensity of IL-10R1 expression on CD4+ T cells was significantly increased in RA patients compared with in healthy controls. These results suggest that the intracellular signal transduction pathway of IL-10 may be impaired in CD4+ T cells of active RA.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":37,"end":44},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":51,"end":54},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":99,"end":104},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":168,"end":175},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":204,"end":217},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":223,"end":230},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":289,"end":294},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":338,"end":343},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":361,"end":364},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":445,"end":452},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":459,"end":462},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":607,"end":614},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":629,"end":632},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":796,"end":801},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":821,"end":824},"obj":"Protein"}]}
