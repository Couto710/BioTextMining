B, Expression of p50 and p65 phosphorylation in nuclear extracts (NE), and I\u03baB and I\u03baB phosphorylation in the cytosol (CE) determined by Western blotting. C, Immunolfluorescence analysis of p50 confirmed that the intensities of nuclear staining for p50 were decreased in the tumor tissues of CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice. Data are means \u00b1 S.D. of four experimental animals. * indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (p\u003C0.05). Scale bar indicates 50 \u00b5m.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":46,"end":50},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":143,"end":147},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":160,"end":164},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":247,"end":250},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":255,"end":258},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":420,"end":423},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":479,"end":482},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":522,"end":526},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":628,"end":632},"obj":"Protein"}]}
