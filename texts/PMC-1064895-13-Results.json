On the basis of this, we chose 10 \u03bcg/ml as a stimulation concentration for anti-CD3. As shown in Table 1, anti-CD3 significantly upregulated IL-17 production up to 3.7-fold, and the combination of anti-CD28 and anti-CD3 produced more IL-17 (approximately 1.3-1.5-fold) than anti-CD3 alone. Furthermore, when incubated with T cell mitogens such as PHA, increased IL-17 production was more pronounced than with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (588 \u00b1 85 versus 211 \u00b1 1 pg/ml; P \u003C 0.05).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":15},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":79,"end":83},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":89,"end":92},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":101,"end":106},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":343,"end":348},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":515,"end":520},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":576,"end":580},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":608,"end":613},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":721,"end":724},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":736,"end":741},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":801,"end":805},"obj":"Protein"}]}
