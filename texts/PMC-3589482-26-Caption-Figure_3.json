Mouse and human nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal W software. Cis-acting elements conserved between the human and murine SerpinB2 promoters are boxed and labeled.

The putative transcription initiation site (tis) is indicated and exon 1 is presented in uppercase. The location of the 5' ends of the \u2212539, \u2212189 and \u221287 reporter constructs are also shown.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":84,"end":92},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":246,"end":254},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":387,"end":391},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":395,"end":425},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":426,"end":432},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":434,"end":438},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":442,"end":470},"obj":"Protein"}]}
