Gelatine Zymography\nCells of four groups were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50\u2009mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150\u2009mM NaCl, 5\u2009mM CaCl2, 0.2\u2009mM NaN3, and 0.01% Triton. Soluble extracts were separated by centrifugation and stored at \u201320\u00b0C. Gelatin zymography was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Genmed Scientifics Inc, MA, USA). Briefly, 40\u2009\u03bcg cytosolic protein extracts were separated by electrophoresis. Then the proteins were renatured by incubation in 2.5% Triton X-100 and then incubated in substrate buffer for 40\u2009h at 37\u00b0C to enable the MMP9 to cleave the gelatin. After rinsing in water, each gel was stained with Coomassie blue for 1\u2009h and destained in 50% methanol. Proteolytic activities were showed by clear bands in blue gel which indicates the lysis of the substrate. Quantification of MMP9 band density was performed with image analysis program ImageJ.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":570,"end":574},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":826,"end":830},"obj":"Protein"}]}
