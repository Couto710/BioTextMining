In order to determine whether the DNA binding proteins activated by GP were related to NF\u03baB and NFAT, an immuno(dot) blot was performed. A representative dot blot showing staining of negative and positive controls (recombinant proteins NF\u03baB p52, c-rel; nuclear extracts of PMA-treated Jurkat cells positive for NF\u03baB p50, p65 and for NFATc1, c2) in the upper panel and staining of nuclear extracts of GP-treated PBMC (positive for NF\u03baB p65, p50 and NFAT c2, c1) in the lower panel is shown (n = 3).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":5,"end":8},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":9,"end":12},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":17,"end":23},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":24,"end":26},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":164,"end":168},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":309,"end":312},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":314,"end":319},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":384,"end":387},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":389,"end":392},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":401,"end":407},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":409,"end":411},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":503,"end":506},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":508,"end":511},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":516,"end":523},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":525,"end":527},"obj":"Protein"}]}
