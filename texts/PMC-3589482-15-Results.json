We reasoned that the presence of evolutionarily conserved, potential transcription factor binding sites in this region might play a role in the regulation of SerpinB2 gene expression [52]. The presence of several repetitive sequence elements delineated five broadly homologous regions (A-E) between the human and murine promoters (Fig. 2C). The proximal promoter (Region E), which contains the essential LPS response element, exhibited the greatest homology. Further analysis of Region E revealed that several of the cis-acting regulatory elements defined in the human SerpinB2 proximal promoter are conserved in the murine SerpinB2 promoter (Fig. 3). Specifically, a TATA consensus sequence is located 23 to 29bp upstream from the transcription initiation site, similar to the position of the TATA box of the human SERPINB2 gene [53]; [54]. A putative CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site is present at \u2212192/\u2212203, two potential activator protein 1 (AP-1) binding sites are found at nucleotides \u221288/\u221294 and \u2212100/\u2212106, and a putative cyclic AMP response element (CRE) is present at \u2212172/\u2212177. Both of the AP-1 sites are identical in sequence to those identified in the human SERPINB2 promoter, and the CRE differs in the identity of a single central nucleotide [37]; [55]. A consensus E box (\u2212538/\u2212533), as well as potential binding sites for PU.1 (\u2212412/\u2212407) and Oct-1 (\u2212296/\u2212288) were also identified within the proximal promoter region (Fig. S2). Further upstream, a retinoic acid response element at \u22121349/\u22121340, a PAUSE-1 silencer element at \u22121540/\u22121528 and a NF-\u03baB p65 binding site at \u22121342/\u22121351 (Fig. S2) are also well conserved [16]; [30]; [56].","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":50,"end":58},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":167,"end":175},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":238,"end":246},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":426,"end":434},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":837,"end":845},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":892,"end":900},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1084,"end":1092},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1449,"end":1457},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1617,"end":1621},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1638,"end":1643},"obj":"Protein"}]}
