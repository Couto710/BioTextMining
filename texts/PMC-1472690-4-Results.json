We investigated previoulsy described and newly discovered transcription factor binding sites of the IL-1RA promoter (Table 1) using the program OMIGA (v.1.1.3, Oxford Molecular, Oxford, UK). The LPS responsive \u03baB consensus site of LRE-1 (between -84 and -93) [30] displayed band shifts, but no significant alterations of its binding activity, irrespective of the treatment (data not shown). A new \u03baB3 site (-100 and -130) within the LRE-1 [30] showed increased binding induced by TSST-1 (+30% vs. control), but GP co-treatment up-regulated the LPS (+65% vs. control)- and the TSST-1 (+110% vs. control)-induced binding in a superadditive synergistic fashion, when compared to medium control as well as to LPS, TSST-1 or GP or the theoretical values of GP/LPS calc. or GP/TSST-1 calc. (all p \u003C 0.05; Fig. 4). Binding to a new \u03baB consensus site (between -266 and -280) was significantly elevated for GP + TSST-1 (p \u003C 0.05; data not shown). The LPS-, TSST-1- and GP + LPS-induced binding to the new \u03baB2/3 site (-288 and -302) was down-regulated by about 20\u201335% in comparison with medium control (p \u003C 0.05; data not shown). The NFIL-6 site (-147 and -170) close to LRE-2 [31,32] showed an up-regulation of binding for all compounds and combinations vs. medium control, ranging from 25\u2013110% (p \u003C 0.05). Further, GP + TSST-1 induced an increased binding to the NFIL-6 site in comparison with TSST-1 (1.3fold) or GP (1.6fold; p \u003C 0.05), (data not shown). A new binding site for NFATP2/3 was found more distal of the transcription start site, between -471 and -490, displaying again a substantial increase of binding for all compounds and combinations, when compared to medium control (p \u003C 0.05). In addition, binding to the NFATP2/3 site following both, GP + LPS (1.4fold of GP) and GP + TSST-1 (1.5fold of GP, 1.25fold of TSST-1) was elevated (p \u003C 0.05; Fig. 5), but only in an additive synergistic manner, i.e. the experimental results were not different from the theoretical values (calc.).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":20},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":25,"end":29},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":47,"end":53},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":80,"end":86},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":95,"end":101},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":197,"end":201},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":203,"end":207},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":211,"end":215},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":301,"end":307},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":418,"end":424},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":798,"end":804},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":894,"end":900},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1028,"end":1034},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1089,"end":1095},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1221,"end":1227},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1266,"end":1272},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1630,"end":1636},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1704,"end":1710},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":2099,"end":2105},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":2134,"end":2140},"obj":"Protein"}]}
