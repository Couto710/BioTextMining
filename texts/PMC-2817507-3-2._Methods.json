Induction of Intracerebral Hemorrhage\nSince most intracerebral hemorrhages occur in the basal ganglia clinically, in the present study, rat model of ICH was induced in left basal ganglia. Rats were anesthetized with intra-peritoneal sodium pentobarbital (60\u2009mg/kg). The body (rectal) temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C during the surgery using a feedback-controlled heating system. The rats were positioned in a stereotactic frame, and the scalp was incised along the midline. Using a sterile technique, a 1\u2009mm burr hole was opened in the skull on the left coronal suture 3\u2009mm lateral to the midline. A blunt 26-gauge needle was inserted into the left basal ganglia under stereotactic guidance (coordinates: 0.2\u2009mm anterior, 6.0\u2009mm ventral, and 3.0\u2009mm lateral to the midline). Then, a 75\u2009\u03bcL of autologous whole blood was infused at a rate of 20\u2009\u03bcL/min with the use of a microinfusion pump. After the completion of the infusion, the needle was withdrawn quickly, cyanoacrylate glue was placed around the burr hole, and the skin incision was closed with sutures. For the normal saline control rats, only 75\u2009\u03bcL normal saline was injected.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins"}
