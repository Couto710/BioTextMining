The physicochemical characteristics of GP were determined as reported previously [20,26]. GP was dissolved in aqueous media, filter-sterilized (0.2 \u03bcm) and screened for endotoxin contamination with the Endospecy assay (Seigakaku, Tokyo, Japan), which is specific for endotoxin but does not respond to \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucans.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins"}
