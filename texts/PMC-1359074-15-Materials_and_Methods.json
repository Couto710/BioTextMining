The Sox6 in vitro translation expression vector, tagged with c-Myc and HA, was described before [15]. The translation was performed in a reticulocyte lysate based in vitro translational system (TNT\u00ae Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems, Promega). A vector without the Sox6 coding sequence was also translated as a negative control.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":52,"end":56},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":183,"end":187},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":240,"end":245},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":250,"end":252},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":458,"end":462},"obj":"Protein"}]}
