Time course (48 h) of IL-1\u03b2 production (pg/ml) by human PBMC incubated with medium control, 100 \u03bcg GP, 250 ng TSST-1, GP + TSST-1, 250 ng LPS and GP + LPS. At 18 h and 24 h there was a marked reduction in IL-1\u03b2 production following GP + TSST-1 when compared to TSST-1 (* = p \u003C 0.05). Graphs depicting the theoretical values for GP/LPS calc. and GP/TSST-1 calc. are also shown. IL-1\u03b2 levels in the supernatnant were obtained by Elisa and are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 3). B, IL-1RA was exaggerated following GP + TSST-1 (12 h \u2013 48 h) when compared to TSST-1. Time course (48 h) of IL-1RA production (pg/ml) by human PBMC incubated with medium control, 100 \u03bcg GP, 250 ng TSST-1, GP + TSST-1, 250 ng LPS and GP + LPS. Between 18 h and 48 h a simultaneous treatment of PBMC with GP + TSST-1 led to a synergistic effect, i.e. a higher IL-1RA production when compared to an addition of the single values for TSST-1 and GP (* = p \u003C 0.05). Graphs depicting the theoretical values for GP/LPS calc. and GP/TSST-1 calc. are included. IL-1RA levels in the supernatnant were obtained by Elisa and are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 3).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":3,"end":8},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":57,"end":63},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":81,"end":87},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":111,"end":116},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":199,"end":205},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":212,"end":218},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":294,"end":299},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":326,"end":332},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":350,"end":356},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":437,"end":443},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":466,"end":471},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":562,"end":568},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":600,"end":606},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":638,"end":644},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":668,"end":674},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":757,"end":763},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":770,"end":776},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":868,"end":874},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":918,"end":924},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":990,"end":996},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1084,"end":1090},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1111,"end":1117},"obj":"Protein"}]}
