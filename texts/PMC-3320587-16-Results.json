We prepared MDM from five normal donors, stimulated the cells with the MTb lysate or left them unstimulated, and measured NFAT5 gene expression levels by quantitative real-time PCR at 24 and 48 hours. We also investigated whether HIV-1 infection is capable of inducing NFAT5 mRNA synthesis by infecting MDM with live or heat-inactivated R5-tropic representatives of subtype B (HIV-1Bal), C (HIV-198IN22), or E (HIV-192TH64). As shown in Figure 2A, stimulation with MTb lysate significantly increased NFAT5 mRNA levels at 24 (p\u003C0.05) and 48 (p\u003C0.01) hours, whereas infection with viable or heat-inactivated HIV-1 isolates did not increase NFAT5 mRNA levels (Figure 2A). Thus, MTb specifically enhances NFAT5 mRNA expression in human MDM, and this response continues to increase for at least 48 hours post-stimulation (Figure 2A).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":19},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":243,"end":248},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":409,"end":414},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":556,"end":561},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":787,"end":792},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":925,"end":930},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":988,"end":993},"obj":"Protein"}]}
