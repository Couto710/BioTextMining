To test the binding specificity of the oligos, mutated oligos were used as an additional control. Mutations in the P2 site of the IFN\u03b3 promoter [29] and in the \u03ba consensus sequence of the TNF\u03b1 promoter [55] have been reported to interfere with sequences, which seem to be crucial for the binding of NFAT and NF\u03baB proteins, respectively. Afterwards, the ds oligos were purified via gel filtration using Probe Quant G-50 Micro Columns (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":121,"end":125},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":127,"end":131},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":133,"end":137},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":142,"end":146},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":612,"end":616},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":670,"end":674},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":781,"end":785},"obj":"Protein"}]}
