Cultures were stimulated for 1 h (EMSA) or from 0 h to 48 h (ELISA) with 1 or 100 \u03bcg per 106 cells of GP, with 250 ng/106 cells TSST-1 (Toxin Technologies, Sarasota, FL, USA) or with 250 ng/106 cells wild-type LPS from Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4 (Sigma, Munich, Germany). In costimulatory experiments, PBMC were supplemented simultaneously with a combination of GP and TSST-1 or with a combination of GP and LPS.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":321,"end":327},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":569,"end":575},"obj":"Protein"}]}
