The location of the 5\u2032 ends of the \u2212539, \u2212189 and \u221287 reporter constructs is also shown. Positions of murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter-specific primers, 338/\u2212315 and \u22125/+19 used in ChIP assays are indicated. (B) RAW 264.7 macrophages were transiently transfected with the indicated murine SerpinB2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs and either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 16 hrs. The results show relative luciferase activity following LPS treatment and represent the mean and SEM of 4\u20137 independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":88,"end":96},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":173,"end":181},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":384,"end":392},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":565,"end":602},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":708,"end":718},"obj":"Protein"}]}
