Necroptosis was induced by the addition of zVAD.fmk under serum free conditions (A) or serum or serum free conditions with Nec-1 (B). Viability assays were performed after 24 hr. (C) Myr-Akt and Myr-Akt K179M cells were treated with zVAD.fmk and/or Nec-1 under serum free conditions for 9 hr, followed by western blot using the indicated antibodies. Endogenous Akt (\u223c) and Myr-Akt (*) bands are indicated. (D) L929 cells, stably infected with Myr-Akt and Myr-Akt K179KM, were stimulated with zVAD.fmk for 9 hr under serum free conditions. TNF\u03b1 mRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR and normalized using mouse 18S RNA. (E-G) L929 cells expressing Myr-Akt and Ala and Asp mutants of Thr308 and Ser473 were treated with zVAD.fmk under serum free conditions, followed by viability assay at 24 hr (E), western blot at 9 hr (F), or evaluation of TNF\u03b1 mRNA levels by qRT-PCR at 9 hrs (G). In all graphs, average\u00b1SD was plotted.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":772,"end":776},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":843,"end":846},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1074,"end":1078},"obj":"Protein"}]}
