Here, we demonstrate that silencing of the expression of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) by RNA interference (RNAi) inhibits Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb)-stimulated HIV-1 replication in co-infected macrophages. We show that NFAT5 gene and protein expression are strongly induced by MTb, which is a Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand, and that an intact NFAT5 binding site in the viral promoter of R5-tropic HIV-1 subtype B and subtype C molecular clones is required for efficent induction of HIV-1 replication by MTb. Furthermore, silencing by RNAi of key components of the TLR pathway in human monocytes, including the downstream signaling molecules MyD88, IRAK1, and TRAF6, significantly inhibits MTb-induced NFAT5 gene expression. Thus, the innate immune response to MTb infection induces NFAT5 gene and protein expression, and NFAT5 plays a crucial role in MTb regulation of HIV-1 replication via a direct interaction with the viral promoter. These findings also demonstrate a general role for NFAT5 in TLR- and MTb-mediated control of gene expression.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":93,"end":98},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":436,"end":473},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":475,"end":480},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":621,"end":626},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1045,"end":1050},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1052,"end":1057},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1063,"end":1068},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1105,"end":1110},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1186,"end":1191},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1225,"end":1230},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1392,"end":1397},"obj":"Protein"}]}
