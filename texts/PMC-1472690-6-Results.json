As expected, an inhibition of NF\u03baB via CAPE [35] and CyA, NFAT via CyA and NFIL-6 via CHX [36] could not be overruled by GP, leading to a down-regulated binding activity of the transcription factors to the IL-1RA sites, and a reduction of IL-1RA mRNA and IL-1RA protein levels (Fig. 7). The extent of reduction in NFATP2/3 binding is exemplarily shown in an autoradiogram (Fig. 7A, left side) and graphically summarized (n = 4, Fig. 7A, right side). The results for the NF\u03baB and NFIL-6 binding sites were similar (data not shown). Because the highest IL-1RA amount was found at 24 h, mRNA was examined following 1 h inhibition and 18 h of GP. A representative gel demonstrating a decrease in IL-1RA mRNA after inhibition with CAPE, CyA and CHX is displayed in Fig. 7B (n = 4). In addition, corresponding IL-1RA protein levels after 24 h of GP are shown in Fig. 7C (n = 3). Altogether, NF\u03baB inhibition by CAPE was more pronounced at the binding activity and the transcription, whereas CyA and CHX mainly led to a decreased IL-1RA release.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":51,"end":57},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":164,"end":170},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":214,"end":220},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":286,"end":290},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":303,"end":309},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":434,"end":440},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":467,"end":473},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":483,"end":489},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":779,"end":785},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":920,"end":926},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1032,"end":1038},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1250,"end":1256},"obj":"Protein"}]}
