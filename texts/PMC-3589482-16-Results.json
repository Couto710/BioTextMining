As shown in Fig. 4B, mutation of the consensus E box (\u2212538/\u2212533), PU.1 (\u2212412/\u2212407), or the variant Oct-1 (\u2212296/\u2212288) site did not decrease LPS-induced promoter activity. In contrast, mutation of the C/EBP site (\u2212203/\u2212192) completely eliminated promoter activity, similar to the levels observed for the \u2212189 SerpinB2 promoter deletion construct. Others have also recently implicated this C/EBP site in LPS-induced activation of the SerpinB2 gene [58].\nConsidering the conserved sequence and position of the CRE and two AP-1 sites in the murine SerpinB2 promoter and their demonstrated involvement in the PMA-responsiveness of the human SERPINB2 promoter [37], these sites were also mutated by nucleotide substitution to investigate whether they played a role in the LPS response of the murine SerpinB2 promoter. As shown in Fig. 4B, mutation of the CRE at \u2212177/\u2212172 or either of the two AP-1 sites at \u2212106/\u2212100 and \u221294/\u221288, completely or significantly reduced LPS-inducible luciferase activity from the murine SerpinB2 promoter. These data show that the C/EBP element, as well as the CRE and both AP-1 cis-acting elements are critical for LPS-inducible transcription from the SerpinB2 proximal promoter.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":46,"end":54},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":483,"end":525},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":854,"end":862},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":978,"end":986},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1090,"end":1098},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1182,"end":1190},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1339,"end":1347},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1520,"end":1530},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1556,"end":1564},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1722,"end":1730},"obj":"Protein"}]}
