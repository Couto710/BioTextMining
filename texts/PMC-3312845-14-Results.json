To confirm TNF-\u03b1-mediated signaling following SE, we performed an immunohistochemical study using five phospho-NF-\u03baB antibodies. Compared to non-SE animals (data not shown), 12 hr-post SE animals of the saline-infused group showed p65-Ser276, p65-Ser311, p65-Ser529, and p65-Ser536 phosphorylation in astrocytes (not endothelial cells). sTNFp55R infusion effectively reduced p65-Ser276 and p65-Ser311 phosphorylation (p \u003C 0.05, respectively), while it could not affect p65-Ser529 or p65-Ser536 phosphorylation (Figures 3 and 4A). In contrast, p65-Thr435 phosphorylation was increased in endothelial cells (not astrocytes) within the PC of saline-infused animals 12 hr after SE (Figure 5A). In addition, sTNFp55R infusion effectively alleviated SE-induced p65-Thr435 phosphorylation in endothelial cells, compared to saline infusion (p \u003C 0.05, Figure 5B).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":50,"end":55},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":128,"end":133},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":348,"end":351},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":360,"end":363},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":372,"end":375},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":388,"end":391},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":455,"end":462},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":492,"end":495},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":507,"end":510},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":586,"end":589},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":600,"end":603},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":660,"end":663},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":821,"end":828},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":872,"end":875},"obj":"Protein"}]}
