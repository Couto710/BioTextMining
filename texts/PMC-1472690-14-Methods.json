The nuclear proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking with PBS/3% BSA (Fluka, Deisenhofen, Germany), the blot was incubated overnight with the primary antibodies diluted 1:2000 in PBS/1% BSA, washed again and incubated with the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500 in PBS/1% BSA). The blot was developed using the Vectastain\u00ae staining kit (Vector Laboratories Inc. Burlingame, CA, USA).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":89,"end":93},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":347,"end":350},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":370,"end":375},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":476,"end":479},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":504,"end":507},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":530,"end":533},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":589,"end":594},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":615,"end":621},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":643,"end":649},"obj":"Protein"}]}
