BAL fluid was collected from wild type (A20myel-WT) and A20myel-KO mice 6 days following infection with a lethal dose IAV and KC, MIP-2, MCP-1, IL-6 and IFN\u03b1 protein levels were determined (C). Absolute numbers of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes in BAL were analyzed by flow cytometry at 6 days p.i. (D). Numbers are averages +/\u2212 SEM of at least 5 mice per group. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments. *p\u003C0.05; **p\u003C0.01, ***p\u003C0.001.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":405,"end":407},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":409,"end":414},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":416,"end":421},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":423,"end":427},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":432,"end":436},"obj":"Protein"}]}
