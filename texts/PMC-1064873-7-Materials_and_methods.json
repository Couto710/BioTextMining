Real-time PCR was performed with the LightCycler Instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) in glass capillaries. The reaction mix containing Taq DNA polymerase and DNA double-strand-specific SYBR Green I dye (Lightcycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I; Roche Diagnostics) and specific primers were added to cDNA dilutions.\nThe cDNA samples were denatured at 95\u00b0 C for 10 min, and were then amplified for 40\u201350 cycles: at 95\u00b0 C (10 s), at 65\u00b0 C (15 s), and 72\u00b0 C (22 s) for \u03b2-actin; at 95\u00b0 C (10 s), at 62\u00b0 C (15 s), and at 72\u00b0 C (10 s) for SOCS1; and at 96\u00b0 C (10 s), at 68\u00b0 C (15 s), and at 72\u00b0 C (15 s) for SOCS3. Amplification curves of the fluorescence values versus cycle number were obtained, and a melting curve analysis was then performed. The levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression were determined by normalizing relative to \u03b2-actin expression. The forward and reverse primers were as follows: for \u03b2-actin, 5'-GTGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCA-3' and 5'-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3' ; for SOCS1, 5'-AGACCCCTTCTCACCTCTTG-3' and 5'-GCACAGCAGAAAAATAAAGC-3' ; and for SOCS3, 5'-CCCGCCGGCACCTTTCTG-3' and 5'-AGGGGCCGGCTCAACACC-3'.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":77,"end":80},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":541,"end":544},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":876,"end":883},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":943,"end":948},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1012,"end":1017},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1165,"end":1170},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1175,"end":1180},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1235,"end":1242},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1308,"end":1315},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1385,"end":1390},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1460,"end":1465},"obj":"Protein"}]}
