To elucidate the mechanism of SE-induced vasogenic edema, we investigated the roles of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption during vasogenic edema and its related events in rat epilepsy models provoked by pilocarpine-induced SE.\nMethods\nSE was induced by pilocarpine in rats that were intracerebroventricularly infused with saline-, and soluble TNF p55 receptor (sTNFp55R) prior to SE induction. Thereafter, we performed Fluoro-Jade B staining and immunohistochemical studies for TNF-\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB subunits.\nResults\nFollowing SE, most activated microglia showed strong TNF-\u03b1 immunoreactivity. In addition, TNF p75 receptor expression was detected in endothelial cells as well as astrocytes. In addition, only p65-Thr435 phosphorylation was increased in endothelial cells accompanied by SMI-71 expression (an endothelial barrier antigen). Neutralization of TNF-\u03b1 by soluble TNF p55 receptor (sTNFp55R) infusion attenuated SE-induced vasogenic edema and neuronal damages via inhibition of p65-Thr435 phosphorylation in endothelial cells. Furthermore, sTNFp55R infusion reduced SE-induced neutrophil infiltration in the PC.\nConclusion\nThese findings suggest that impairments of endothelial cell functions via TNF-\u03b1-mediated p65-Thr 485 NF-\u03baB phosphorylation may be involved in SE-induced vasogenic edema. Subsequently, vasogenic edema results in extensive neutrophil infiltration and neuronal-astroglial loss.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":23},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":66,"end":69},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":454,"end":483},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":745,"end":761},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":764,"end":771},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":880,"end":885},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":967,"end":972},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1004,"end":1020},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1107,"end":1110},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1254,"end":1259},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1271,"end":1287},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1290,"end":1297},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1385,"end":1388},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1448,"end":1455},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1604,"end":1609},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1619,"end":1622},"obj":"Protein"}]}
