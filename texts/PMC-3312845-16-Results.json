Indeed, we have reported massive neutrophil infiltration in layer III/IV of the PC 1 day after SE [20]. In the present study, 1 day-post-SE animals of the saline-infused group showed infiltration of MPO-positive neutrophils into the PC. Similarly, 1 day-post-SE animals of the sTNFp55R-infused group showed neutrophil infiltration into the PC 1 day after SE (Figure 6A). The number of neutrophils/area in the PC region (including the vasogenic edema region and the non-vasogenic edema region) of sTNFp55R-infused animals was significantly lower than that of the saline-infused group (Figure 6D, p \u003C 0.05). However, there was no difference in neutrophil infiltration per unit area of vasogenic edema between the saline- and sTNFp55R-infused groups (Figure 6D). Furthermore, neutrophil infiltration showed a direct proportion to the area of vasogenic edema, with a linear coefficient of correlation of 0.8631 (p \u003C 0.05, Figure 6E). Therefore, our findings indicate that SE-induced neutrophil infiltration into the PC may be correlated to TNF-\u03b1-mediated vasogenic edema formation.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":413,"end":420},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":632,"end":639},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":859,"end":866},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1171,"end":1176},"obj":"Protein"}]}
