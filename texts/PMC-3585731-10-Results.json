Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD)-deficient Jurkat T lymphocytes and the macrophage cell lines (J774A.1 and RAW264.7) are other models of necroptosis, which can be induced by stimulation with TNF\u03b1 or zVAD.fmk, respectively [17]. Similar to L929 cells, a RIP1 kinase dependent increase in the phosphorylation of Thr308 on Akt occurred during necroptosis (Fig. 8B,D,F) in these cell types. Furthermore, TNF\u03b1 mRNA levels were increased in each of these cell types during necroptosis and efficiently inhibited by both RIP1 and Akt inhibitors (Fig. 8A,C,E). However, inhibition of Akt did not protect these cells from death (Fig. S9A,B,C). These results indicate that regulation of autocrine TNF\u03b1 synthesis and necroptosis-associated inflammatory signaling may be a more important function of Akt pathway activation by RIP1 kinase in multiple cell types compared to its contribution to cell death.\nWe next chose to look at the role of Akt in necroptosis in mouse lung fibroblasts. Lung fibroblasts selected to survive after deletion of all three Akt isoforms [40] were resistant to cell death induced by the addition of TNF\u03b1 and zVAD.fmk. Expression of catalytically active Akt (Myr-Akt) in these cells restored TNF\u03b1 mRNA production in response to TNF\u03b1 and zVAD.fmk (Fig. 8G) without re-establishing cell death (Fig. S9D). Consistent with our earlier Akt knockdown data, lung fibroblasts expressing endogenous Akt1 or Akt2 were phosphorylated on Thr308 in response to TNF\u03b1 and zVAD.fmk (Fig. S9E) and in both cases robust RIP1-dependent TNF\u03b1 mRNA upregulation occurred under necroptotic conditions (Fig. 8H). These data further support the notion that Akt activity is critical for autocrine TNF\u03b1 synthesis, even in the absence of necroptotic cell death, indicating an unexpected differentiation between Akt-mediated inflammatory signaling under necroptotic conditions and cell death per se.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":13,"end":17},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":80,"end":84},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":234,"end":274},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":276,"end":280},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":440,"end":444},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":502,"end":506},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":649,"end":653},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":762,"end":766},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":935,"end":939},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1062,"end":1066},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1363,"end":1367},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1455,"end":1459},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1491,"end":1495},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1653,"end":1657},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1661,"end":1665},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1711,"end":1715},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1765,"end":1769},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1780,"end":1784},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1934,"end":1938},"obj":"Protein"}]}
