Lentiviruses encoding shRNA sequences were generated by transfecting the packaging cell line HEK-293T with the shRNA-encoding pLKO.1 plasmids in combination with the packaging plasmid psPAX2 and the envelope plasmid pMD2.G using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, www.qiagen.com). Supernatants were collected 48 hours post-transfection, clarified by centrifugation, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. THP-1 cells were transduced with the lentiviral particles by culturing the cells with supernatants from the virus-producing cells in the presence of 8 \u00b5g/ml polybrene (Millipore, www.millipore.com) and spinoculation for two hours at 2000 RPM. Successfully transduced cells were selected and expanded by treatment with 0.8 \u00b5g/ml puromycin.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":30,"end":35},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":77,"end":82},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":99,"end":104},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":224,"end":229},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":392,"end":397},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":444,"end":449},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":607,"end":612},"obj":"Protein"}]}
