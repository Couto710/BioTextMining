As shown in Fig. 7a, nuclear extracts from RA PBMC stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (lane 2) demonstrated increased binding of NF-\u03baB to IL-17 promoters in comparison with that of controls (lane 1). A supershift assay demonstrated shifted bands in p65 and p50 (lanes 3 and 4) not in c-Rel (lane 5). In normal PBMC the same pattern was observed, but the degree of NF-\u03baB activation by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 was less intense than that in RA PBMC (Fig. 7b). To confirm the link between PI3K activity and NF-\u03baB, we performed EMSA to determine the NF-\u03baB binding activity after treatment with both LY294002 and PDTC. Both agents block NF-\u03baB DNA-binding activity in the IL-17 promoter (Fig. 7c). Western blotting for I\u03baB-\u03b1 showed inhibition of degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 by LY294002 and PDTC at the same time (Fig. 7c). In contrast, the AP-1 pathway was not activated by stimulation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (data not shown), demonstrating that NF-\u03baB is the main intracellular signaling pathway in IL-17 production by activated PBMC from patients with RA.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":47},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":49,"end":53},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":70,"end":75},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":183,"end":187},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":205,"end":208},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":213,"end":218},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":249,"end":254},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":374,"end":379},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":467,"end":471},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":524,"end":529},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":635,"end":638},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":643,"end":646},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":670,"end":675},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":789,"end":793},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1051,"end":1056},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1098,"end":1103},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1140,"end":1145},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1212,"end":1216},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1282,"end":1286},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1377,"end":1382},"obj":"Protein"}]}
