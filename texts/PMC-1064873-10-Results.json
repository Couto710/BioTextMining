To evaluate the responsiveness of RA CD4+ T cells to IL-10, purified PB CD4+ T cells from three patients with active RA and from three healthy controls were stimulated by immobilized anti-CD3 antibody and anti-CD28 antibody with or without diluted concentrations of IL-10 for 36 hours, and IFN-\u03b3 production was measured by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1, IFN-\u03b3 production by activated normal CD4+ T cells was mostly inhibited at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml IL-10. However, RA CD4+ T cells were able to produce significant amounts of IFN-\u03b3 in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10, and the maximal but not complete inhibition by IL-10 was obtained at 10\u2013100 ng/ml.\nWe thus compared the levels of IFN-\u03b3 production by CD4+ T cells after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 in RA patients with active disease (multiple inflammatory joints, CRP level \u2265 10 mg/l) and inactive disease (in remission, CRP level \u003C 10 mg/l) [26] and in healthy controls. There were no statistically significant differences in IFN-\u03b3 production without IL-10 among these three groups (Fig. 2a), but the inhibitory effect of IL-10 on IFN-\u03b3 production was significantly limited in the active RA group as compared with the inactive RA group and healthy controls (percentage decrease: active RA, 2.9 \u00b1 14.4%; inactive RA, 45.6 \u00b1 14.4%; controls, 65.8 \u00b1 7.9%) (Fig. 2b). As a consequence, CD4+ T cells from active RA patients produced higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 than did normal CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2a).\nIn addition, we compared IL-2 production by CD4+ T cells after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of IL-10 in active RA patients and in healthy controls. Similarly, IL-2 production was not affected by 1 ng/ml IL-10 in RA patients (percentage decrease, -2.1 \u00b1 13.8%), while it was significantly reduced in healthy controls (61.1 \u00b1 13.7%; P \u003C 0.05). Taken together, these results indicate that RA CD4+ T cells become less susceptible to the immunoregulatory effect of IL-10 during the active phase.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":19},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":34,"end":39},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":57,"end":60},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":74,"end":78},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":175,"end":180},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":231,"end":235},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":349,"end":352},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":365,"end":370},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":384,"end":387},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":500,"end":503},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":522,"end":526},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":578,"end":583},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":602,"end":607},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":662,"end":667},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":699,"end":702},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":769,"end":774},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":788,"end":791},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":845,"end":850},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":878,"end":883},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":932,"end":937},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":999,"end":1004},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1019,"end":1022},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1038,"end":1041},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1046,"end":1050},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1092,"end":1097},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1327,"end":1332},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1352,"end":1357},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1423,"end":1428},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1432,"end":1437},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1683,"end":1686},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1746,"end":1751},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1779,"end":1784},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1801,"end":1804},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1850,"end":1854},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1869,"end":1872},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1896,"end":1900},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1934,"end":1939},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1998,"end":2002},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":2042,"end":2047},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":2228,"end":2231},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":2299,"end":2304},"obj":"Protein"}]}
