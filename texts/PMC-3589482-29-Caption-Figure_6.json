(B) Endogenous SerpinB2 expression is abrogated in C/EBP-\u03b2-deficient inflammatory macrophages. Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (TG macs) were infected with human and murine specific lentiviral shRNAs. Human CEBPB shRNA serves as the non-silencing control since it does not target the murine Cebpb sequence [38]. Lentiviral transduced macrophages were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 hrs. Left: Western blot analysis shows effective knockdown of endogenous C/EBP-\u03b2 following infection with murine Cebpb shRNA and not human CEBPB shRNA. Right: qPCR analysis of murine SerpinB2 mRNA expression in the lentiviral transduced peritoneal macrophages. The results represent the mean and SEM of two independent experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate.
