Western Blot\nTo obtain total protein lysates, cells were homogenized in RIPA buffer (1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1\u2009mM EGTA, 1\u2009mM Na3VO4, 20\u2009mM NaF, 0.5\u2009mM DTT, 1\u2009mM PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail in PBS pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 12,000\u2009g for 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Protein concentrations were estimated by Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce, IL, USA). Fifty micrograms of the resulting cytosolic protein extracts were heat-denatured in Laemmli sample loading buffer, separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in saline buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C, and the following antibodies were used: anti-\u03b2-actin (sc-130657, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA, 43\u2009kDa) and anti-matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) (sc-6841, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA, 92\u2009kDa). Each primary antibody was diluted appropriately in blocking buffer and then added to the blots for 1\u2009h at room temperature. The blots were washed three times in the washing buffer and covered with the horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody at a 1\u2009:\u20092000 dilution for 1\u2009h. Blots were incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Bucks, UK) and exposed to radiographic film (Fuji Hyperfilm, Tokyo, Japan). ImageJ was used to analyze the intensity of the blots. The level of \u03b2-actin was used as internal standard.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":883,"end":887},"obj":"Protein"}]}
