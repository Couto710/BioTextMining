Employing a comprehensive methodological approach, the aim of our in vitro study was to elucidate novel molecular and cellular mechanisms of human peripheral blood immune cells mediated by a fungal \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucan, i.e. glucan phosphate, in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1).\nResults\nDespite an activation of nuclear factor (NF)\u03baB, NFinterleukin(IL)-6 and NFAT similar to LPS or TSST-1, we observed no significant production of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 or interferon \u03b3 induced by glucan phosphate. Glucan phosphate-treated leukocytes induced a substantial amount of IL-8 (peak at 18 h: 5000 pg/ml), likely due to binding of NF\u03baB to a consensus site in the IL-8 promoter. An increase in IL-1receptor antagonist(RA) production (peak at 24 h: 12000 pg/ml) by glucan phosphate-treated cells positively correlated with IL-8 levels. Glucan phosphate induced significant binding to a known NFIL-6 site and a new NFAT site within the IL-1RA promoter, which was confirmed by inhibition experiments. When applied in combination with either LPS or TSST-1 at the same time points, we detected that glucan phosphate elevated the LPS- and the TSST-1-induced DNA binding of NF\u03baB, NFIL-6 and NFAT, leading to a synergistic increase of IL-1RA. Further, glucan phosphate modulated the TSST-1-induced inflammatory response via reduction of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. As a consequence, glucan phosphate shifted the TSST-1-induced IL-1\u03b2/IL-1RA ratio towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Subsequently, glucan phosphate decreased the TSST-1-induced, IL-1-dependent production of IL-2.\nConclusion\nThus, \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucans may induce beneficial effects in the presence of pro-inflammatory responses, downstream of receptor binding and signaling by switching a pro- to an anti-inflammatory IL-1RA-mediated reaction. Our results also offer new insights into the complex regulation of the IL-1RA gene, which can be modulated by a \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucan.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":70,"end":74},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":120,"end":125},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":126,"end":150},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":563,"end":591},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":593,"end":599},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":658,"end":677},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":682,"end":686},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":705,"end":711},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":754,"end":759},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":761,"end":765},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":767,"end":790},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":794,"end":806},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":904,"end":908},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":994,"end":998},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1024,"end":1047},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1048,"end":1050},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1152,"end":1156},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1264,"end":1270},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1375,"end":1381},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1467,"end":1473},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1503,"end":1509},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1514,"end":1518},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1557,"end":1563},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1605,"end":1611},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1659,"end":1664},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1669,"end":1673},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1722,"end":1728},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1737,"end":1742},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1743,"end":1749},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1841,"end":1847},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1857,"end":1861},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1886,"end":1890},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2091,"end":2097},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2188,"end":2194},"obj":"Protein"}]}
