Membranes were subsequently blocked with 5% milk in PBS-T (1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20), and incubated with primary antibodies overnight. Affinity purified rabbit anti-mouse SerpinB2 antibodies were prepared after immunization with a purified recombinant GST-murine SerpinB2 fusion protein produced in E. coli as in [35]. Other antibodies used for western blot assays include: C/EBP-\u03b2 (sc-150) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and \u03b1/\u03b2 tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":504,"end":538},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":626,"end":633},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":673,"end":713},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":715,"end":720},"obj":"Protein"}]}
