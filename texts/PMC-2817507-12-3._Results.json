Activation of TLR4-Mediated NF-Kappa-B Signaling\nActivation of TLR4 induces the phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa-B (I\u03baB), which dissociates I\u03baB with NF-kappa-B (NF\u03baB). Then, NF\u03baB translocates into the nucleus and activates and regulates the transcription of genes related to inflammatory responses. To detectd the activation of TLR4-mediated NF\u03baB signaling, the phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa-B (p-I\u03baB) and activity of NF\u03baB were measured by methods of Western Blots and EMSA. Results showed that the p-I\u03baB increased at 6\u2009hours after ICH (P \u003C .05), peaked on 3 days after ICH, and maintained a high level on 7 days after ICH (P \u003C .05, Figure 5). As expected, the activity of NF\u03baB was also increased in the same manner as that of the p-I\u03baB (Figure 4).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":19,"end":23},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":68,"end":72},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":338,"end":342},"obj":"Protein"}]}
