(A) qPCR analysis of murine SerpinB2 mRNA levels, relative to \u03b2-actin. The plot is representative of at least two independent experiments performed in triplicate. (B) Immunoblot analysis of SerpinB2 protein expression in whole cell lysates. Blot was reprobed for GAPDH as a loading control.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":17,"end":25},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":188,"end":196},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":222,"end":229},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":350,"end":358},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":423,"end":428},"obj":"Protein"}]}
