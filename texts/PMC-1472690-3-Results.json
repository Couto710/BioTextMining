Previous studies reported that \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucans induced only a limited cytokine secretion of human blood cells [15-18]. Corroborating and extending these singular findings in terms of examining pro- (eight) as well as anti- (three) inflammatory cytokines over time (48 h) and six additional transcription factor binding sites, our comprehensive analysis revealed the following cytokine profile of human leukocytes in response to a highly purified water soluble \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucan and in comparison to two pro-inflammatory mediators (LPS, TSST-1):\n(i) IL-1\u03b2\nThere was no IL-1\u03b2 production detectable following PBMC treatment with 1 nor 100 \u03bcg GP. An insignificant up-regulation of IL-1\u03b2 production for GP + LPS was observed in comparison with LPS. For GP + TSST-1 we found a significant reduction in IL-1\u03b2 from 18 h \u2013 24 h, for the latter by about 40% when compared to TSST-1 or the theoretical value of GP/TSST-1 calc. (n = 6; both p = 0.01). On the whole, GP mediated a reduction of the TSST-1-induced amount of IL-1\u03b2 by about 50% (Fig. 3A).\n(ii) IL-6\nGP induced only a small amount of IL-6 and there was no significant alteration of the LPS-induced IL-6 production by GP. On the contrary, we observed a decreased IL-6 production for GP + TSST-1 when compared to TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc., especially at 24 h by about 40% (n = 5; both p = 0.02), (data not shown in detail).\n(iii) IL-8\nWe found that GP induced a substantial IL-8 production, in comparison with medium control, especially at 24 h (n = 13; p \u003C 0.01). A combination of GP and LPS resulted in a non-significant increase of IL-8 production when compared to LPS or GP/LPS calc. There was no significant alteration in IL-8 production following GP + TSST-1 when compared to TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc. (data not shown in detail).\n(iv) IL-1RA\nBesides IL-8, IL-1RA was the only mediator which was produced in significant quantities following GP treatment, especially at 24 h (n = 14, p \u003C 0.01). When compared to LPS stimulation or GP/LPS calc., GP + LPS did not alter the kinetic course of the IL-1RA production. However, following GP + TSST-1 we found a synergistic increase in IL-1RA production from 18 h to 48 h, when compared to TSST-1 (for instance at 24 h: n = 6; p = 0.01) or to the theoretical value of GP/TSST-1 calc. (from 18 h to 36 h). Over the time course of 48 h, GP elevated the TSST-1-induced amount of IL-1RA by approximately 200% (Fig. 3B).\nPositive correlation between GP-induced IL-8 and IL-1RA productions. Following stimulation with GP (24 h), we observed a positive correlation between IL-8 and IL-1RA. Moreover, we found this correlation to be dose-dependent, since 100 \u03bcg of GP induced larger amounts of IL-8 and IL-1RA than 1 \u03bcg GP (n = 5, p \u2264 0.002, r = 0.9 and 0.98, respectively).\n(v) TNF\u03b1\nWith respect to TNF\u03b1 production, 100 \u03bcg of GP yielded minor, statistically not distinguishable amounts, when compared to medium control. GP + LPS did not change the TNF\u03b1 production when compared to LPS supplementation or GP/LPS calc. When combined with TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc., GP seemed to exert a synergistic effect on TNF\u03b1 secretion after 36 h (n = 3; p \u003C 0.05), but overall an enhancement of only 10% was observed (p \u003E 0.05; data not shown in detail).\n(vi) IFN\u03b3\nNo IFN\u03b3 production was detectable following treatment of PBMC with 100 \u03bcg GP. There was a minor increase in IFN\u03b3 production following GP + LPS at 36 h, when compared to LPS or GP/LPS calc., and a slight down-regulation following GP + TSST-1 at 24 h and 36 h, when compared to TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc. (data not shown).\n(vii) IL-2, IL-12, IL-4, IL-10, TGF\u03b21\nThe production of IL-2, IL-12, IL-4, IL-10 and TGF\u03b2 1 was not induced by GP. There were also no significant differences between medium control, LPS, TSST-1, GP, GP + LPS, GP/LPS calc. and GP + TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc. over 48 h (data not shown).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":79,"end":85},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":109,"end":115},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":178,"end":182},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":184,"end":188},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":190,"end":194},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":199,"end":203},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":295,"end":299},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":301,"end":305},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":307,"end":311},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":313,"end":317},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":889,"end":895},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":902,"end":907},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":921,"end":926},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1030,"end":1035},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1106,"end":1112},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1149,"end":1154},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1218,"end":1224},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1256,"end":1262},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1338,"end":1344},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1363,"end":1368},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1398,"end":1402},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1437,"end":1441},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1501,"end":1505},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1565,"end":1569},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1590,"end":1596},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1614,"end":1620},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1627,"end":1633},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1731,"end":1735},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1775,"end":1779},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1936,"end":1940},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2028,"end":2032},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2059,"end":2065},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2083,"end":2089},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2096,"end":2102},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2142,"end":2148},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2157,"end":2161},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":2163,"end":2169},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":2399,"end":2405},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":2442,"end":2448},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":2484,"end":2490},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":2538,"end":2544},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":2619,"end":2625},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":2699,"end":2705},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":2724,"end":2730},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":2804,"end":2808},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":2813,"end":2819},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":2914,"end":2918},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":2923,"end":2929},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":3034,"end":3038},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":3043,"end":3049},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":3119,"end":3123},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":3140,"end":3144},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":3289,"end":3293},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":3377,"end":3383},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":3390,"end":3396},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":3447,"end":3451},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T57","span":{"begin":3587,"end":3591},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T58","span":{"begin":3595,"end":3599},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":3700,"end":3704},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T60","span":{"begin":3826,"end":3832},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T61","span":{"begin":3868,"end":3874},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":3881,"end":3887},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T63","span":{"begin":3918,"end":3922},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":3924,"end":3929},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T65","span":{"begin":3931,"end":3935},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T66","span":{"begin":3937,"end":3942},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T67","span":{"begin":3944,"end":3949},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T68","span":{"begin":3968,"end":3972},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T69","span":{"begin":3974,"end":3979},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T70","span":{"begin":3981,"end":3985},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T71","span":{"begin":3987,"end":3992},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T72","span":{"begin":3997,"end":4003},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T73","span":{"begin":4099,"end":4105},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T74","span":{"begin":4143,"end":4149},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T75","span":{"begin":4156,"end":4162},"obj":"Protein"}]}
