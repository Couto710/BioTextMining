These \u03b2-1\u21923-D-linked glucose polymers are characterized as a fungal pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) [2]. The primary cellular recognition of \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucans is mediated by several \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucan receptors on phagocytes [3,4] and other cells [5,6]. Human as well as murine Dectin-1 has been demonstrated to be the major pattern recognition receptor (PRR) for intact yeast and \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucan-containing particles (i.e. zymosan) on monocytes/macrophages as well as neutrophils and on primary cells [7-11]. In the murine system, binding of zymosan to Dectin-1 resulted in production of TNF\u03b1 through Toll-like receptor 2 and the adaptor protein MyD88 [12]. Another water-soluble \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucan (PGG-glucan) has been described to activate NF\u03baB and NFIL-6 in murine cell lines [13,14]. Similarly, it has been shown that \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucans activate NF\u03baB in a human monocyte-like cell line [15] and in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), in the latter case without secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF\u03b1) [16]. One study proposed that the production of the anti-inflammatory IL-1RA, but not IL-1 by human monocytes may be a potentially protective mechanism induced by \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucan [17]. Three other investigations have reported that human leukocytes and human vascular endothelial cells produce IL-8 in response to zymosan [18] or a water-soluble \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucan [6,19].\nIn addition, \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucans seem to be able to modify the response to pro-inflammatory stimuli or even sepsis. In a murine polymicrobial sepsis model, \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucan [20] treatment resulted in decreased septic morbidity and mortality mediated via inhibition of NF\u03baB and stimulation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway [21,22]. These and other animal studies [23,24] as well as a clinical trial [25] support a protective role of \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucan in certain pro-inflammatory conditions. The mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects of \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucan are only partially resolved, especially in humans. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms of \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucans on human leukocytes in pro-inflammatory conditions with special emphasis on the cytokine profile and its transcriptional regulation. For this purpose, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were exposed to a well-defined \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucan, i.e. glucan phosphate (GP) [20,26], alone or simultaneously with LPS from gram-negative bacteria or the superantigen TSST-1 from gram-positive bacteria over 48 h. Because of the potential effect of \u03b2-1\u21923-D-glucan on cytokine production [12,16-19], TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1RA were measured as well as IFN\u03b3, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and TGF\u03b21. Correspondingly, four NF\u03baB sites from the TNF\u03b1 promoter (\u03ba consensus, \u03ba1, \u03ba2, \u03ba3) [27], a \u03ba consensus site from the IL-8 promoter [28], an NFAT site from the IFN\u03b3 promoter (ATP2) [29] and a consensus NFIL-6 site from the IL-6 promoter [13] were examined. Because of the anti-inflammatory role of IL-1RA, we focused on binding of transcription factors to the IL-1RA promoter. An inhibitory element and three positive-acting LPS-response elements (LRE-1, LRE-2 and LRE-3) in the IL-1RA promoter, including NF\u03baB, PU.1 and NFIL-6 sites, have been characterized previously [30-33]. Using computational analysis for homology search [34], we looked for new binding motifs in the IL-1RA promoter.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":464,"end":472},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":739,"end":747},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":774,"end":778},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":787,"end":807},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":832,"end":837},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":934,"end":940},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1193,"end":1197},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1199,"end":1203},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1205,"end":1209},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1281,"end":1287},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1297,"end":1301},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1503,"end":1507},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":2649,"end":2655},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":2780,"end":2784},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":2786,"end":2791},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":2793,"end":2797},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":2799,"end":2803},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":2808,"end":2814},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":2840,"end":2844},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":2846,"end":2850},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":2852,"end":2856},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":2858,"end":2863},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":2865,"end":2870},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2875,"end":2880},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2924,"end":2928},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2998,"end":3002},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":3040,"end":3044},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":3103,"end":3107},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":3178,"end":3184},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":3240,"end":3246},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":3359,"end":3365},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":3554,"end":3560},"obj":"Protein"}]}
