Cells employ a multilayered control system to keep NF-\u03baB signalling in check, including a repertoire of negative feedback regulators ensuring termination of NF-\u03baB responses. Here we will review various negative regulatory mechanisms that have evolved to control NF-\u03baB signalling and which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins"}
