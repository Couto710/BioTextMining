B16-F0 melanoma cells were inoculated subcutaneously into CCR5+/+ and CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice (n\u200a=\u200a20). Tumor growth was monitored for 31 days. Tumor growth in the CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice was significantly lower than that in the CCR5+/+ mice. The tumor growth in the CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice was reduced to 19.1%, whereas the tumor growth in the CCR5+/+ mice was only reduced to 24.3%, in both tumor weight (Figure 1A and 1B) and tumor volume, respectively (Figure 1A and 1C). These results correlated with mice survival rates. There was a significant difference in survival rates between CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice (75% of starting time) and CCR5+/+ mice (15%) at the end of the experiment (Figure 1D). There was a significant difference in survival rates between CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice and CCR5+/+ mice. At the end of the experiment, 75% of the CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice survived while only 15% of the CCR5+/+ mice survived. Subcutaneous tumors were harvested from the sacrificed mice 31 days after inoculation. The immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections, stained with H\u0026E and for proliferation antigen PCNA, revealed greater inhibition of tumor cell growth in CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice. The histologic findings after H\u0026E staining indicated that the tumor tissues of the CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice, but not those of the CCR5+/+ mice, contained large areas of necrosis. PCNA reactive cells were significantly reduced in the CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 1E).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":35,"end":39},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":62,"end":66},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":111,"end":115},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":123,"end":127},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":195,"end":199},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":207,"end":211},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":290,"end":294},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":344,"end":348},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":382,"end":386},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":449,"end":453},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":692,"end":696},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":732,"end":736},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":854,"end":858},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":871,"end":875},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":926,"end":930},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":970,"end":974},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1237,"end":1241},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1334,"end":1338},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1369,"end":1373},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1472,"end":1476},"obj":"Protein"}]}
