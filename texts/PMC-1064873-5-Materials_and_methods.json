PBMC were incubated with saturating concentrations of anti-IL-10R1 mAb (IgG1; R\u0026D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or with isotype-matched control mAb (Immunotech), followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Cells were then incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb (Becton Dickinson). Cells were washed well with 1% FCS/PBS between incubations. Analysis was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":29,"end":36},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":177,"end":184},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":478,"end":481},"obj":"Protein"}]}
