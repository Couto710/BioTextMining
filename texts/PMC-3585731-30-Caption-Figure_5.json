(B) Cell under serum free condition were treated with bFGF or bFGF/zVAD.fmk for the indicated amounts of time, followed by western blotting using the indicated antibodies. (C) Necroptosis was induced by zVAD.fmk or TNF\u03b1 in L929 cell in the presence of inhibitors of Akt(Akt inh. VIII) and mTOR (rapamycin, Torin-1 and PI-103). (D) L929 cells with mTOR siRNA knockdown were harvested for western blot or treated with zVAD.fmk or TNF\u03b1 for 24 hrs. Cell viability was determined 24 hr after activation of necroptosis. In all graphs, average\u00b1SD was plotted.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":98,"end":102},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":198,"end":202},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":206,"end":210},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":359,"end":363},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":572,"end":576},"obj":"Protein"}]}
