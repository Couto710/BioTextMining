Human PBMC were incubated with medium control or GP (1 and 100 \u03bcg) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Nuclear extracts were incubated with a 32P-labeled NFAT, NF\u03baB, NFIL-6 or NF\u03baB-IL-8 oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8 gene promoters (Table 1). Arrows with the black head indicate migrational location of the NFAT-DNA, NF\u03baB-DNA, NFIL-6-DNA or NF\u03baB-IL-8-DNA complex compared to free probe (no shift). Arrow with the open head indicates a supershift of NF\u03baB-IL-8-DNA-anti-p65 and -p50, respectively. An autoradiogram from a representative experiment is shown (n = 7). B, Decreased DNA binding of NF\u03baB following GP + TSST-1, compared to TSST-1, GP, or TSST-1/GP. Human PBMC were incubated with medium control, LPS, TSST-1, GP (100 \u03bcg), GP + TSST-1 and GP + LPS for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. An autoradiogram from a representative experiment is shown. Schematic representation of NF\u03baB-DNA binding activity following GP (1 and 100 \u03bcg) or TSST-1 treatment (250 ng) as well as simultaneous administration of both compounds and the theoretical value (GP/TSST-1 calc.). Medium control levels were set equal to 1\u00b1 SEM and significances (* = p \u003C 0.05) are shown with respect to medium control (n = 4).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":32},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":43,"end":49},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":186,"end":190},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":198,"end":204},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":213,"end":217},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":261,"end":265},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":267,"end":271},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":273,"end":277},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":282,"end":286},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":377,"end":381},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":397,"end":403},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":416,"end":420},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":524,"end":528},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":538,"end":541},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":547,"end":550},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":682,"end":688},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":702,"end":708},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":717,"end":723},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":780,"end":786},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":806,"end":812},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":988,"end":994},"obj":"Protein"}]}
