Cell viability was determined after 24 hrs. (C) L929 cells transfected with Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 siRNAs for 72 hrs were treated with zVAD.fmk or TNF\u03b1 for 9 hrs. Cell viability and Akt expression levels were determined after 24 hrs. In all graphs, average\u00b1SD was plotted.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":55,"end":59},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":106,"end":110},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":354,"end":358},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":360,"end":364},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":370,"end":381},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":423,"end":427},"obj":"Protein"}]}
