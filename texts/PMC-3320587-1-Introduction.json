Direct engagement of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) by MTb on mononuclear phagocytes activates signaling cascades that directly induce transcription from the proviral LTR (reviewed in [3]). Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines produced by the human host in response to MTb infection activate signal transduction pathways in CD4 T cells and monocytic cells that also result in transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR [4]\u2013[6]. Activation of HIV-1 replication via these MTb-induced pathways ultimately leads to higher viral loads and, in turn, expedited CD4 T cell loss and progression to AIDS ([7], reviewed in [8]\u2013[10]). Furthermore, the progressive immune compromise associated with HIV-1 infection itself is a major cause of latent MTb reactivation, as well as increased susceptibility to primary TB infection ([11]\u2013[15], reviewed in [8]).\nThe primary PRR on monocytic cells triggered by MTb infection is toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 [16]\u2013[20]. Engagement of TLR2 results in engagement of the adaptor protein MyD88 and the subsequent recruitment of several kinases, including IRAK1 and IRAK4, and the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 ([21]\u2013[23], reviewed in [10], [24]). TRAF6 activates I\u03baB kinase (IKK) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases that, in turn, ultimately induce activation of specific transcription factor families, including the NF-\u03baB and AP-1 families, which have been shown to associate with the HIV-1 LTR and to drive its transcription ([22], [25]\u2013[27], reviewed in [10]).\nNotably, HIV-1 comprises several subtypes, and the LTR of each subtype is unique with respect to the number and organization of activator binding sites. For example, HIV-1 subtype B, the most highly characterized viral subtype and the primary cause of infection in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Australia, has two tandem NF-\u03baB motifs in its LTR. By contrast, HIV-1 subtypes C and E, which have spread disproportionately in TB-burdened sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, have three and one NF-\u03baB binding sites, respectively [1], [28]\u2013[30].\nWe previously showed that the most primordial member of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family, NFAT5 (also known as TonEBP), binds to a site within the HIV-1 LTR that is highly conserved across all HIV-1 subtypes, and is also conserved in HIV-2 and SIV LTRs. This NFAT5 site overlaps the core NF-\u03baB binding motifs in the LTR and is required for constitutive replication of representative HIV-1 subtype B, C, and E isolates in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) [31]. Given that NFAT5 has previously been shown to be transcriptionally activated by the MAP kinase p38, which is downstream of MyD88 signaling, [32], we speculated that NFAT5 may also be involved in MTb-induced activation of HIV-1 replication via a TLR-mediated pathway in monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).\nHere, we show that NFAT5 and its cognate binding site are of crucial importance for efficient MTb-induced stimulation of HIV-1 replication in human MDM and PBMC. Moreover, we demonstrate that MTb infection increases NFAT5 gene expression in human monocytes in a MyD88-dependent manner. Thus, these results expand the known stimuli of NFAT5 expression to the PRR-mediated innate immune response, and demonstrate that NFAT5 is a critical modulator of MTb-induced enhancement of HIV-1 replication.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":552,"end":555},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":783,"end":786},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1138,"end":1164},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1190,"end":1194},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1240,"end":1245},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1307,"end":1312},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1317,"end":1322},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1349,"end":1354},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1392,"end":1397},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":2374,"end":2379},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":2395,"end":2401},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":2771,"end":2776},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":2883,"end":2888},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":2925,"end":2930},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":3105,"end":3110},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":3302,"end":3307},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":3348,"end":3353},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":3420,"end":3425},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":3502,"end":3507},"obj":"Protein"}]}
