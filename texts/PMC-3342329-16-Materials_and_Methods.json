The samples were frozen at \u221270\u00b0C, thawed, and centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7g for 5 min to remove cellular debris. The tissue lysates were performed protein assay in the same way as for western blotting. 4.5 mg of proteins, collected from three samples per group, were used for Mouse cytokine array as the protocol provided by supplier (Proteome Profiler\u2122, #ARY006, R\u0026D Systems, USA).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins"}
