Therefore, we determined that 3 days after SE was the best time point to evaluate the effect of sTNFp55R infusion on both vasogenic edema and neuronal damages induced by SE. In saline-treated animals, the PC was stained diffusely with anti-rat IgG (Figure 2A). The volume of vasogenic edema was 17.1 \u00b1 1.5 mm3 (Figure 2E). The number of FJB-positive neurons in the PC was 236,145 \u00b1 49,469 (Figure 2B). In sTNFp55R-treated animals, SE-induced vasogenic edema was attenuated to 9.8 \u00b1 0.7 mm3 (Figures 2C and 2E). In addition, the number of FJB-positive neurons in the PC was 89,138 \u00b1 5,698 (Figures 2D-E). Thus, sTNFp55R infusion attenuated SE-induced vasogenic edema and neuronal damage compared to saline-infused animals (p \u003C 0.05).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":11,"end":18},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":332,"end":339},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":641,"end":648},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":846,"end":853},"obj":"Protein"}]}
