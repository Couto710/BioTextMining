Cell Death Measurement by CCK-8 Assay\n1 \u00d7 103/well cells were seeded to 96-well culture plates and cultivated for 24\u2009h to adhere. Then the cell was scrated as mentioned above. Astrocyte cell death was assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo, Japan) assay 24\u2009h after scratch according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 10\u2009\u03bcL CCK-8 was added into every well and incubated for 1\u2009h. Then OD value was read at 450\u2009nm using a Bio-Rad ELISA microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA). All measurements were performed in sextuplicate. Results were expressed as mean of OD value at 450\u2009nm \u00b1 SD.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins"}
