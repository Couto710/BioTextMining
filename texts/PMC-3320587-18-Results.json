This series of experiments also allowed us to dissect the relative importance of NFAT5 and NF-\u03baB binding to the HIV-1 LTR in MTb regulation of HIV-1 replication.\nTo perform these experiments, we constructed a panel of infectious HIV-1Lai/Bal-env molecular clones where either the NFAT5 site was specifically disrupted or the two NF-\u03baB binding sites were either individually or dually disrupted (Figure 3A). Specifically, we constructed a clone in which the NFAT5 binding site was mutated (named HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut) by changing the CC dinucleotide to TT in the core NFAT5 binding site and introduced substitution mutations into the NF-\u03baB/NFAT5 shared binding element that we predicted would disrupt NF-\u03baB binding but preserve NFAT5 binding. Specifically, we mutated two guanines (GG) in the \u03baB I site and changed them to thymine and adenine (TA) (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-\u03baB I-mut) and also introduced the same GG to TA change in the second, more distal NF-\u03baB site (\u03baB II) in HIV-1Lai/Bal-env (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-\u03baB II-Mut). We also created a double NF-\u03baB site mutant virus (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-\u03baB I+II-Mut) in order to test the impact of complete disruption of NF-\u03baB binding to the HIV-1 LTR on MTb regulation.\nTo determine the specificity of these substitutions upon NFAT5 and NF-\u03baB p50/p65 binding to the LTR, we performed a quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis using the wild-type LTR or mutant LTRs in combination with increasing concentrations of recombinant NFAT5 or NF-\u03baB p50/p65 proteins. As shown in Figure 3B, the N5-Mut LTR could not bind NFAT5 (compare lanes 12\u201315 and lanes 17\u201320), but p50/p65 binding was not impaired (compare lanes 2\u20135 with lanes 7\u201310). By contrast, changing the GG dinucleotide to TA in either NF-\u03baB binding motif, as predicted, inhibited p50/p65 binding at each site (compare lanes 2\u20135 with lanes 7\u201310 and lanes 12\u201315 of Figure 3C). As expected, mutation of both NF-\u03baB sites (\u03baB I+II-Mut) resulted in abrogation of p50/p65 binding to the LTR. However, recombinant NFAT5 binding to the single and the double NF-\u03baB mutant LTRs was not impaired and indeed appeared enhanced (compare lanes 2\u20135 to lanes 7\u201320 of Figure 3D). Thus, binding of NFAT5 or NF-\u03baB p50/p65 to their respective motifs can be specifically disrupted within an overlapping or shared binding site.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":15},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":105,"end":110},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":210,"end":215},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":259,"end":264},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":306,"end":311},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":460,"end":465},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":621,"end":624},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":887,"end":890},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1109,"end":1114},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1243,"end":1246},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1364,"end":1367},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1382,"end":1385},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1461,"end":1464},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1639,"end":1644},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1655,"end":1658},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1659,"end":1662},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1711,"end":1718},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1841,"end":1846},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1856,"end":1859},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1860,"end":1863},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1927,"end":1932},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1976,"end":1979},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1980,"end":1983},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2149,"end":2152},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2153,"end":2156},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2326,"end":2329},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2330,"end":2333},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2375,"end":2380},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2547,"end":2552},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2562,"end":2565},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2566,"end":2569},"obj":"Protein"}]}
