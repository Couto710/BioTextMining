(A-B) Inhibition of p65-Thr435 phosphorylation by sTNFp55R infusion 12 hr after SE. p65-Thr435 phosphorylation is rarely observed in astrocytes (arrows). (C) Endothelial p65-Thr435 phosphorylation in non-SE animals. (D-E) Endothelial p65-Thr435 phosphorylation in saline-infused animals 1 day after SE. p65-Thr435 phosphorylation is enhanced, while SMI-71 expression is reduced in GLUT-1-positive endothelial cells (arrows). (F-G) Endothelial p65-Thr435 phosphorylation in sTNFp55R-infused animal 1 day after SE. sTNFp55R infusion effectively reduces p65-Thr435 and preserves SMI-71 expression in GLUT-1-positive endothelial cells (arrows).
