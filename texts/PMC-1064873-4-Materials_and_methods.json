The cells were incubated with 1 \u03bcg/ml anti-CD28 mAb (Immunotech) in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of IL-10 (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 [28]. Culture supernatants were collected 36 hours later and cell-free samples were stored at -30\u00b0C until cytokine assay.\nTo examine the effect of IL-6 on T-cell responsiveness to IL-10, CD4+ T cells from healthy controls were incubated in culture medium with 10% FCS in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml IL-6 (Becton Dickinson) for 36 hours. Cells were then stimulated for 36 hours with anti-CD3 mAb and anti-CD28 mAb in the presence or absence of 1 ng/ml IL-10. Culture supernatants were measured for IFN-\u03b3 concentrations.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":11,"end":14},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":27,"end":30},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":338,"end":342},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":422,"end":427},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":666,"end":670},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":699,"end":704},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":706,"end":709},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":826,"end":830},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":931,"end":935},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":978,"end":983},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1024,"end":1029},"obj":"Protein"}]}
