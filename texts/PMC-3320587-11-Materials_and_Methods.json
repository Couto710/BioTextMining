Extracts were boiled for 5 min in 1\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer with 5% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose Trans-Blot Transfer Membrane (BioRad). The blot was then blocked for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a solution of 4% BSA (Sigma) and 0.1% Tween-20 (BioRad) in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.6 (BSA/TBST). Primary incubation was carried out with a1\u2236200 dilution of rabbit anti-NFAT5 antibody (H-300) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a 1\u2236500 dilution of goat anti-Lamin-B1 antibody (sc-6217; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in BSA/TBST for 2 h at room temperature. The blot was washed 3\u00d75 min in TBST and incubated in 1\u22366000 donkey anti-goat-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or goat anti-rabbit-HRP (BioRad) as appropriate for 1 h. The blot was again washed 3\u00d75 min in TBST and developed with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Reagent (Pierce).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":506,"end":509},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":829,"end":832},"obj":"Protein"}]}
