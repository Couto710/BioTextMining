We have also shown that upregulation of IL-17 by activated T cells in patients with RA could be the result of activation via the PI3K/Akt pathway with resultant NF-\u03baB activation. Our data provide insights into cellular mechanisms of the regulation of IL-17 production in RA, and highlight the role of T cells, which has hitherto been neglected in RA pathogenesis. Together with recent data on the successful introduction of anti-IL-17 in RA, our results have added information for the future molecular targeting of new therapeutic applications in RA.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":49,"end":54},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":83,"end":88},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":93,"end":98},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":139,"end":143},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":185,"end":190},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":279,"end":282},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":396,"end":401},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":574,"end":579},"obj":"Protein"}]}
