B16 melanoma cells (5\u00d7105 cells/mouse) were inoculated s.c. into CCR5+/+ mice and CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice (n\u200a=\u200a20). Tumor volumes were measured every day and tumor weights were measured at study termination (Day 31). The CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice had a significant reduction in tumor growth and volume as compared to CCR5+/+ mice. The results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. * indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (P\u003C0.05). D, The CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated significantly higher survival rates compared to CCR5+/+ mice (by Log-rank Test). E. Tumor sections were analyzed by H\u0026E stain and expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) by immunohistochemistry. Data are means \u00b1 S.D. of four experimental animals. * indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (P\u003C0.05). Scale bar indicates 50 m.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":35,"end":39},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":155,"end":159},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":172,"end":176},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":300,"end":304},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":383,"end":387},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":477,"end":481},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":507,"end":511},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":581,"end":585},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":836,"end":840},"obj":"Protein"}]}
