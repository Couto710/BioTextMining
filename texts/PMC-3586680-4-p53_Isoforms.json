{"target":"http://pubannotation.org/docs/sourcedb/PMC/sourceid/3586680/divs/4","sourcedb":"PMC","sourceid":"3586680","divid":4,"text":"At least nine isoforms of p53 have been identified due to alternative mRNA splicing, multiple gene promoters, and alternative initiation sites of translation (Ghosh et al., 2004; Ray et al., 2006; Figure 2). In cancers, aberrant expression of p53 isoforms occurs frequently (Bourdon et al., 2005; Bourdon, 2007). Full-length p53, \u0394133p53, and p53\u03b2 are localized mainly in the nucleus, and only few of them are in cytoplasm. p53\u03b3 and \u0394133p53\u03b2 are localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. \u0394133p53\u03b3 is localized in the cytoplasm (Bourdon et al., 2005). Co-transfection of p53 and p53\u03b2 increases p53-mediated apoptosis, whereas co-expression of p53 with \u0394133p53 suppresses p53-mediated apoptosis (Bourdon et al., 2005). \u0394133p53 differentially regulates gene expression in p53-dependent and -independent manners (Aoubala et al., 2011). Co-expression of \u0394133p53\u03b2 or \u0394133p53\u03b3 with p53 does not affect p53 transcriptional activity on p21 and Bax promoters, as well as apoptosis.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":26,"end":29},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":243,"end":246},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":325,"end":328},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":330,"end":337},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":343,"end":347},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":424,"end":428},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":433,"end":441},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":486,"end":494},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":568,"end":571},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":576,"end":580},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":591,"end":594},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":640,"end":643},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":649,"end":656},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":668,"end":671},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":715,"end":722},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":767,"end":770},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":847,"end":855},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":859,"end":867},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":873,"end":876},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":893,"end":896},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":925,"end":928},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":933,"end":936},"obj":"Protein"}]}
