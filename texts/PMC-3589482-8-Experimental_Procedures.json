Because the human and mouse cebpb 3\u2032 untranslated regions are not identical, these species-specific shRNAs cannot knockdown expression of endogenous C/EBP-\u03b2 when used on cells of the other species; therefore we used the human CEBPB shRNA as a control in these experiments as in [38]. To produce lentiviral particles, HEK-293T cells were transfected with a mixture of plasmids: each shRNA expression plasmid (1 \u00b5g), pCMV-\u0394R8.2dvpr packaging plasmid (0.75 \u00b5g), and pCMV-VSV-G envelope plasmid (0.25 \u00b5g) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The lentiviral supernatant was collected 48 hrs after transfection, cleared by centrifugation at 2,000 g for 10 mins and passed through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter. The target cells were treated with the lentiviral supernatant and 8 \u00b5g/ml Polybrene (American Bioanalytical) for 24 hrs. The lentiviral supernatant was replaced with fresh growth media and incubated further for 72 hrs to allow for effective gene knockdown. C/EBP-\u03b2 knockdown was confirmed by western blot analysis.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":142,"end":147},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":204,"end":209},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":325,"end":332},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1135,"end":1142},"obj":"Protein"}]}
