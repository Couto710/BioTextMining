Apoptotic cell death in the tumor sections were evaluated in the CCR5+/+ and CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice that were inoculated with melanoma cells. TUNEL staining revealed a higher frequency of apoptotic cell death in the tumor tissues of the CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice than that of the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 3A). Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence showed that high levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax were found more frequently in the CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice than in the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 3B and 3C). Consistent with the immunohistochemical data, Western blot analysis of tumor proteins showed greater increased levels of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved PARP and Bax, whereas the levels of Bcl-2 and C-IAP1 were significantly decreased in CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice tissues (Figure 3D).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":97,"end":101},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":449,"end":453},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":461,"end":465},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":611,"end":615},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":641,"end":645},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":797,"end":801},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":822,"end":826},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1068,"end":1074},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1107,"end":1111},"obj":"Protein"}]}
