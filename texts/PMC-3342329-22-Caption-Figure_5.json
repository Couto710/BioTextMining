The images shown are representative of three separate experiments performed in triplicate. Scale bars indicate 50 \u00b5m (A) and 100 \u00b5m (B). C and D, Analysis of lymphocyte phenotypes. The tumor and spleen tissues were separated at study termination (Day 31). Flow cytometry analysis was performed using FACSAria flow cytometry, and represent data were shown. Data are means \u00b1 S.D. of four experimental animals.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":97,"end":101},"obj":"Protein"}]}
