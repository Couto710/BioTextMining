RT-PCR\nTotal RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen, CA, USA), and single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 2\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA with BU-Script RT-Kit (Biunique, Jiangsu, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was stored in \u221220\u00b0C. Reverse transcription was conducted with GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Table 1 shows the primers and PCR parameters. PCR products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. The intensity of the bands was analyzed by ImageJ program. The level of \u03b2-actin was used as an internal standard.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":557,"end":564},"obj":"Protein"}]}
