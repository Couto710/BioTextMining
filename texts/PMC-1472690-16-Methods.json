Band shifts were determined after 1 h incubation with GP as described before, including mutated oligos for NFIL-6 (TTA CAA CAG TGG ATT GCG ACA CTT AGT GGG) and NFATP2/3 (GGC GCA GAA AAG GTA AAA TAT TTA CTA TCT) binding sites within the IL-1RA promoter. PBMC RNA was isolated with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germany) and messenger RNA was transcribed into cDNA with Reactin Ready First Strand kit (Biomol) and analysed for IL-1RA and GAPDH transcripts by PCR with a HotStart \"sweet\" PCR mastermix (Biomol) (95\u00b0C, 30 sec, 55\u00b0C, 30 sec, 72\u00b0C, 30 sec, 25 cycles for IL-1RA and 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 50\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 45 sec, 25 cycles for GAPDH) following 18 h incubation with GP. IL-1RA protein was measured in the supernatant by ELISA after 24 h incubation with GP.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":105,"end":111},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":595,"end":601},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":648,"end":654},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":655,"end":656},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":724,"end":730},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":906,"end":912},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":917,"end":922},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1167,"end":1173},"obj":"Protein"}]}
