As described, a control for non-specific siRNA effects, we used an siRNA targeting the green fluorescent protein (GFP), 5\u2032- GGCTACGTCCAGGAGCGCACC-3\u2032. MDM were transfected in 6-well plates using 1 \u00b5M of the indicated siRNA in siPORT NeoFX transfection reagent (Ambion Inc., www.ambion.com), prepared as recommended by the manufacturer, in a final volume of 750 \u00b5l in Macrophage-SFM medium plus 5% heat-inactivated human AB serum. The cultures were left at 37\u00b0C overnight after which cells were washed and incubated in fresh medium. MDM were transfected two times for efficient knock down of NFAT5 expression before infection experiments were performed [31].","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":116,"end":121},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":269,"end":294},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":296,"end":299},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":772,"end":777},"obj":"Protein"}]}
