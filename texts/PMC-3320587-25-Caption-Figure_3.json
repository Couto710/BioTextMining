NF-\u03baB and NFAT5 binding site mutations were introduced into the LTR of the HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-wild type (WT) infectious molecular clone. The NF-\u03baB binding site mutants (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-\u03baB I-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-\u03baB II-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-\u03baB I+II-Mut), and NFAT5 binding site mutant (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut) are shown along with the HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-WT sequence. Mutations were introduced into the 3\u2032 LTR of the HIV-1Lai/Bal-env\u2013WT proviral sequence. (B) Specific mutation of the NFAT5 binding site abolishes NFAT5 binding to the viral LTR but does not affect NF-\u03baB p50/p65 binding to the overlapping NF-\u03baB binding site. Quantitative DNaseI footprinting analysis is shown using HIV-1 LTR fragments (-262 to +4 nt relative to the transcription start site) from HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-WT and HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut and increasing concentrations of recombinant NF-\u03baB (p50/p65) (25 ng, 100 ng, and 500 ng), or NFAT5 (10 ng, 50 ng, and 250 ng). The regions that are protected from DNase I cleavage by the binding of NF-\u03baB and NFAT5 are indicated with a bars. (C) Specific disruption of the HIV-1 subtype B NF-\u03baB binding sites effectively abrogates recombinant p50/p65 binding. Quantitative DNaseI footprinting analysis is shown of nucleotides \u2212262 to +4 from HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-WT, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-\u03baB I-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-\u03baB II-Mut, and HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-\u03baB I+II-Mut and increasing concentrations of recombinant NF-\u03baB (p50/p65) (25 ng, 100 ng, and 500 ng). The regions that are protected from DNase I cleavage by the binding of recombinant NF-\u03baB are indicated with a bars. (D) Specific disruption of the HIV-1 subtype B NF-\u03baB binding site does not inhibit but enhances NFAT5 binding to this region. Quantitative DNaseI footprinting analysis is shown of nucleotides \u2212262 to +4 from HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-WT, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-\u03baB I-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-\u03baB II-Mut, and HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-\u03baB I+II-Mut and increasing concentrations of recombinant NFAT5 (10 ng, 50 ng, and 250 ng). The regions that are protected from DNase I cleavage by the binding of recombinant NFAT5 are indicated with a bars.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":128,"end":131},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":248,"end":251},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":340,"end":343},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":367,"end":370},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":395,"end":398},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":457,"end":460},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":507,"end":510},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":586,"end":589},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":670,"end":675},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":727,"end":730},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":731,"end":734},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":795,"end":801},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":934,"end":937},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":958,"end":961},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1021,"end":1024},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1025,"end":1028},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1062,"end":1067},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1132,"end":1139},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1177,"end":1182},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1311,"end":1314},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1315,"end":1318},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1341,"end":1347},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1423,"end":1426},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1444,"end":1447},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1471,"end":1474},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1503,"end":1506},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1571,"end":1574},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1575,"end":1578},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1645,"end":1652},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1821,"end":1826},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1864,"end":1870},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1946,"end":1949},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1967,"end":1970},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1994,"end":1997},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2026,"end":2029},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2087,"end":2092},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":2157,"end":2164},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":2204,"end":2209},"obj":"Protein"}]}
