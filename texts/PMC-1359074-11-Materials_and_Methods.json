Embryos were fixed overnight by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm, and adhered to charge modified slides (VWR, West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States). Slides were processed for in situ hybridization as described [52] using in vitro transcribed RNA probes labeled with 33P. Darkfield and brightfield images were obtained with a Nikon Optiphot microscope (Nikon, Melville, New York, United States) and SPOT RT-Slider digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, Michigan, United States). Objectives used were 1\u00d7 (NA = 0.04) and 10\u00d7 (NA = 0.5). Images were processed, pseudocolored, and combined using Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, California, United States) software with Fovea Pro (Reindeer Graphics, Asheville, North Carolina, United States) plugins. Original images are available.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":64,"end":73},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":95,"end":106},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":138,"end":142},"obj":"Protein"}]}
