The mice were housed and bred under specific pathogen free conditions at the Laboratory Animal Research Center of Chungbuk National University, Korea. The mice (n\u200a=\u200a4/cage) were maintained in a room with a constant temperature of 22\u00b11\u00b0C, relative humidity of 55\u00b110%, and 12-h light/dark cycle, and fed standard rodent chow (Samyang, Korea) and purified tap water ad libitum. The CCR5+/+ mice (n\u200a=\u200a20) and CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice (n\u200a=\u200a20), that were used, had matched ages (10\u201311 weeks old) and weights (16\u201319 g). Control mice (B6129PF2/J) were F2 hybrid mice from the C57BL/6J-AW-J and 129P3/J parental strains. CCR5 mice (B6, 129P2-Ccr5tm1Kuz/J) have the entire coding region of the CCR5 gene deleted from the parental strains, B6;129P2-Ccr5tm1kuz and B6;129P2-Cmkbr5tm1Kuz.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":12,"end":16},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":28,"end":32},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":41,"end":45},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":56,"end":60},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":523,"end":527},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":549,"end":553},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":745,"end":749},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":817,"end":821},"obj":"Protein"}]}
