Murine SerpinB2 gene promoter activity measured in Cebpb+/+ and Cebpb\u2212/\u2212 MEFs expressing the pGLmP-539 SerpinB2 promoter-luciferase reporter in the presence or absence of LPS (100 ng/mL). Cells were co-transfected with the pGLmP-539 SerpinB2 promoter-luciferase reporter and \u03b2-galactosidase reporter plasmids, and luciferase units normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase activity. (B) C/EBP-\u03b2 gene schematic depicting gene structure and phospho-acceptor sites. (C) Phosphorylation of C/EBP-\u03b2 at Serine 64 negatively regulates LPS-stimulated SerpinB2 promoter activity. Cebpb\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding wild-type C/EBP-\u03b2 or the indicated C/EBP-\u03b2 phospho-acceptor mutants, along with the pGLmP-539 SerpinB2 promoter-luciferase reporter and \u03b2-galactosidase reporter plasmids, and stimulated with LPS for 4 hrs. Luciferase activity was quantified and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase activity. The western blot (below the graphs) confirms the expression of the respective C/EBP-\u03b2 phospho-acceptor mutants. The C/EBP-\u03b2T217A -transfected MEFs express both the 38 kDa and 35 kDa isoforms of C/EBP-\u03b2. The results represent the mean and SEM of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate.
