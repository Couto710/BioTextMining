The reporter constructs were then transiently transfected into sub-confluent RAW264.7 macrophages and assayed for luciferase activity in the presence and absence of LPS or PMA, for comparison. PMA-induced SerpinB2 gene regulation has been extensively studied in human macrophage cell lines [45]\u2013[47], and has been shown to occur through several proximal and distal AP-1 responsive elements [30]; [37]; [47]\u2013[51]. As shown in Fig. 2B, the SerpinB2 5\u2032 flanking region from \u22124480 to +92 directs both PMA- and LPS-inducible transcription, approximately 2-fold and 7-fold, respectively. Deletion of the murine SerpinB2 promoter from \u22121686 to \u22121341 increased LPS-inducibility to approximately 16-fold, indicating the presence of a silencer element in this region. Further deletion beyond \u2212539 abolished the LPS-response of the promoter, indicating the presence of an essential LPS response element in the region between \u2212539 and \u2212189; however, the response of the murine SerpinB2 promoter to PMA is less affected by this deletion. While deletion of the SerpinB2 promoter from \u2212189 to \u221287 eliminated the LPS response and marginally reduced the PMA response, the \u221287 murine SerpinB2 promoter construct was still partially responsive to PMA, indicating that cis-acting elements mediating the response of the murine SerpinB2 promoter to PMA also lie downstream of nucleotide \u221287.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":4,"end":12},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":162,"end":170},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":319,"end":329},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":482,"end":492},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":573,"end":581},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":806,"end":814},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":973,"end":981},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1333,"end":1341},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1415,"end":1423},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1534,"end":1542},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1674,"end":1682},"obj":"Protein"}]}
