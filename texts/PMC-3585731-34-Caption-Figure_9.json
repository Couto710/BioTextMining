Downstream from Akt, JNK activation leads to TNF\u03b1 synthesis. Activation of Akt during necroptosis also leads the phosphorylation of several known Akt substrates, such as mTOR, which contribute to the execution of necroptotic death in L929 cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":9,"end":13},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":168,"end":172},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":226,"end":230},"obj":"Protein"}]}
