Luciferase activity in cell extracts was analyzed in a luminometer. Numbers are averages +/\u2212 SD of 3 samples per set-up. (B\u2013D) A20myel-KO and wild type (A20myel-WT) BMDM were transfected with LMW poly(I:C) and analyzed at different time points (minutes) after the start of transfection for I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation and degradation, and IRF3 phosphorylation by immunoblotting of total cell extracts (B). The band that is non-specifically recognized by the anti-I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody (indicated by an asterisk) can be used as a loading control. Nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB (p65) and IRF3 was analyzed by immunoblotting of cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions (C). Quantification of band density for nuclear p65 and IRF3 is shown in bar graphs (expressed as relative density compared to the first lane; \u200a=\u200atime 0). IL-6, TNF and IFN\u03b2 levels in the supernatant of cells used in (B) were determined by bioassay (IL-6) and ELISA (TNF and IFN\u03b2) as described in the \u2018materials and methods\u2019 section (D). Data are representative of 2 independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":23,"end":27},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":54,"end":59},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":127,"end":131},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":144,"end":148},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":159,"end":169},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":246,"end":250},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":580,"end":584},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":622,"end":626},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":853,"end":856},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":862,"end":866},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":982,"end":985},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":990,"end":994},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1089,"end":1093},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1095,"end":1098},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1103,"end":1107},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1184,"end":1188},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1201,"end":1204},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1209,"end":1213},"obj":"Protein"}]}
