The primary structures of p53 and its isoforms are depicted (Figure 2). p53 induces cell cycle arrest by transactivating genes such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, or microRNA miR34. p53 induces apoptosis by transactivating proapoptotic genes such as BAX, PUMA, SCOTIN, and FAS, and inhibiting the antiapoptotic gene BCL-2 (Lane and Levine, 2010). p53 triggers pro-survival or cell death response, depending upon cell types, the intensity of the stress signal, and the extent of cellular damage (Menendez et al., 2009). Also, p53 plays a role in controlling cell motility via regulating the expression of smooth muscle \u03b1-actin (Comer et al., 1998), collagens II\u03b11 and VI\u03b11 (Sun et al., 1999), and many others.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":13},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":142,"end":145},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":188,"end":191},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":285,"end":288},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":302,"end":307},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":309,"end":312},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":377,"end":380},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":382,"end":386},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":388,"end":394},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":400,"end":403},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":443,"end":448},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":474,"end":477},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":652,"end":655},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":731,"end":752},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":775,"end":789},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":794,"end":798},"obj":"Protein"}]}
