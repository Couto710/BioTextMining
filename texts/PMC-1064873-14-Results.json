SOCS3 has recently been shown to specifically inhibit STAT3 activation induced by IL-6 but not by IL-10, thereby regulating the divergent action of IL-6 and IL-10 [8,9]. On the contrary, SOCS1 is able to partially inhibit IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation and cellular responses, as well as IFN-\u03b3-mediated STAT1 activation [32]. To determine whether SOCSs were involved in the defective IL-10-induced STAT3 activation of RA CD4+ T cells, the levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA expression in PB CD4+ T cells from active RA patients and from healthy controls were compared by semiquantitative real-time PCR. The RA CD4+ T cells contained higher levels of SOCS1 but lower levels of SOCS3 transcripts than did control CD4+ T cells (Fig. 6a). Constitutive expression of SOCS1 mRNA in RA CD4+ T cells was comparable with the expression in normal CD4+ T cells stimulated by 10 ng/ml IL-6 (Fig. 6b), supporting its functional significance. Defective IL-10-induced STAT3 activation therefore appears to be due at least in part to an abundance of SOCS1 in RA CD4+ T cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":19,"end":24},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":36,"end":39},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":49,"end":53},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":93,"end":98},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":103,"end":108},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":285,"end":290},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":339,"end":344},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":367,"end":371},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":383,"end":388},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":433,"end":437},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":442,"end":447},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":472,"end":477},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":507,"end":512},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":522,"end":527},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":574,"end":579},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":589,"end":594},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":670,"end":675},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":684,"end":689},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":707,"end":710},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":735,"end":740},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":745,"end":750},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":773,"end":776},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":892,"end":895},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":932,"end":937},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":958,"end":963},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":993,"end":996},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1044,"end":1049},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1061,"end":1064},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1119,"end":1122},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1155,"end":1159},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1221,"end":1226},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1235,"end":1240},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1316,"end":1321},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1328,"end":1331},"obj":"Protein"}]}
