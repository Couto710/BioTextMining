Oligonucleotide probes encompassing the NF-\u03baB binding site of the human IL-17 promoter (5'-ATG ACC TGG AAA TAC CCA AAA TTC-3') were generated by 5'-end labeling of the sense strand with [\u03b3-32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (TaKaRa). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by NucTrap probe purification columns (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Nuclear extracts (2 \u03bcg of protein) were incubated with radiolabeled DNA probes (10 ng; 100,000 c.p.m.) for 30 min at room temperature in 20 \u03bcl of binding buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.2% Nonidet P40 and 50 ng/\u03bcl poly(dI-dC). Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 \u00d7 Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) at 100 V. Gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film at -70\u00b0C with intensifying screens. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against NF-\u03baB subunits p50, p65 and c-Rel were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":176,"end":181},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":1070,"end":1073},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1075,"end":1078},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1083,"end":1088},"obj":"Protein"}]}
