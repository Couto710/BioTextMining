At different hours post infection (hours p.i.) cells were lysed and IL-6, IFN\u03b2 and A20 mRNA expression was analyzed by qPCR (A). 18 hours post infection cell culture supernatant was analyzed for TNF and IFN\u03b2 protein levels by ELISA and multiplexing technologies (B). (C\u2013D) Alveolar macrophages were mock treated or infected with IAV (moi 1) for 18 hours. IL-6 and IFN\u03b2 mRNA expression was determined by qPCR (C). Cell culture supernatant was analyzed for IL-6 and IFN\u03b2 protein levels by ELISA and multiplexing technologies (D). Error bars represent mean values (+/\u2212 SEM) of 2\u20133 samples. Results are representative for 2 independent experiments. ***p\u003C0,001.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":246,"end":250},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":252,"end":256},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":373,"end":376},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":381,"end":385},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":533,"end":537},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":542,"end":546},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":633,"end":637},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":642,"end":646},"obj":"Protein"}]}
