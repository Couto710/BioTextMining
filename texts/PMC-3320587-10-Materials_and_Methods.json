The cultures were grown to an OD650 of 0.4 at 37\u00b0C to ensure that they were in the logarithmic growth phase. Bacteria were then plated, washed with PBS, resuspended in PBS, and passed through a 5 \u00b5m filter to ensure that the bacteria were in a single cell suspension. Bacterial cell numbers were determined by measurement of OD650 before further dilution with RPMI 1640 medium for cell infection studies at 10\u22361 PBMC\u2236 bacilli or 1\u22361 MDM\u2236 bacilli and THP-1\u2236bacilli. Colony-forming unit (CFU) analysis was performed and on days 4 and 7 the average CFU counts were 6\u00d7103 and 5\u00d7104, respectively, confirming that mycobacteria levels increased over the course of infection of primary MDM.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins"}
