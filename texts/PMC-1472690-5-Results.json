Therefore, we applied the IL-1\u03b2/IL-1RA ratio as an indicator of the degree of inflammation. Both, LPS and GP + LPS treatments resulted in generating more IL-1\u03b2 than IL-1RA at early time points, i.e. up to 24 h. Comparing LPS vs. GP + LPS, we did not find substantial alterations over a time course of 48 h in the IL-1\u03b2/IL-1RA ratio, only a \u2013 non-significant \u2013 2.5fold higher ratio at 6 h. With respect to TSST-1 or the theoretical value of GP/TSST-1 calc. vs. GP + TSST-1, we observed a pronounced anti-inflammatory action of GP, as demonstrated by an about 10\u2013100 fold reduced ratio at 18 h and 24 h of incubation, i.e. a higher production of IL-1RA than of IL-1\u03b2 (n = 3; both p \u003C 0.05; Fig. 6). A biological relevance of this result was suggested by a decrease of the IL-1 dependent release of IL-2 from murine EL-4 cells following GP + TSST-1 when compared to TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc. (data not shown in detail, n = 4; p \u003C 0.07).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":17,"end":23},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":32,"end":37},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":38,"end":44},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":116,"end":121},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":126,"end":132},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":235,"end":240},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":241,"end":247},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":363,"end":368},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":374,"end":380},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":522,"end":527},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":528,"end":534},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":614,"end":620},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":652,"end":658},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":674,"end":680},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":853,"end":859},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":868,"end":873},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":979,"end":983},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1005,"end":1009},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1048,"end":1054},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1072,"end":1078},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1085,"end":1091},"obj":"Protein"}]}
