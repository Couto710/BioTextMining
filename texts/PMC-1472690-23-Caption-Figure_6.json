Time course (48 h) of the IL-1\u03b2/IL-1RA ratio following incubation of human PBMC with LPS, TSST-1, GP + LPS, GP/LPS calc., GP + TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc. LPS and GP + LPS treatments resulted in generating more IL-1\u03b2 than IL-1RA up to 24 h. When comparing LPS or GP/LPS calc. vs GP + LPS we did not find significant alterations in the IL-1\u03b2/IL-1RA ratio over 48 h. With respect to TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc. vs GP + TSST-1 we observed a pronounced anti-inflammatory action of GP, as demonstrated by an about 10\u2013100 fold reduced ratio at 18 h and 24 h, i.e. a higher production of IL-1RA than of IL-1\u03b2 (* = p \u003C 0.05). Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 3).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":15},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":16,"end":22},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":44,"end":50},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":68,"end":74},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":102,"end":107},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":108,"end":114},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":166,"end":172},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":203,"end":209},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":216,"end":222},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":285,"end":290},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":296,"end":302},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":409,"end":414},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":415,"end":421},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":455,"end":461},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":468,"end":474},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":489,"end":495},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":653,"end":659},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":668,"end":673},"obj":"Protein"}]}
