Interleukin (IL)-17 is an important regulator of immune and inflammatory responses, including the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and osteoclastic bone resorption. Evidence for the expression and proinflammatory activity of IL-17 has been demonstrated in RA synovium and in animal models of RA. Although some cytokines (IL-15 and IL-23) have been reported to regulate IL-17 production, the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate IL-17 production remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in the regulation of IL-17 production in RA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with RA (n = 24) were separated, then stimulated with various agents including anti-CD3, anti-CD28, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. IL-17 levels were determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction. The production of IL-17 was significantly increased in cells treated with anti-CD3 antibody with or without anti-CD28 and PHA (P \u003C 0.05). Among tested cytokines and chemokines, IL-15, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and IL-6 upregulated IL-17 production (P \u003C 0.05), whereas tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 or transforming growth factor-\u03b2 did not. IL-17 was also detected in the PBMC of patients with osteoarthritis, but their expression levels were much lower than those of RA PBMC. Anti-CD3 antibody activated the PI3K/Akt pathway; activation of this pathway resulted in a pronounced augmentation of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) DNA-binding activity. IL-17 production by activated RA PBMC is completely or partly blocked in the presence of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and the PI3K/Akt inhibitor wortmannin and LY294002, respectively. However, inhibition of activator protein-1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 did not affect IL-17 production. These results suggest that signal transduction pathways dependent on PI3K/Akt and NF-\u03baB are involved in the overproduction of the key inflammatory cytokine IL-17 in RA.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":24},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":68,"end":71},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":263,"end":282},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":494,"end":499},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":590,"end":595},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":600,"end":605},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":638,"end":643},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":707,"end":712},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":827,"end":830},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":860,"end":865},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1034,"end":1038},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1040,"end":1058},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1060,"end":1063},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1116,"end":1121},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1262,"end":1267},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1357,"end":1361},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1366,"end":1369},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1421,"end":1426},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1428,"end":1462},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1467,"end":1471},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1484,"end":1489},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1521,"end":1544},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1546,"end":1551},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1553,"end":1558},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1562,"end":1590},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1600,"end":1605},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1773,"end":1776},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1902,"end":1907},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2052,"end":2055},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2128,"end":2147},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2152,"end":2191},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2192,"end":2193},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2209,"end":2214},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2301,"end":2304},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2383,"end":2388},"obj":"Protein"}]}
