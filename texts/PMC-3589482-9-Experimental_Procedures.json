Transfected cells were transferred to pre-warmed media in 24 well plates and incubated for 48 hrs prior to incubation with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 hrs where indicated. In some experiments, plasmids encoding C/EBP-\u03b2 or C/EBP-\u03b2 phospho-acceptor mutants (T188A, T217A, S64A) [38]\u2013[40] or control vector were co-transfected (0.6\u20131.0 \u00b5g total DNA). Luciferase activity was determined and normalized to that of \u03b2-galactosidase [38] using the Luciferase Assay System and \u03b2-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System Kits, respectively (Promega). Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and triplicate samples were employed for each sample. Expression of the C/EBP-\u03b2 phospho-acceptor mutant proteins was checked for equal expression by western blot.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":27,"end":37},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":57,"end":62},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":120,"end":130},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":170,"end":177},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":178,"end":193},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":506,"end":513},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":517,"end":549},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":551,"end":556},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":558,"end":563},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":565,"end":569},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":643,"end":653},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":704,"end":719},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":735,"end":745},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":763,"end":778},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":952,"end":983},"obj":"Protein"}]}
