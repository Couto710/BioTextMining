In brief, a 96-well plate (Nunc) was coated with 4 \u03bcg/ml monoclonal antibodies against IL-17 (R \u0026 D Systems) at 4\u00b0C overnight. After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline/1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.05% Tween 20 for 2 hours at room temperature (22\u201325\u00b0C), test samples and the standard recombinant IL-17 (R \u0026 D Systems) were added to the 96-well plate and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. Plates were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20, and then incubated with 500 ng/ml biotinylated mouse monoclonal antibodies against IL-17 (R \u0026 D Systems) for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing, streptavidin\u2013alkaline phosphate\u2013horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) was incubated for 2 hours, then washed again and incubated with 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) dissolved in diethanolamine (Sigma) to develop the color reaction. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 M NaOH and the optical density of each well was read at 405 nm. The lower limit of IL-17 detection was 10 pg/ml. Recombinant human IL-17 diluted in culture medium was used as a calibration standard, ranging from 10 to 2000 pg/ml. A standard curve was drawn by plotting optical density against the log of the concentration of recombinant cytokines, and used for determination of IL-17 in test samples.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":37,"end":42},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":43,"end":48},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":249,"end":254},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":465,"end":470},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":720,"end":725},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1163,"end":1168},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1211,"end":1216},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1458,"end":1463},"obj":"Protein"}]}
