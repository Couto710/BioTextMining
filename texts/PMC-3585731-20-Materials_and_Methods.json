After 24\u201348 hr, cells were stimulated with 30 \u00b5M zVAD.fmk or 10 ng/ml mouse TNF\u03b1. For treatments under serum free conditions, cells were serum starved for 24 hr prior to the addition of growth factors, 20 \u00b5M zVAD.fmk or 10 ng/ml mouse TNF\u03b1. Cells were harvested in 1\u00d7RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling) supplemented with 50 \u00b5g/ml phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride. After brief sonication, cell lysates were spun down for 15 min at 14,000\u00d7rpm. Protein concentrations were measured using the Pierce 660 nm Assay Reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of proteins were boiled for 5 min at 95\u00b0C. Western blotting was performed according to standard protocols. Briefly, SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to PVDF membrane, blocked in 3% milk or 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated in 5%BSA/TBST overnight at 4\u00b0C. Secondary antibodies were incubated in TBST for 30 min at room temperature. Luminata (Millipore) ECL reagents were used to develop the signals. In some cases, membranes were stripped using OneMinute stripping buffer (GM Biosciences) and reprobed with new antibodies.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":181,"end":185},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":340,"end":344},"obj":"Protein"}]}
