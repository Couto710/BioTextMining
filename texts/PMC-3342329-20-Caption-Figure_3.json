The apoptotic index was determined as the number of DAPI-stained, TUNEL-positive cells that were counted. Values are the mean \u00b1 S.D. of four experimental animals. * indicates statistically significant differences from CCR5+/+ mice. Scale bar indicates 50 \u00b5m. B and C, Apoptotic protein (cleaved caspase-3 and Bax) in tumor sections were detected by immunofluorescence assay. The reactive cell number was determined as the number of DAPI-stained, Specific antibody (cleaved caspase-3 and Bax)-positive cells that were counted. Values are the mean \u00b1 S.D. of four experimental animals. * indicates statistically significant differences from CCR5+/+ mice. Scale bar indicates 50 \u00b5m. D, The expression of apoptotic proteins was detected by Western blotting using specific antibodies; cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved PARP, Bax, Bcl-2 and c-IAP1 in the tumor tissues. The \u03b2-actin protein was used as an internal control. Each band is representative of three independent experimental results. Data are means \u00b1 S.D. of three experimental animals. * indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (p\u003C0.05).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":54,"end":58},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":433,"end":437},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":853,"end":857},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1061,"end":1067},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1094,"end":1101},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1307,"end":1311},"obj":"Protein"}]}
