Cells were stained, fixed and permeabilized (Cytofix/Cytoperm, BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Activated CD8+ T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry based on CD62lo CD3+ and CD8+ expression. Live/Dead fixable aqua dead cell stain kit (Molecular Probes) was used to discriminate live from dead cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":22,"end":25},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":57,"end":60},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":70,"end":80},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":82,"end":85},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":107,"end":110},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":501,"end":504},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":562,"end":565},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":571,"end":574},"obj":"Protein"}]}
