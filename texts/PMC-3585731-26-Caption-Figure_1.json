Cell viability was determined after 24 hr using the CellTiter-Glo Viability assay. The concentrations of all necroptosis-inducing agents are listed in the Materials and Methods section or indicated in the figures. (B) Cells were treated with zVAD.fmk, the indicated growth factors, and Nec-1 under serum free conditions for 24 hrs followed by measurement of cell viability. (C) Cells under serum free conditions were treated with FGF, zVAD.fmk, or both for 24 hrs followed by viability assay. (D) Cell death was induced by zVAD.fmk or TNF\u03b1 under full serum condition in the presence of 2 \u00b5M PD173074 and 20 \u00b5M PD166866. In all graphs, average\u00b1SD was plotted.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":9,"end":14},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":94,"end":98},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":701,"end":705},"obj":"Protein"}]}
