CD4+ T cells were purified from PBMC by positive selection using anti-CD4 mAb-coated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Gladbach, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD4+ T cells were isolated from ST samples, as previously described [27]. Briefly, fresh ST samples were fragmented and digested with collagenase and DNase for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. After removing tissue debris, ST cell suspensions in culture medium (RPMI 1640 medium; Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES (2 mM L-glutamine, 2% nonessential amino acids, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin; Life Technologies) with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Life Technologies) were incubated at 37\u00b0C in six-well plates (Coster, Cambridge, MA, USA) for 45 min. Non-adherent cells were harvested and CD4+ T cells were purified by positive selection as already described.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":13,"end":16},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":199,"end":202},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":269,"end":272},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":383,"end":386},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1006,"end":1009},"obj":"Protein"}]}
