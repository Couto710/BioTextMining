IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 protein levels were determined with an ELISA kit (PBL Biomedical Laboratories). For IFN\u03b3 ELISA, 96-well plates were coated with IFN\u03b3 coating (XMG1.2) and detection (R4-6A2) antibodies (eBiosciences). Detection of MCP-1, KC, TNF, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in BAL fluid was performed using Bioplex (BioRad) technology according to the manufacturer's instructions. Milliplex technology (Millipore) was used for the detection of MIP-2 in BAL fluid.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":31},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":71,"end":74},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":162,"end":166},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":380,"end":385},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":387,"end":389},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":391,"end":394},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":396,"end":401},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":406,"end":410},"obj":"Protein"}]}
