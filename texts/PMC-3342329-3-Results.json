To evaluate whether the tumor inhibition was related with the inactivation of NF-\u03baB in melanoma, the DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB was determined by electromobility shift assay (EMSA) in melanoma tissue. The constitutively activated DNA binding activity was reduced in the CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice tumor tissue (Figure 2A). Moreover, the translocation of p50 and p-p65 into the nucleus through the inhibition of phosphorylation of I\u03baB was also prevented in the tumor tissues of CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 2B). Immunofluorescence analysis also confirmed that the intensity of nuclear staining for p50 had decreased in the tumor tissues of CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 2C).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":46,"end":50},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":170,"end":174},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":460,"end":464},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":530,"end":533},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":540,"end":543},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":653,"end":657},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":765,"end":768},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":807,"end":811},"obj":"Protein"}]}
