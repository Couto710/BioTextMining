In our previous [18,25] and preliminary data, neuronal damage was first detectable at 3 days after SE. Therefore, we determined 3 days after SE as the best time point to look FJB. Briefly, sections were rinsed in distilled water, and mounted onto gelatin-coated slides and then dried on a slide warmer. The slides were immersed in 100% ethanol for 3 min, followed by 70% ethanol for 2 min and distilled water for 2 min. The slides were then transferred to 0.06% potassium permanganate for 15 min and gently agitated. After rinsing in distilled water for 2 min, the slides were incubated for 30 min in 0.001% FJB (Histo-Chem Inc., Jefferson, AR), freshly prepared by adding 20 ml of a 0.01% stock FJB solution to 180 ml of 0.1% acetic acid, with gentle shaking in the dark. After rinsing for 1 min in each of three changes of distilled water, the slides were dried, dehydrated in xylene and coverslipped with DPX (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO). For stereological study, every sixth section in the series throughout the entire PC was used (see below).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins"}
