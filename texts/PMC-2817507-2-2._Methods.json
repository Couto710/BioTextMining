Animals\nNinety Wister rats (male, body weight: 250\u2009g to 300\u2009g) were provided by Experimental Animal Center, China Medical University. The rats were assigned randomly to three groups: normal group (N, n = 10, without any treatment), normal saline control (S, n = 40, intra-cerebral injection of normal saline as control) and intra-cerebral hemorrhage group (ICH, n = 40). The experimental protocol used for animals was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee, China Medical University. The rats were subjected to intra-cerebral injection of normal saline or autologous whole blood and were sacrificed on 6\u2009hours, 1 day, 3 days and 7 days after the injection, respectively. Five rats in each group at each time point were sacrificed by transcardially perfusion of normal saline followed by 4% buffered Para formaldehyde (pH = 7.4). The brains were removed, postfixed, embedded in paraffin, and cut into sections (7\u2009\u03bcm) as described previously [8]. Five rats in each group at each time point were sacrificed by over dose injection of Ketamine. The brains were removed and stored at minus 80\u00b0C for RT-PCR and Western Blots.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins"}
