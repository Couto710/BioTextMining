MIP-2 is undetectable or present at low levels under physiological conditions, and shows transient increases under pathological conditions via TNF-\u03b1 and/or interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2)-dependent mechanisms [14]. Thus, it would be plausible that TNF-\u03b1-mediated MIP-2 expression may provoke SE-induced neutrophil infiltrations. To confirm this hypothesis, we investigated MIP-2 expression in the PC. Consistent with our previous study [20], some MIP-2-positive astrocytes were observed in the core and periphery of the vasogenic edema lesions, but not in the non-vasogenic edema region (Figure 6B and 6C). Although the number of MIP-2 positive cells per unit area in the PC region of sTNFp55R-infused animals was significantly lower than that of the saline-infused group due to reduction of the area of vasogenic edema, there was no difference in the number of MIP-2 positive cells per unit area of vasogenic edema between sTNFp55R-infused animals and saline-infused animals (Figure 6F). Furthermore, the number of MIP-2-positive cells showed a direct proportion to the unit area of vasogenic edema with a linear coefficient of correlation of 0.682 (p \u003C 0.05, Figure 6G). Therefore, together with reduction in neutrophil infiltration in the PC region of sTNFp55R-infused animals, our findings provide evidence that TNF-\u03b1 may regulate SE-induced neutrophil infiltration at least in the PC via vasogenic edema formation and not via direct TNF-\u03b1-mediated MIP-2 expression in astrocytes.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":17,"end":22},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":37,"end":46},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":100,"end":105},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":243,"end":248},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":256,"end":270},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":272,"end":277},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":339,"end":344},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":354,"end":359},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":464,"end":469},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":538,"end":543},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":721,"end":726},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":777,"end":784},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":953,"end":958},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1016,"end":1023},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1107,"end":1112},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1347,"end":1354},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1407,"end":1412},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1529,"end":1534},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1544,"end":1549},"obj":"Protein"}]}
