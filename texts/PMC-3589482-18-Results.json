Consisting of six members, the C/EBP transcription factors can homo\u2212/heterodimerize and display similar DNA binding specificities [60]. Four family members, C/EBP-\u03b1, C/EBP-\u03b2, C/EBP-\u03b4 and C/EBP-\u03b5, are present in myeloid cells and play different roles in differentiating myeloid cells depending on the extracellular environment [61]. To determine which C/EBP proteins were involved in the formation of the different nucleo-protein complexes, and particularly of the LPS-inducible complex, EMSA was performed after incubating the nucleo-protein complexes with antibodies specific for C/EBP-\u03b1, C/EBP-\u03b2, C/EBP-\u03b4 and C/EBP-\u03b5. Each antibody detects the carboxy-terminal DNA-binding region of the respective protein, so that pre-incubation of antibody with nuclear extract is expected to abolish DNA binding by EMSA [62]. Only antibodies against C/EBP-\u03b2 abolished the formation of the LPS-inducible complex (Fig. 5C). Taken together these data show that the LPS-induced complex with the C/EBP element (\u2212203/\u2212192) contains C/EBP-\u03b2.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":7},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":79,"end":87},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":403,"end":410},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":412,"end":419},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":421,"end":428},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":433,"end":440},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":827,"end":834},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":836,"end":843},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":845,"end":852},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":857,"end":864},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1084,"end":1091},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1260,"end":1267},"obj":"Protein"}]}
