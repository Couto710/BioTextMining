The reaction conditions were 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 sec and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. The results were normalized using \u03b2-actin mRNA as an internal control and expressed as relative values.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":283,"end":290},"obj":"Protein"}]}
