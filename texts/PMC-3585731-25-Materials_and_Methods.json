In brief, Myr-Akt was immunoprecipitated from L929 cells using anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma). The in vitro assay was performed in the presence of a GSK fusion protein substrate. Phosphorylation of the GSK fusion protein was visualized by western blot.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":149,"end":156},"obj":"Protein"}]}
