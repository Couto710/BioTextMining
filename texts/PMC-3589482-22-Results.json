To investigate C/EBP-\u03b2 phosphorylation sites that may be important for LPS-stimulated SerpinB2 proximal promoter activity (Fig. 8B), we co-expressed several C/EBP-\u03b2 phospho-acceptor mutants in which the critical threonine or serine residue was mutated to an alanine, along with the pGLmP-539 murine SerpinB2 luciferase reporter in Cebpb\u2212/\u2212 MEFs. Re-expression of wild-type C/EBP-\u03b2 in Cebpb\u2212/\u2212 MEFs significantly stimulated SerpinB2 luciferase reporter gene expression in the presence of LPS by \u223c3 fold (Fig. 8C, left), confirming the importance of C/EBP-\u03b2 to LPS-induced SerpinB2 gene transcription. Expression of the C/EBP-\u03b2 phospho-acceptor mutant, C/EBP\u03b2T217A, in Cebpb\u2212/\u2212 MEFs did not significantly increase SerpinB2 promoter activity above that of wild-type C/EBP-\u03b2 (Fig. 8C, right); confirming that phosphorylation of C/EBP-\u03b2 at T217 is not a major factor in the regulation of SerpinB2 promoter activity in response to LPS.\nC/EBP-\u03b2 contains additional phosphorylation sites, C/EBP-\u03b2T188 and C/EBP-\u03b2S64 (Fig. 8B), which may be involved in modulating C/EBP-\u03b2-dependent SerpinB2 gene transcription. C/EBP-\u03b2T188 is implicated in regulating DAPK1, an IFN\u03b3-inducible gene involved in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis [38], processes with which SerpinB2 has also been associated [17]. C/EBP-\u03b2S64 is important for LPS-induced transcription of the cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1 [64]. Similarly, SerpinB2 is induced by LPS and regulated in a manner similar to cytokines [29]. Given the similarities in the functional significance of these phospho-specific isoforms of C/EBP-\u03b2 and SerpinB2, we investigated whether these phospho-acceptor sites may play a role in SerpinB2 gene expression. C/EBP-\u03b2T188A-transfected MEFs exhibited SerpinB2 promoter activity similar to that of wild-type C/EBP-\u03b2-transfected MEFs, whereas the expression of C/EBP-\u03b2S64A potentiated SerpinB2 promoter activity in response to LPS (Fig. 8C, right). These data suggest that phosphorylation of C/EBP-\u03b2 at S64 acts to negatively regulate SerpinB2 proximal promoter activity.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":19,"end":26},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":76,"end":84},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":122,"end":129},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":212,"end":219},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":283,"end":291},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":354,"end":386},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":496,"end":524},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":528,"end":533},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":570,"end":577},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":581,"end":586},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":620,"end":648},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":745,"end":752},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":768,"end":776},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":815,"end":846},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":848,"end":859},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":864,"end":869},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":909,"end":917},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":960,"end":967},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1021,"end":1028},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1088},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1127,"end":1134},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1252,"end":1259},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1270,"end":1278},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1339,"end":1344},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1349,"end":1353},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1364,"end":1368},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1451,"end":1459},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1562,"end":1566},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1571,"end":1576},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1594,"end":1602},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1766,"end":1773},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1778,"end":1786},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1860,"end":1868},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1886,"end":1898},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1926,"end":1934},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1982,"end":1989},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":2034,"end":2045},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":2058,"end":2066},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":2165,"end":2172},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":2208,"end":2216},"obj":"Protein"}]}
