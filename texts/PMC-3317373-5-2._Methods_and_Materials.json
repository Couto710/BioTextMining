Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)\nMonolayers of astrocytes were washed with PBS and harvested by scraping into cold PBS. The cell pellet obtained by centrifugation was resuspended in buffer containing 10\u2009mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 10\u2009mM KCl, 0.1\u2009mM EDTA, 0.1\u2009mM EGTA, 1.0\u2009mM DTT, and 0.5\u2009mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Then 10% Nonidet P-40 was added and vortexed briefly, and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation. The nuclear proteins were extracted with buffer containing 20\u2009mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4\u2009mM NaCl, 1.0\u2009mM EDTA, 1.0\u2009mM EGTA, 1.0\u2009mM DTT, and 1.0\u2009mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14000\u2009rpm, and the supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was stored at \u201380\u00b0C until use. Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard (Pierce Biochemicals, Rockford, IL, USA). EMSA was performed using gel shift assay system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Consensus oligonucleotide probe (5\u2032-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGG-3\u2032) was end-labeled by T4-polynucleotide kinase using [\u03b3-32P]-ATP (Free Biotech., Beijing, China). Nuclear protein (20\u2009\u03bcg) was preincubated in 20\u2009\u03bcL binding buffer containing 10\u2009mM Tris-HCl (PH 7.5), 1\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.5\u2009mM\u2009NaCl, 4% glycerol, 0.5\u2009mM EDTA, 0.5\u2009mM DTT, and 2\u2009\u03bcg poly dI-dC for 20 minutes on ice. After addition of the 1\u2009\u03bcL 32P-labled oligonucleotide probe, the incubation was continued for 20 minutes on ice. The DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 \u00d7 TBE buffer (tris-borate-EDTA) at 390\u2009V for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to X-ray film (Fuji Hyperfilm, Tokyo, Japan). Levels of NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity were quantified by software ImageJ.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins"}
