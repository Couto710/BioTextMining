All patients were receiving prednisolone (\u2264 7.5 mg/day) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Clinical parameters in the study patients were as follows (mean \u00b1 standard deviation): erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 55.9 \u00b1 35.4 mm/hour; serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level, 32.0 \u00b1 32.0 mg/l; and IgM class rheumatoid factor titer, 142 \u00b1 158 U/ml. Patients were divided into two groups: 24 patients with active disease, who had multiple tender and/or swollen joints and elevated serum CRP level (\u2265 10 mg/l); and eight patients with inactive disease, who satisfied the American College of Rheumatology preliminary criteria for clinical remission [26]. Sixteen healthy volunteers (11 women and five men; age, 45.8 \u00b1 11.2 years) served as controls. ST samples were obtained from three RA patients undergoing total knee replacement. All patients gave informed consent.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins"}
