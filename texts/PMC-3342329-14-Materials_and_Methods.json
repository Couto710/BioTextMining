The tumor tissues were briefly homogenized in 200 \u00b5l of solution A (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride), vortexed vigorously, incubated on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 15 min. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in solution C (solution A supplemented with 420 mM NaCl and 20% glycerol), and incubated on ice for 20 min. The resuspended pellet was centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 15 min, and the resulting nuclear extracts supernatant were collected in a chilled Eppendorf tube. Consensus oligonucleotides were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [P32]-ATP for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The gel shift reactions were assembled and incubated at room temperature. Subsequently, 1 ml of gel loading buffer was added to each reaction and loaded onto a 6% non-denaturating gel. The gel was subjected to electrophoresis until the dye was four-fifths of the way down the gel. The gel was dried for 1 h at 80\u00b0C and exposed to film overnight at -70\u00b0C.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins"}
