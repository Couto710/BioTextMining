Among 40 tested cytokines, the levels of IL-1Ra, MIG, MIP-1\u03b1 increased about 686, 9 and 25-fold respectively, in CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to CCR5+/+ mice. Using this technique, no other cytokines were found to be different between the CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice and the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 4B). Similar altered cytokine levels were found in the spleens of CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 4C). Since the IL-1Ra level was the most significantly elevated, the expression of IL-1Ra in tumor and spleen tissues was analyzed by immunofluorescence and western blotting. The expression of IL-1Ra was upregulated in tumor and spleen tissues of the CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 4D-G).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":16,"end":22},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":50,"end":54},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":160,"end":164},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":172,"end":176},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":305,"end":311},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":313,"end":316},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":318,"end":324},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":377,"end":381},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":402,"end":406},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":496,"end":500},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":517,"end":521},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":604,"end":608},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":640,"end":646},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":708,"end":714},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":818,"end":824},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":876,"end":880},"obj":"Protein"}]}
