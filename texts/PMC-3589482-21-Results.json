The ability of endogenous C/EBP-\u03b2 to direct transcription from the SerpinB2 proximal promoter was examined by transfection of the pGLmP-539 murine SerpinB2 luciferase reporter construct into Cebpb+/+ and Cebpb\u2212/\u2212 MEFs. We found that LPS-stimulated SerpinB2 promoter activity was significantly increased in Cebpb+/+ MEFs and abrogated in Cebpb\u2212/\u2212 MEFs (Fig. 8A), indicating that endogenous C/EBP-\u03b2 is required for LPS-induced SerpinB2 proximal promoter activity.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":7},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":38,"end":46},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":80,"end":87},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":101,"end":109},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":227,"end":234},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":294,"end":302},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":367,"end":374},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":408,"end":416},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":488,"end":516},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":532,"end":537},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":545,"end":550},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":589,"end":597},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":647,"end":652},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":678,"end":683},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":730,"end":737},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":766,"end":774},"obj":"Protein"}]}
