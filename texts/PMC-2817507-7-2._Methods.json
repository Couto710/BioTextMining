Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)\nNuclear proteins were isolated from brain tissue. Briefly, after removal of supernatant (cytoplasmic extract), the pellets were resuspended in nuclear extraction reagent. The tubes containing pellets were put on vortex for 15 seconds every 10 minutes, for a total of 40 minutes. The tubes were centrifuged at maximum speed (~16,000 \u00d7\u2009g) in a micro centrifuge for 10 minutes. The supernatants (nuclear extract) were transferred to a clean prechilled tube and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. EMSA was performed as described previously [8]. NF\u03baB binding activity was examined in a 15\u2009\u03bcL binding reaction mixture containing 15\u2009\u03bcg of nuclear proteins and 35\u2009fmol [\u03b3-32P] labeled double-stranded NF\u03baB consensus oligonucleotide. A super shift assay using antibodies to P65 and P50 was performed to confirm NF\u03baB binding specificity as previously described.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":806,"end":809},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":814,"end":817},"obj":"Protein"}]}
