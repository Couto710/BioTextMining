The HIV-1Lai/Bal-Env infectious molecular clone was constructed by replacing the envelope (env) gp160 amino acids 103\u2013717 of the HIV-1Lai (B subtype that utilizes CXCR4) molecular clone with the corresponding region of HIV-1Bal (B subtype that utilizes CCR5). The HIV-1Lai/Bal-Env chimeric virus uses CCR5 as a secondary receptor. The infectious molecular clone of HIV-198IN22 was constructed using DNA extracted from PBMC that were infected with a primary isolate of HIV-198IN22. HIV-1Lai/Bal-Env and HIV-198IN22 mutant viruses were constructed by introducing point mutations using standard PCR-based mutagenesis methods.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":268,"end":273},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":335,"end":340},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":425,"end":429},"obj":"Protein"}]}
