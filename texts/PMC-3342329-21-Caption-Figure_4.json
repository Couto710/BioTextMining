Nitrocellulose membranes contain 40 different anti-cytokine antibodies printed in duplicate. B, Mouse cytokine array panel indicate the cytokine expression difference in tumor tissues of CCR5+/+ mice and CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice, especially IL-1Ra. Representative blot from three independent experiments is shown. Positive controls show the manufacturer\u2019s internal positive control samples on the membrane. C, Protein immune-arrays were performed using Mouse cytokine array in spleen tissues. There were differences in cytokines between CCR5+/+ mice and CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice, especially IL-1Ra. Representative blot from three independent experiments is shown. Positive controls show the manufacturer\u2019s internal positive control samples on the membrane. D and E, Immunolfluorescence analysis was used to determine the expression levels of IL-1Ra in tumor and spleen tissues. The reactive cell number was determined as the number of DAPI-stained, IL-1Ra antibody-positive cells that were counted. Values are the mean \u00b1 S.D. of four experimental animals. * indicates statistically significant differences from CCR5+/+ mice. Scale bar indicates 50 \u00b5m. F and G, Expression of IL-1Ra was analyzed by western blotting in tumor and spleen tissues. Each band is representative of three independent experimental results. Data are means \u00b1 S.D. of three experimental animals. * indicates significant difference from CCR5+/+ mice (p\u003C0.05).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":16,"end":22},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":50,"end":54},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":314,"end":318},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":331,"end":335},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":356,"end":362},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":652,"end":656},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":669,"end":673},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":694,"end":700},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":945,"end":951},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1214,"end":1218},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1278,"end":1284},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1511,"end":1515},"obj":"Protein"}]}
