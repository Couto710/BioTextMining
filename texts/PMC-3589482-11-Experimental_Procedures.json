Briefly, after crosslinking the chromatin with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and neutralizing with glycine for 5 min at room temperature, cells were washed with cold PBS, scraped and collected on ice. Cells extracts were prepared using a commercially available kit (Millipore). Nuclear lysates were sonicated 5 times for 15 sec with 1 min intervals on ice using a Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher). An equal amount of chromatin was immunoprecipitated at 4\u00b0C overnight with at least 1 \u00b5g of the following antibodies: C/EBP-\u03b2 (sc-150X), p-C/EBP-\u03b2 (T217) (sc-16993X), normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027)(Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and RNA polymerase II (Clone CTD4H8)(Millipore). Immunoprecipitated products were collected after incubation with Protein G coated magnetic beads (Millipore). The beads were washed, the bound chromatin was eluted in ChIP Elution Buffer (Millipore) and the proteins were digested with Proteinase K for 2 hrs at 62\u00b0C. The DNA was then purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). DNA was amplified by semi-quantitative PCR or by qPCR using the SYBR green method and primers specific for the SerpinB2 proximal promoter: forward (\u2212338/\u2212315) 5\u2032AAGACTCCCACAGATGGTGGCTGT3\u2019; reverse (\u22125/+19) 5\u2032TTCTTGGAAAGCTGGCACTGTGTG3\u2019.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":938,"end":947},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":1108,"end":1120},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1327,"end":1335},"obj":"Protein"}]}
