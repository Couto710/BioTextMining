Wild-type MEFs express low levels of endogenous SerpinB2 and the absence of C/EBP-\u03b2 attenuated endogenous SerpinB2 mRNA expression. LPS stimulated an increase in SerpinB2 mRNA expression in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 6A), whereas LPS-stimulated SerpinB2 mRNA expression was significantly dampened in Cebpb\u2212/\u2212 MEFs as compared to wild-type. We next tested if similar effects could be seen in thioglycollate-elicited inflammatory macrophages in which C/EBP-\u03b2 expression was knocked down using species-specific lentiviral shRNAs (Fig. 6B, left). As was observed in MEFs, both constitutive and LPS-induced SerpinB2 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in C/EBP-\u03b2-deficient inflammatory macrophages (Fig. 6B, right). These data show that C/EBP-\u03b2 is critical for mediating constitutive and LPS-inducible transcription of endogenous SerpinB2 mRNA.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":7},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":51,"end":59},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":154,"end":161},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":176,"end":184},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":233,"end":240},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":247,"end":252},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":277,"end":282},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":343,"end":350},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":400,"end":408},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":428,"end":435},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":458,"end":466},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":514,"end":522},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":591,"end":599},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":646,"end":651},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":795,"end":802},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":948,"end":956},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1004,"end":1011},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1086,"end":1093},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1179,"end":1187},"obj":"Protein"}]}
