At day 4, 7 and 10 post infection (p.i.) viral titers in the lung were measured and expressed as mean TCID50 (B). The dashed line represents the detection limit. ND, not detectable. BAL was isolated from IAV infected mice at 4, 7 and 10 days p.i. and KC, MIP-2, MCP-1, IL-6 and IFN\u03b1 protein levels were analyzed by ELISA and multiplexing technologies (C). Absolute numbers of resident alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes in BAL were analyzed by flow cytometry at 4, 7 and 10 days p.i. (D). Numbers are averages +/\u2212 SEM of at least 5 mice per group and are representative of 2 independent experiments. *p\u003C0.05; **p\u003C0.01.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":442,"end":444},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":446,"end":451},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":453,"end":458},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":460,"end":464},"obj":"Protein"}]}
