RAW 264.7 nuclear extracts were prepared by the detergent lysis method [41]. DNA binding reactions (25 \u00b5l) containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 10 \u00b5g/ml BSA, 2 mM DTT, 30% glycerol, 20% Ficoll-400, 1 \u00b5g poly (dI-dC), 6 \u00b5g of nuclear extracts and 10,000 to 20,000 cpm (0.05 to 0.2 ng) of radiolabelled probe were performed for 20 minutes at room temperature. Binding reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis at room temperature on 5% polyacrylamide gels (29\u22361 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide (Bio-Rad)) in 1x TBE at 10V/cm. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were pre-incubated 2 hrs on ice with 4 \u00b5g of specific C/EBP antibody. Antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz: anti-C/EBP-\u03b1 (sc-61), anti-C/EBP-\u03b2 (sc-150), anti-C/EBP-\u03b4 (sc-151) and anti-C/EBP-\u03b5 (sc-158).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":133,"end":157},"obj":"Protein"}]}
