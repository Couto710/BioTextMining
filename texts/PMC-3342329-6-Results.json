By staining the tumor sections from CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice, we found that there was a significant influx of CD8+ cells into the tumor, as well as an increase in the number of infiltrating NK cells (Figure 5A). CD8+ T cells and CD57+ NK cells were spread diffusely throughout the entire sections. To further investigate the differences in the numbers of CD8+ T cells and CD57+ NK cells between CCR5+/+ mice and CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice in immunity-related organ, we also analyzed the CD8 and CD57 reactive cell number in spleen tissues. The number of CD8+ T cells and CD57+ NK cells were higher in the spleen of the CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice than in the spleen of the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 5B). These data suggest that by promoting the infiltration of CD8 T cells and NK cells, which are potent cytotoxic effectors for tumors, could play a role in an anti-tumor effect in CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice.\nTo analyze the cell phenotype change in CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice and CCR5+/+ mice by inoculation of the melanoma cell, lymphocytes were isolated from the tumor and spleen tissues. The B, CD3 T, CD4 T, CD 8 T and NK cell portion of CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice tumor tissue were 7.2%, 48.2%, 16.9%, 32.1% and 7.8%, respectively, compared to 2.9%, 11.1%, 2.3%, 0.6% and 3.1% of CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 5C). The lymphocytes that infiltrated the tumor tissue of the CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice also had higher levels of CD19, CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD57 when compared to the CCR5+/+ mice. The B, CD3 T, CD4 T, CD 8 T and NK cell portion of the CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice spleen were 61.3%, 33.4%, 17.6%, 9.2% and 0.6%, respectively compared to 38.3%, 5.9%, 4.0%, 1.0% and 3.9% of the CCR5+/+ mice (Figure 5D). These data suggest that by promoting the infiltration of CD8 T cells and NK cells, which are potent cytotoxic effectors for tumors, could play a role in the inhibition of tumor growth in CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":75,"end":79},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":145,"end":149},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":364,"end":368},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":711,"end":715},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":728,"end":732},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":921,"end":925},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":960,"end":964},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1163,"end":1167},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1221},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1234,"end":1238},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1359,"end":1362},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1396,"end":1400},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1525,"end":1529},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1608,"end":1612},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1647,"end":1651},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1658,"end":1661},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1697,"end":1701},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1725,"end":1728},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1766,"end":1770},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1892,"end":1896},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":2105,"end":2109},"obj":"Protein"}]}
