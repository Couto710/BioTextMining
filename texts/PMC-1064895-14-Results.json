To evaluate the effects of inflammatory cytokines released by activated PBMC, we tested the effects of several cytokines and chemokines on IL-17 production. We detected an increase in IL-17 level after stimulation with IL-15 (10 ng/ml), whereas with IL-1\u03b2 (10 ng/ml), TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), IL-18 (10 ng/ml) or TGF-\u03b2 (10 ng/ml) the levels in IL-17 were unchanged (Fig. 2a). When treated with MCP-1 (10 ng/ml) or IL-6 (10 ng/ml), significant upregulations of IL-17 proteins were observed (62 \u00b1 42 and 50 \u00b1 10 versus 31 \u00b1 11 pg/ml, respectively; P \u003C 0.05), whereas none was observed with IL-8 (10 ng/ml), MIP-1\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or MIP-1\u03b2 (10 ng/ml) (Fig. 2b).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":19},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":264,"end":269},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":423,"end":428},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":468,"end":473},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":503,"end":508},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":534,"end":539},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":552,"end":557},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":570,"end":575},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":590,"end":595},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":621,"end":626},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":671,"end":676},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":691,"end":695},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":737,"end":742},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":865,"end":869},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":882,"end":888},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":903,"end":909},"obj":"Protein"}]}
