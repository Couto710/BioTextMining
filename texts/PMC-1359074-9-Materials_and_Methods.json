A 2.2-kb fragment upstream of the \u025by globin initiation codon (ATG) was used, because it has been shown that all sequences required for \u025b gene silencing are located within a 3.7-kb EcoRI fragment containing about 2 kb of sequence upstream of the \u025b globin gene cap site [50]. Nucleotide numbering is relative to the transcription start site. The transcriptional start site is based on the longest cDNA in the Fantom (Functional Annotation of Mouse) database. The PCR primers contained XhoI and HindIII sites that were used to clone the \u025by promoter fragment upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in pGL3 Basic (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States). A 2.5-kb SstI/XhoI fragment of \u03bcLCR\u03b2 9.3 (micro LCR; [31]) was then inserted upstream of the \u025by promoter in the above pGL3 Basic plasmid, resulting in a reporter construct in which luciferase expression is driven by the \u025by promoter. A series of deletion constructs of the \u025by promoter were generated similarly. Forward primers with an XhoI site include: MHB1457, 5\u2032CCGCTCGAGTGCTAGGCAAACACTCA3\u2032 (\u22122077 to \u22122052); MHB1503, 5\u2032CCGCTCGAGTCTCTACACTGTCACTCCCTG3\u2032 (\u2212634 to \u2212605); MHB1505, 5\u2032CCGCTCGAGGGAGCCAAAAAAAGAATGC3\u2032 (\u2212197 to \u2212169); MHB1506, 5\u2032CCGCTCGAGCTGACCAATGGCTTCAAAG3\u2032 (\u221285 to \u221258); MHB1532, 5\u2032CCGCTCGAGAATGCAGAACAAAGGGTCAGA3\u2032 (\u221263 to \u221234); and MHB1507, 5\u2032CCGCTCGAGGTCTGCGAAGAATAAAAGGC 3\u2032 (\u221237 to \u22129). All forward primers were used in combination with the reverse primer HindIII site: MHB1477, 5\u2032CGGAAGCTTGGGAGGTTGCTGGTGA3\u2032 (+45 to +20).\nSox6-pcDNA3.1 [15] was used to overexpress Sox6. A truncated version of the Sox6 overexpression construct (Sox6-\u0394HMG-pcDNA3.1) that lacks the HMG domain was generated, as described by others [32]. Mutagenesis of Sox/Sox6 consensus binding sites of the \u025by promoter were done by PCR. Forward primers used to generate these mutagenized \u025by promoter reporter constructs include: MHB1661, 5\u2032CCGCTCGAGAATGCAGTGCCAAGGGTCAGAACATTGTCTGCGAAG3\u2032 (\u221263 to \u221219); MHB1662, 5\u2032CCGCTCGAGAATGCAGAACAAAGGGTCAGATGAGTGTCTGCGAAGAA3\u2032 (\u221263 to \u221216); and MHB1663, 5\u2032CCGCTCGAGAATGCATGCCAAGGGTCAGATGAGTGTCTGCGAAGAA 3\u2032 (\u221263 to \u221218).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":26,"end":28},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":114,"end":116},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":170,"end":179},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":271,"end":272},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":381,"end":389},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":670,"end":672},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":715,"end":725},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":884,"end":886},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":972,"end":982},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1011,"end":1013},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1063,"end":1065},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1631,"end":1635},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1674,"end":1678},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1707,"end":1711},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1738,"end":1742},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1883,"end":1885},"obj":"Protein"}]}
