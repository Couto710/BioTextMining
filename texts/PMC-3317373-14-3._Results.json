Expression and Activity of MMP9 Were Greatly Enhanced in Nrf2 Knockout Astrocytes after Scratch Injury\nMMP9 is an important gelatinase to induce or aggravate the inflammation process. In the present study, we elevated the mRNA, protein levels, and activity of MMP9 in astrocytes at 24\u2009h after scratch injury by RT-PCR, western blot, and gelatine zymography. Expression of MMP9 was elevated after scratch injury in WT and KO astrocytes as compared with their sham counterparts. The mRNA level of MMP9 was higher in group KO TBI than in group WT TBI (1.36 \u00b1 0.090 versus 1.01 \u00b1 0.068, P \u003C 0.01) (Figures 3(a) and 3(e)). Significant difference was also discovered in MMP9 protein level by western blot, as 1.44 \u00b1 0.076 for group KO TBI and 1.13 \u00b1 0.048 for group WT TBI (P \u003C 0.01) (Figure 5). Gelatine zymography revealed higher MMP9 activity in group KO TBI than that in group WT TBI too (101.76 \u00b1 6.343 versus 76.32 \u00b1 3.388, P \u003C 0.01) (Figure 6).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":32,"end":36},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":108,"end":112},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":265,"end":269},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":377,"end":381},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":500,"end":504},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":669,"end":673},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":831,"end":835},"obj":"Protein"}]}
