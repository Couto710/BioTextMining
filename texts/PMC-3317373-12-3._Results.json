Disruption of Nrf2 Enhanced Upregulation of NF-\u03baB DNA-Binding Activity after Scratch Injury\nIt has been reported that NF-\u03baB is activated in brain after TBI [2]. Here, we studied the DNA-binding activity of NF-\u03baB of astrocytes from Nrf2 WT or KO mice by EMSA at 24\u2009h after scratch injury. Scratch injury induced activation of NF-\u03baB in astrocytes of both genotypes, while higher NF-\u03baB activity was observed in group KO TBI than in group WT TBI (2.67 \u00b1 0.173 versus 2.28 \u00b1 0.072, P \u003C 0.01) (Figure 2).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins"}
