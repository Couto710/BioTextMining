CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice showed reduced tumor volume, tumor weight, and increased survival rate when compared to CCR5+/+ mice. We investigated the activation of NF-\u03baB since it is an implicated transcription factor in the regulation of genes involving cell growth, apoptosis, and tumor growth. Significant inhibition of DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB, and translocation of p50 and p65 into the nucleus through the inhibition of phosphorylation of I\u03baB was found in the melanoma tissues of CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to melanoma tissues of CCR5+/+ mice. NF-\u03baB target apoptotic protein expression, such as cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, and Bax, was elevated, whereas the survival protein expression levels, such as Bcl-2, C-IAP1, was decreased in the melanoma tissues of CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice. Interestingly, we found that the level of IL-1Ra, a tumor growth suppressive cytokine, was significantly elevated in tumor tissue and spleen of CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to the level in CCR5+/+ mice. Moreover, infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic T cell and CD57+ natural killer cells was significantly increased in melanoma tumor and spleen tissue of CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to that of CCR5+/+ mice. Therefore, these results showed that CCR5 deficiency caused apoptotic cell death of melanoma through inhibition of NF-\u03baB and upregulation of IL-1Ra.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":38},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":112,"end":118},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":166,"end":195},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":197,"end":201},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":268,"end":272},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":283,"end":287},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":312,"end":316},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":327,"end":331},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":428,"end":432},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":686,"end":689},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":694,"end":697},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":801,"end":805},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":846,"end":850},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1030,"end":1036},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1079,"end":1083},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1135,"end":1141},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1237,"end":1241},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1275,"end":1279},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1435,"end":1439},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1468,"end":1472},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1519,"end":1523},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1623,"end":1629},"obj":"Protein"}]}
