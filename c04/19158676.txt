AIM2 activates the inflammasome and cell death in response to cytoplasmic DNA Summary Host- and pathogen-associated cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA triggers the activation of a NALP3 (also known as cryopyrin and NLRP3)-independent inflammasome 1 , which activates caspase-1 leading to maturation of pro-interleukin-1? and inflammation. The nature of the cytoplasmic-DNA-sensing inflammasome is currently unknown. Here we show that AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2), an interferon-inducible HIN-200 family member that contains an amino-terminal pyrin domain and a carboxy-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding domain 2 , 3 , senses cytoplasmic DNA by means of its oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding domain and interacts with ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) through its pyrin domain to activate caspase-1. The interaction of AIM2 with ASC also leads to the formation of the ASC pyroptosome 4 , which induces pyroptotic cell death in cells containing caspase-1. Knockdown of AIM2 by short interfering RNA reduced inflammasome/pyroptosome activation by cytoplasmic DNA in human and mouse macrophages, whereas stable expression of AIM2 in the non-responsive human embryonic kidney 293T cell line conferred responsiveness to cytoplasmic DNA. Our results show that cytoplasmic DNA triggers formation of the AIM2 inflammasome by inducing AIM2 oligomerization. This study identifies AIM2 as an important inflammasome component that senses potentially dangerous cytoplasmic DNA, leading to activation of the ASC pyroptosome and caspase-1.  METHODS SUMMARY Assay of caspase-1 activation All cells were seeded in 35 mm 6-well plates.

The supernatant was diluted 2X with a hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitor) and then immunoprecipitaed with anti-human ASC or anti-human Omi mouse monoclonal antibodies at 4°C. The protein-antibody complexes were then precipitated with protein G-sepharose bead, and the bead-bound complexes and lysates were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunobloting with anti-AIM2 (3B10) or anti-IFI16 mouse monoclonal antibodies, or anti-ASC, anti-Omi, anti-MNDA, or anti-IFIX rabbit polyclonal antibodies. In vitro pull down assays were performed with recombinant bacterially expressed GST-tagged full length human ASC, ASC-PYD or ASC-CARD and C-terminal His6-tagged human AIM2 or AIM2-?PYD. The GST-tagged proteins were isolated from bacterial lysates by glutathione-affinity purification on glutathione-agarose beads.

Purified GST-AIM2 or ASC pyroptosomes were incubated with PYD-caspase-1-containing lysates together with pro-IL-1? in CHAPS buffer for 60 min at 37° C. The reaction mixtures were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blotting with anti-caspase-1 p30 and anti-IL-1? antibodies. In some experiments, in vitro translated 35S-labeled and nuclease treated PYD-caspase-9 (WT or C287A) was incubated with purified GST-AIM2 or ASC pyroptosomes in the presence or absence of poly (dA:dT) for 60 min at 37°C and the reaction products then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.

ASC pyroptosomes were then isolated from the lysates and cross-linked with DSS as described in detail recently 18 . Purification and cross-linking of AIM2 Full-length AIM2 with a C-terminal His6 tag was expressed in bacteria and then purified on Talon® beads (Clontech) according to standard procedures. Purified AIM2 (2 µg) was incubated with or without a 64-mer synthetic dsDNA (0.5 and 1 µg) for 15 min at room temperature in 50 µl PBS. The reaction mixtures were then cross-linked with 1 µl of 1% glutaraldehyde which covalently cross-links lysine residues in close proximity to each other in oligomeric proteins. Glutaraldehyde does not cross-link proteins to DNA. The reactions were terminated by addition of 2 µl of 2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cross-linked AIM2 was solubilized by addition of an equal volume of 2X Laemmli SDS sample buffer and fractionated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

The protein-antibody complexes were then precipitated with protein G-sepharose bead, and the bead-bound complexes and lysates were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunobloting with anti-AIM2 (3B10) or anti-IFI16 mouse monoclonal antibodies, or anti-ASC, anti-Omi, anti-MNDA, or anti-IFIX rabbit polyclonal antibodies. In vitro pull down assays were performed with recombinant bacterially expressed GST-tagged full length human ASC, ASC-PYD or ASC-CARD and C-terminal His6-tagged human AIM2 or AIM2-?PYD. The GST-tagged proteins were isolated from bacterial lysates by glutathione-affinity purification on glutathione-agarose beads. The bead-bound proteins were then incubated for 2 h at 4°C with bacterially produced His6-tagged AIM2 or AIM2-?PYD proteins. After incubation, the complexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunobloting with anti-His6-HRP antibody. Similarly GST-tagged AIM2 or AIM2-?PYD was allowed to interact with bacterially produced ASC and the bound ASC was assayed by immunobloting with anti-ASC monoclonal antibody.  Confocal microscopy The 293-ASC-EGFP-N1 or 293-AIM2-ASC-EGFP-N1 cells, or NALP3?/? macrophages were seeded on 35 mm cover glass bottom culture dishes and allowed to attach for 24 h. Next day cells were transfected with poly (dA:dT) (1 µg/dish) for 2–3 hours using Lipofectamine 2000 and then stained with Hoechst 33342 for 30 min. Cells were then observed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope. In the experiments using the Cy™3-labeled plasmid DNA, 293-hAIM2-EGFP-N1 cells or NALP3?/? -mAIM2-EGFP-N1 macrophages were seeded on 35 mm cover glass bottom culture dishes and allowed to attach for 24h. Next day cells were transfected with Cy™3-labeled plasmid DNA (0.5 µg/dish) for 2–3 hours using Lipofectamine 2000 and then stained with Hoechst 33342 for 30 min. Cells were then observed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope. The EGFP (green) was excited with the 488 nm argon laser. The nuclear Hoechst 33342 stain (blue) was excited with the 405 nm diode laser. The Cy™3 (red) was excited with the 543 nm He/Ne Laser.  <italic>In vitro</italic> caspase-1 activation and IL-1? cleavage Assays Lysates containing PYD-caspase-1 and pro-IL-1? were prepared from 293-PYD-caspase- 1 or 293-pro-IL-1? stable cell lines in CHAPS buffer (20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1 % CHAPS). GST-AIM2 or ASC pyroptosomes were produced in bacteria and purified by standard procedures 18 . Purified GST-AIM2 or ASC pyroptosomes were incubated with PYD-caspase-1-containing lysates together with pro-IL-1? in CHAPS buffer for 60 min at 37° C. The reaction mixtures were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blotting with anti-caspase-1 p30 and anti-IL-1? antibodies. In some experiments, in vitro translated 35S-labeled and nuclease treated PYD-caspase-9 (WT or C287A) was incubated with purified GST-AIM2 or ASC pyroptosomes in the presence or absence of poly (dA:dT) for 60 min at 37°C and the reaction products then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.  Pyroptosome isolation from poly (dA:dT) transfected macrophages NALP3?/? macrophages in 10 cm culture dishes were transfected with 6 µg of poly (dA:dT) or vehicle (H2O) using Lipofectamine 2000 in SF OPTI-MEM®I for 4 hours. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and then lysed in buffer A (20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH7.5, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 320 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM PMSF). ASC pyroptosomes were then isolated from the lysates and cross-linked with DSS as described in detail recently 18 .  Purification and cross-linking of AIM2 Full-length AIM2 with a C-terminal His6 tag was expressed in bacteria and then purified on Talon® beads (Clontech) according to standard procedures. Purified AIM2 (2 µg) was incubated with or without a 64-mer synthetic dsDNA (0.5 and 1 µg) for 15 min at room temperature in 50 µl PBS. The reaction mixtures were then cross-linked with 1 µl of 1% glutaraldehyde which covalently cross-links lysine residues in close proximity to each other in oligomeric proteins. Glutaraldehyde does not cross-link proteins to DNA. The reactions were terminated by addition of 2 µl of 2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cross-linked AIM2 was solubilized by addition of an equal volume of 2X Laemmli SDS sample buffer and fractionated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.
