Serum Cystatin C, Kidney Disease Markers, and the Incidence of Age-Related Macular Degeneration: The Beaver Dam Eye Study Objective To examine associations of serum cystatin C and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with the incidence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) over 15 years. Design Population based cohort study of persons 43 to 86 years of age at baseline (n=4,926), of whom 3,779 participated in one or more follow-up examinations. Methods AMD was determined by grading photographs of the macula. Persons were defined as having mild and moderate/severe CKD based on a value of > 45 to ? 60 mL/min and ? 45 mL/min per 1.73 m2, respectively, from the MDRD equation. Main Outcome Measures Incidence of AMD. Results While controlling for age and other risk factors, serum cystatin C at baseline was associated with the incidence of early AMD (Odds Ratio per log standard deviation 1.16, and 95% Confidence Interval, 1.01, 1.35), exudative AMD (1.42, 1.03, 1.94) but not geographic atrophy (0.89, 0.56, 1.41) or progression of AMD (1.02, 0.88, 1.18). Mild CKD was associated with the 15-year cumulative incidence of early AMD (1.36, 1.00, 1.86) but not the incidence of other AMD endpoints. Conclusion These findings show a relationship of serum cystatin C and CKD with the incidence of AMD. The underlying biological processes remain to be determined.

METHODS AND MATERIALS Population Methods used to identify and describe the population have appeared in previous reports. 32 - 36 In brief, a private census of the population of Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, was performed from September 15, 1987, to May 4, 1988, to identify all residents in the city or township of Beaver Dam who were 43 to 84 years of age. Of the 5,924 eligible individuals, 4,926 participated in the baseline examination between March 1, 1988, and September 14, 1990. 32 , 33 Ninety-nine percent of the population was white. Of these, 3,684 (81.1%) participated in the 5-year follow-up examination in 1993 to 1995. 34 Of the 3,334 surviving participants in the baseline and second examination, 2,764 (82.9%) participated in the 10-year follow-up examination. 35 Of the 2,480 surviving participants who were examined at the baseline, 5- and 10-year follow-up examinations, 2,119 (85.4%) participated in the 15-year follow-up examination. 36 Comparisons between participants and non-participants at the time of the baseline, 5-, 10-, and 15-year follow-up examinations have appeared elsewhere. 33 - 36 While adjusting for age and sex, and other risk factors, persons with higher levels of serum cystatin C were more likely to die (data not shown). AMD severity status did not affect the relation of serum cystatin C to participation or death (data not shown). Procedures and Definitions Similar procedures, used at both the baseline and follow-up examinations, have been described in detail elsewhere. 37 - 45 Informed consent was obtained from each participant at the beginning of the examination. Pertinent parts of the examination at both baseline and follow-up consisted of measurement of height and weight and taking stereoscopic 30? color fundus photographs centered on macula (Diabetic Retinopathy Study standard field 2). The Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System was used to assess the presence and severity of lesions associated with AMD. 38 , 39 Grading procedures, lesion descriptions, and detailed definitions for the presence and severity of specific AMD lesions have appeared elsewhere. 38 - 43 Early AMD was defined by the presence of either soft indistinct drusen or the presence of any type of drusen associated with retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) depigmentation or increased retinal pigment. Incidence of early and late AMD and component lesions were defined by their presence at follow-up in either eye when absent at the previous examination. For each eye, a six-level severity scale for AMD has been defined elsewhere. 44 In brief, the first level on the scale is equivalent to having no AMD; the next three levels on the scale involve lesions defining early AMD of increasing severity (by type, size, area of drusen, and presence of pigmentary abnormalities), while the last two levels involve lesions defining late AMD. Progression for a participant was defined as an increase in the AMD severity in either eye by two steps or more from level 1 through 3, and one step or more from level 4 or level 5 in the following AMD severity scale: Level 10 no drusen or hard drusen or small soft drusen (<125?m in diameter) only, regardless of area of involvement, and no pigmentary abnormality (increased retinal pigment or RPE depigmentation) present Level 20 hard drusen or small soft drusen (<125?m in diameter), regardless of area of involvement, with increased retinal pigment present but no RPE depigmentation present or soft drusen (?125?m in diameter) with drusen area <196,350?m2 (equivalent to a circle with a diameter of 500?m) and no pigmentary abnormalities present Level 30 soft drusen (?125?m in diameter) with drusen area <196,350?m2 and RPE depigmentation present or soft drusen (?125?m in diameter) with drusen area ?196,350?m2 with or without increased retinal pigment but no RPE depigmentation present Level 40 soft drusen (?125?m in diameter) with drusen area involvement ?196,350?m2 and RPE depigmentation present with or without increased retinal pigment. Level 50 geographic atrophy in absence of exudative macular degeneration Level 60 exudative macular degeneration with or without geographic atrophy present Casual blood specimens were obtained at each examination. An aliquot of blood was used immediately for determination of the white blood cell count. Serum BUN was measured using a coloremetric method (the Berthelot reaction) on the Technicon RA-1000 AutoAnalyzer, (Technicon Instruments, Tarrytown, NY). Gross proteinuria was determined by dipstick on a casual urine sample and defined as presence of 1+ or greater. Remaining serum was stored without preservative at -80Â°C in cryogenic vials with O-rings for up to 17 years until the vials were shipped on dry ice to the University of Minnesota laboratory for the analyses reported herein. Creatinine was measured in serum by reflectance spectrophotometry on the Vitros analyzer (Johnson & Johnson Clinical Diagnostics, Inc., Rochester, NY). The laboratory coefficient of variability (CV) was 2.2%. Serum cystatin C was determined nephelometically using the Dade Behring BN100 nephelometer (Deerfield, IL). The inter-assay precision was determined at two control levels: 1.72 mg/L (CV 6.4%) and 0.78 mg/L (CV 5.2%). Estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from serum creatinine used the validated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) prediction equation that included age, sex, and race. 46 , 47 Persons were defined as having mild CKD based on a value of > 45 to ? 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and moderate to severe CKD based on a value of ? 45 mL/min per 1.73 m2 from the MDRD equation. Cigarette smoking status was determined as follows: a subject was classified as a nonsmoker if he/she had smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in his/her lifetime; as an ex-smoker if he/she had smoked more than this number of cigarettes in his/her lifetime but had stopped smoking before the examination; and as a current smoker if he/she had not stopped smoking. Hypertension was defined as a mean systolic blood pressure of ? 140 mmHg and/or a mean diastolic blood pressure of ? 90 mmHg and/or a history of hypertension using antihypertensive medication at the time of the baseline examination. A person was defined as having diabetes if he/she had a previous history of diabetes mellitus and was treated with insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, and/or diet or was newly discovered to have diabetes at baseline. Body mass index (BMI) was defined as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters 2 . Current vitamin use was defined in three levels: no use; use of multivitamins; or use of other single or combinations of vitamins (e.g., B-complex). Statistical Methods For these analyses, we examined the relationships between serum cystatin C, creatinine, and BUN, the presence of gross proteinuria, and the presence of CKD to the incidence of early AMD, exudative AMD, geographic atrophy, and the progression of AMD. SAS software version 9 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) was used for analyzing the data. Multivariate odds ratios and 95 percent confidence intervals were calculated from discrete linear logistic hazard models. 48 These analytical approaches allowed those persons who were right censored (not seen after the 5- or 10-year examination due to death or nonparticipation) to contribute information to the estimates. 49 Models using time-varying covariates updated at each follow-up examination (i.e., for each time interval in which a subject participated, the values of the mild CKD at the beginning of the interval) were used. Analyses first controlled for age in four categories of approximately 10-year bands and sex. We considered factors related to both the renal risk factors and AMD endpoints (e.g., smoking history, white blood cell count, BMI, vitamin use, and sedentary life style) as potential confounders in multivariate analyses. Characteristics such as stroke, coronary heart disease, poor general health, and biochemical endpoints that were not related to both independent renal risk factors and incident AMD endpoints in our study were not included as confounders. The distributions of cystatin C, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen were highly skewed so we modeled these after log-transforming the variables. We present odds ratios as a per standard deviation increase in the risk factor for continuous measures. Interactions were only tested for cystatin C and AMD status with CKD status (none, mild/severe).

Interactions were only tested for cystatin C and AMD status with CKD status (none, mild/severe).  RESULTS Baseline Characteristics Baseline characteristics of participants included and not included in analyses are described in Table 1 . Persons without AMD incidence data were more likely to be older and while controlling for age, were more likely to be a current smoker, have a higher white blood cell count, higher mean serum cystatin C, to have mild or severe CKD, and less likely to have early AMD or hypertension at baseline than participants included in analyses. Relationships of serum cystatin C, serum BUN, gross proteinuria, and CKD to sex and age are presented in Table 2 . With the exception of gross proteinuria, all increased with age. After controlling for age, men had higher levels of serum cystatin C and BUN than women ( P <.001 for all associations). Also, men had higher frequency than women of proteinuria ( P <.001) and a lower frequency than women of CKD ( P =<.001). Cumulative Incidence of AMD Of the 2,825 persons at risk, there were 392 persons who developed incident early AMD. Of the 3,503 persons at risk, there were 63 persons who developed incident exudative AMD. Of the 3,489 persons at risk, there were 39 persons who developed geographic atrophy. Of the 3,505 persons at risk, there were 400 persons whose AMD progressed. The 15-year cumulative incidence of early AMD was 14.3%, for pure geographic atrophy it was 1.3%, for exudative AMD it was 2.0% and for the progression of AMD it was 12.2%. The prevalence and 15-year cumulative incidence and progression of AMD were similar in men and women and increased with age (data not shown). 40 - 42 Serum Blood Urea Nitrogen, Serum Cystatin C, Gross Proteinuria, CKD and the Incidence of AMD While controlling for age and sex, smoking status, white blood cell count, body mass index, history of vitamin use, serum BUN, and the presence of gross proteinuria were not associated with the 15-year cumulative incidence of early AMD, exudative AMD and pure geographic atrophy or the progression of AMD ( Table 3 ). Mild CKD was associated with the 15-year cumulative incidence of early AMD but not the incidence of exudative AMD and pure geographic atrophy or the progression of AMD ( Table 3 ). Using time depending covariate analyses, we found a similar relations of mild CKD with the 5-year incidence of early AMD (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.01, 1.81; P =.04). For the first period (baseline to 5-yr follow-up, n=272), persons with mild CKD at baseline and at risk of developing AMD, the OR was 1.63 (95% CI 1.08, 2.46; P =.02); for the second period (5-yr to 10-yr follow-up, n=177), persons with mild CKD at baseline and at risk of developing AMD, the OR was 1.65 (95% CI 0.96, 2.84; P =.07), while the third period (10-yr to 15-yr follow-up, n=120), persons with mild CKD at baseline and still at risk of developing AMD, the OR was 0.34 (95% CI 0.10, 1.13; P =.08). Using time dependent covariate analyses, we found no relation of mild CKD with the 5-year incidence of exudative AMD and geographic atrophy and the progression of AMD (data not shown). Serum cystatin C was associated with the 15-year cumulative incidence of early AMD and exudative AMD but not with the incidence of geographic atrophy or progression of AMD ( Table 3 ). While controlling for other risk factors, serum cystatin C was associated with the incidence of exudative AMD in persons without CKD (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.10, 2.82; P= .02) but not in those with CKD (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.67, 2.01; P= .59, P -interaction=.40), while the associations of serum cystatin C with early AMD in persons with CKD (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86, 1.46; P =.41) and those without CKD (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.90, 1.31, P =.40, P -interaction =0.79) did not reach statistical significance.  RESULTS Baseline Characteristics Baseline characteristics of participants included and not included in analyses are described in Table 1 . Persons without AMD incidence data were more likely to be older and while controlling for age, were more likely to be a current smoker, have a higher white blood cell count, higher mean serum cystatin C, to have mild or severe CKD, and less likely to have early AMD or hypertension at baseline than participants included in analyses. Relationships of serum cystatin C, serum BUN, gross proteinuria, and CKD to sex and age are presented in Table 2 . With the exception of gross proteinuria, all increased with age. After controlling for age, men had higher levels of serum cystatin C and BUN than women ( P <.001 for all associations). Also, men had higher frequency than women of proteinuria ( P <.001) and a lower frequency than women of CKD ( P =<.001).

While controlling for other risk factors, serum cystatin C was associated with the incidence of exudative AMD in persons without CKD (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.10, 2.82; P= .02) but not in those with CKD (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.67, 2.01; P= .59, P -interaction=.40), while the associations of serum cystatin C with early AMD in persons with CKD (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86, 1.46; P =.41) and those without CKD (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.90, 1.31, P =.40, P -interaction =0.79) did not reach statistical significance.

While controlling for other risk factors, serum cystatin C was associated with the incidence of exudative AMD in persons without CKD (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.10, 2.82; P= .02) but not in those with CKD (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.67, 2.01; P= .59, P -interaction=.40), while the associations of serum cystatin C with early AMD in persons with CKD (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86, 1.46; P =.41) and those without CKD (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.90, 1.31, P =.40, P -interaction =0.79) did not reach statistical significance.  Serum Blood Urea Nitrogen, Serum Cystatin C, Gross Proteinuria, CKD and the Incidence of AMD While controlling for age and sex, smoking status, white blood cell count, body mass index, history of vitamin use, serum BUN, and the presence of gross proteinuria were not associated with the 15-year cumulative incidence of early AMD, exudative AMD and pure geographic atrophy or the progression of AMD ( Table 3 ). Mild CKD was associated with the 15-year cumulative incidence of early AMD but not the incidence of exudative AMD and pure geographic atrophy or the progression of AMD ( Table 3 ). Using time depending covariate analyses, we found a similar relations of mild CKD with the 5-year incidence of early AMD (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.01, 1.81; P =.04). For the first period (baseline to 5-yr follow-up, n=272), persons with mild CKD at baseline and at risk of developing AMD, the OR was 1.63 (95% CI 1.08, 2.46; P =.02); for the second period (5-yr to 10-yr follow-up, n=177), persons with mild CKD at baseline and at risk of developing AMD, the OR was 1.65 (95% CI 0.96, 2.84; P =.07), while the third period (10-yr to 15-yr follow-up, n=120), persons with mild CKD at baseline and still at risk of developing AMD, the OR was 0.34 (95% CI 0.10, 1.13; P =.08). Using time dependent covariate analyses, we found no relation of mild CKD with the 5-year incidence of exudative AMD and geographic atrophy and the progression of AMD (data not shown). Serum cystatin C was associated with the 15-year cumulative incidence of early AMD and exudative AMD but not with the incidence of geographic atrophy or progression of AMD ( Table 3 ). While controlling for other risk factors, serum cystatin C was associated with the incidence of exudative AMD in persons without CKD (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.10, 2.82; P= .02) but not in those with CKD (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.67, 2.01; P= .59, P -interaction=.40), while the associations of serum cystatin C with early AMD in persons with CKD (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86, 1.46; P =.41) and those without CKD (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.90, 1.31, P =.40, P -interaction =0.79) did not reach statistical significance.  Discussion In the Beaver Dam Eye Study, while controlling for age, sex, smoking status, and other risk factors, a higher serum level of cystatin C was associated with increased risk of incident early AMD and exudative AMD. The effect was stronger for incident exudative AMD in those without CKD compared to those with CKD, suggesting that this relationship might not be due to kidney related processes. To our knowledge, there are no other published papers from population-based studies examining the relation of cystatin C with the incidence of AMD. The underlying reasons for our finding are not known. Cystatin C is ubiquitous in the body, including the human RPE. 50 Cystatin C is an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases (e.g., such as the cathepsins B, L, and S) found in the eye. 51 - 53 Cathepsins have been hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenesis of AMD. 54 Data from cell culture and animal studies suggest cathepsins may maintain homeostasis of the retinal photoreceptors and the extracellular environment of Bruchâs membrane, including the release of anti-angiogenic endostatins from Bruchâs membrane collagen XVIII. 55 - 57 Im and Kazlauskas have hypothesized that high levels of cystatin C may have both deleterious and protective affects on the angiogenic response in the eye through it regulation of cathepsins. 58 The deleterious effect of a high serum cystatin C level is postulated to be due to its reduction of the protective effect of cathepsins have in the release of anti-neogenic endostatins from Bruchâs membrane collagen, resulting in higher risk of exudative AMD. This is consistent with our findings. A protective effect of higher cellular levels of cystatin C is hypothesized to be due to its suppression of the vasculogenic effect of cathepsins at the level of the endothelium. This is consistent with the fact that B precursor cystatin C CST3 genotype variant on chromosome 20, thought to result in lower levels of cystatin C in the RPE, is related to a higher risk of earlier onset of exudative AMD in humans. 59 However, to our knowledge, there are no data that show that higher levels of serum cystatin C are associated with higher RPE cellular levels of cystatin C and that the latter result in changes in level and function of cathepsins in the aged human retina. We had hypothesized that CKD and its markers, including cystatin C, would be associated with increased risk of incident AMD. This was based on an earlier finding by us that CFH Y402H (1277T?C) genotype status was related to both progression of AMD and incidence of CKD. 16 We speculated that CKD would be associated through systemic inflammation and oxidative stress with an increase in the risk of incident AMD. In the Beaver Dam Eye Study, we found a statistically significant relation of mild CKD with the incidence of early AMD but not with exudative AMD or geographic atrophy or the progression of AMD. This is consistent with data from two earlier studies that have examined these relationships. 26 , 27 The Blue Mountains Eye Study that showed after adjusting for age, sex, and other risk factors, persons with moderate CKD were 3 times as likely to develop early AMD than persons with no or mild CKD (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.8, 5.7; P < .001). 27 When using the same definition of CKD (based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation 60 ) as used in the Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES), while controlling for other factors in a multivariable model, we found a relation of CKD to incident early AMD (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.10, 2.11; P =.01) but not to incident exudative AMD (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.68, 2.66; P =.37). There are many strengths of our study, including its high participation rate, long length of follow-up, and use of standardized protocols to measure CKD risk factors and AMD endpoints. However, any conclusions or explanations regarding associations or lack of them, described herein, must be made with caution for a number of reasons. First, the concomitant low frequency of some risk factors (e.g., CKD) and of the incidence of some lesions (e.g., pure geographic atrophy) limit our ability to detect (or reject) meaningful relations. Second, some findings which may be of potential biological significance may be entirely due to chance given the number of associations examined. Third, it is also possible that we did not find significant relationships between some risk factors and AMD because persons with these factors (e.g., CKD) who developed AMD did not live to participate in the follow-up examination. However, nonparticipation due to death is probably unlikely to bias our findings because AMD had not been shown to be associated with mortality in the Beaver Dam Eye Study cohort. 61 In addition, time-dependent covariate modeling for CKD showed similar strengths of association for CKD as those reported for the 15-year cumulative incidence of these endpoints. Fourth, there may be misclassification of CKD. This might be expected to bias the results to the null. Fifth, there may be uncontrolled confounding. In summary, the data from the Beaver Dam Eye Study show an association of serum cystatin C and CKD with the incidence of AMD, independent of smoking and other risk factors. Confirmation of these findings in other studies and a better understanding of the biological processes underlying our findings are needed.
