The chemokine receptors CCR2 and CX3CR1 mediate monocyte/macrophage trafficking in kidney ischemia–reperfusion injury Chemokines and their receptors such as CCR2 and CX3CR1 mediate leukocyte adhesion and migration into injured tissue. To further define mechanisms of monocyte trafficking during kidney injury we identified two groups of F4/80-positive cells (F4/80low and F4/80high) in the normal mouse kidney that phenotypically correspond to macrophages and dendritic cells, respectively. Following ischemia and 3 h of reperfusion, there was a large influx of F4/80low inflamed monocytes, but not dendritic cells, into the kidney. These monocytes produced TNF-?, IL-6, IL-1 ? and IL-12. Ischemic injury induced in CCR2?/? mice or in CCR2+/+ mice, made chimeric with CCR2?/? bone marrow, resulted in lower plasma creatinine levels and their kidneys had fewer infiltrated F4/80low macrophages compared to control mice. CX3CR1 expression contributed to monocyte recruitment into inflamed kidneys, as ischemic injury in CX3CR1?/? mice was reduced, with fewer F4/80low macrophages than controls. Monocytes transferred from CCR2+/+ or CX3CR1+/? mice migrated into reperfused kidneys better than monocytes from either CCR2?/? or CX3CR1?/? mice. Adoptive transfer of monocytes from CCR2+/+ mice, but not CCR2?/? mice, reversed the protective effect in CCR2?/? mice following ischemia-reperfusion. Egress of CD11b+Ly6Chigh monocytes from blood into inflamed kidneys was CCR2- and CX3CR1-dependent. Our study shows that inflamed monocyte migration, through CCR2- and CX3CR1-dependent mechanisms, plays a critical role in kidney injury following ischemia reperfusion.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice and surgical protocol We adhered to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The Animal Research Committee of the University of Virginia approved all procedures and protocols. We used C57BL/6 and Balb/c male background mice (~20 g, 6–8 weeks of age; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA). Age-matched CCR2?/? mice (Balb/c background), CX3CR1+/GFP and CX3CR1GFP/GFP mice (C57BL/6 background) were bred in our animal facility. Following anesthesia, bilateral flank incisions were performed as previously described, 32 both kidney pedicles were exposed and cross-clamped for 32 min, then clamps were released (reperfusion) for different times. In sham-operated mice, kidney pedicles were exposed but not clamped. Tissue processing and cell counting by FACS Kidney cell pellets were prepared from sham and IRI mice and kidney leukocyte subset cell number was calculated as described. 28 Kidney F4/80+ cell subsets were identified using allophycocyanin (APC)-labeled rat anti-mouse F4/80 (BM8) and phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled rat anti-mouse CD11b (M1/70), I-A (M5/114.15.2), CD11c (N418), CD86 (GL1), TLR2 (6C2), Ly6C (AL-21; BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA), Gr-1 (Ly6G) (RB6-8C5), CD62L (MEL-14), very late antigen-4 (HMb1-1), or lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (M17/4) antibodies, or primary rabbit anti-mouse CX3CR1 antibody followed by PE-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA). Fresh mouse blood and BM cells were obtained. 14 Cell pellets were incubated with anti-CD11b-PE (M1/70), F4/80-APC (BM8) and Ly6C-FITC (AL-21). 7-AAD was used to exclude dead cells. Flow cytometry data acquisition was performed on BD FACSCalibur and analyzed by Flowjo software 6.4 (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). Intracellular staining of proinflammatory cytokines FACS intracellular staining of proinflammatory cytokines was performed as described. 28 PE-labeled anti-mouse IL-1? (ALF-161), IL-6 (MP5-20F3), IL-12p40/70 (C17.8), TNF-? (MP6-XT22), or isotype control antibody (5 µg/ml) was added to each sample after blocking with anti-mouse CD16/32 (10 mg/ml) for 20 min on ice. All of above mAbs, unless otherwise stated, were from eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA). Generation of chimeric mice Two groups of chimeric mice were generated by transferring BM cells as described. 33 (1) BM from CCR2?/? to CCR2+/+ mice (CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+) and (2) BM from CCR2+/+ to CCR2+/+ mice (CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+). Chimeric mice were used 8 weeks after BM transfer. Reconstitution efficiency is nearly 90%. 32 , 33 BM monocyte isolation and adoptive transfer BM CFSE labeling and monocyte isolation was as described before. 22 The enriched population comprised 90% CD11b+ cells. CFSE-labeled enriched monocytes (1 × 107) were injected i.v. into CCR2?/? mice at the onset of kidney IRI. Histochemistry Kidneys were fixed for hematoxylin and eosin staining, and acute tubular necrosis was scored in the outer stripe of the outer medulla as described previously. 34 Sections were viewed by light microscopy (Zeiss AxioSkop), and photographs were taken with a SPOT-RT camera (software version 3.3; Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI, USA). Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy Mouse kidney sections were fixed in 0.7% PLP (0.7% paraformaldehyde), 1.4% lysine, 0.2% sodium periodate in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH7.4, 32 incubated in 30% sucrose for 48 h at 4 °C, embedded and frozen in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, USA). Frozen sections (25 µm) were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, blocked with 10% goat serum and anti-CD16/32 antibody, and incubated for 1 h with Alexa 647-labeled F4/80 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or IA (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) or PE-labeled I-A (eBioscience, Carlsbad, CA, USA) antibodies (5 µg/ml). Images were acquired using Zeiss LSM 510-UV confocal microscopy and processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA). Statistics GraphPad Instat 3 (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used to analyze the data.

Further phenotyping of these two F4/80+ populations showed that the F4/80low cells expressed ( c ) CX3CR1low and only this population, but not the F4/80high population, expressed ( b ) CD62L, Ly6Chigh, and Gr-1int (oval circled).

All leukocytes from sham and IRI kidneys of equal weight were counted and evaluated by FACS (see ‘ Materials and Methods ’). Results clearly indicated that there was an increase in total number of CD45+ leukocytes in IRI kidneys at ( a , right) 3 h and ( b , right) 24 h when compared to respective sham-operated mice.

( a ) Some of the Ly6Chigh monocytes lose their CCR2 and Ly6C expression and are further characterized with CD62L?, Gr-1? and CX3CR1high. ( b ) These cells migrate to normal noninflamed tissue rapidly after they are released in the blood and differentiate into tissue dendritic cells (DCs), which express CD11b+, CD11c+, IAhigh, CD86+ and F4/80high. ( c ) On the other hand, some of the monocytes continue to express CCR2+ and Ly6Chigh on the cell surface with the additional expression of CX3CR1low, Gr-1int, and CD62L+. ( d ) These inflamed monocytes respond to the gradient of chemokines ( e ) released from IRI kidneys. In the injured tissue, these macrophages derived from inflamed monocytes are characterized by CD62L+, Gr-1int, Ly6C+, and F4/80low expression. Infiltrated macrophages produce large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, which are involved in tissue injury.

RESULTS F4/80<sup>+</sup> leukocytes are abundantly expressed in normal mouse kidneys and their numbers increase rapidly following kidney IR Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry revealed that F4/80-positive (F4/80+) cells were the most abundant resting leukocyte population, constituting ~50% of the CD45+ population in normal kidneys ( Figure S1a and b ). We next examined the effect of kidney IR on the time course of F4/80+ infiltration relative to other leukocytes ( Figure S1c ). Although at baseline the F4/80+ cell population was the most abundant leukocyte subset, at 30 min of reperfusion there was no increase in infiltration of F4/80+ cells above sham. At 1 h of reperfusion, the number of F4/80+ cells (macrophages) increased significantly, peaking at 24 h, and persisting for at least 7 days following reperfusion. There are two macrophage subtypes in the kidney with distinct phenotypes Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis identified two subsets of F4/80+ cells in normal mouse kidneys, CD11blowF4/80high (referred to as F4/80high) and CD11bhighF4/80low (F4/80low) cells, based on the F4/80 and CD11b fluorescence intensity ( Figure 1a ). The F4/80high cells comprised ~40% of the total leukocyte (CD45+) population and represented the major leukocyte population within normal mouse kidneys. Using monocyte, DC, chemokine receptor, adhesion and toll-like receptor (TLR) markers these two F4/80+ subsets had distinct phenotypes ( Figure 1b–d ; Table 1 ). All F4/80low cells expressed CD62L+, Ly6Chigh, Gr-1int ( Figure 2b ), and CX3CR1low ( Figure 2c ), a phenotype characteristic of the blood inflamed monocyte. 7 , 8 All F4/80high cells expressed CD11c+, MHC class IIhigh (IAhigh), CD86+, and CX3CR1high ( Figure 1c ), a phenotype characteristic of DCs. Both subsets expressed lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1, very late antigen-4, TLR2, MD-1 ( Figure 1d ), and RP-105 (not shown). Therefore, F4/80high cells and F4/80low cells were considered to represent kidney resident DCs and macrophages derived from the inflamed monocyte pool, respectively. As both kidney F4/80+ subsets express CX3CR1, we used CX3CR1+/GFP mice to track macrophages and DCs in normal kidney. Targeted deletion of CX3CR1 and replacement with the gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) provides a useful means for following labeled cells and for studying the function of CX3CR1. GFP is expressed in all CX3CR1+/GFP and homozygous CX3CR1GFP/GFP circulating CD11b+F4/80+ cells. 7 , 19 , 20 Most of the kidney CX3CR1 GFP+ DCs are resident DCs and are distributed throughout the cortex ( Figure 1e ) and outer medulla ( Figure 1f ), consistent with a recent report. 21 MHC II (IA) distribution was mainly in the kidney medulla ( Figure 1f ), compared to cortex ( Figure 1e ), and most GFP+ cells expressed IA ( Figure 1e–g ) and F4/80 on the cell surface ( Figure 1h ). DCs comprised 85% of the GFP+ cells ( Figure 1i ). All of the CX3CR1+GFPhigh cells expressed CD11b, and most expressed CD11c and MHC II, markers for DCs ( Figure 1i ). Ly6C and Gr-1 were expressed primarily on the GFPlow population ( Figure 1j ), which has the same phenotype as the blood inflamed monocytes. 7 Both GFP+ cell populations expressed F4/80 ( Figure 1h and j ). Kidney F4/80low leukocytes had a similar phenotype to GFPlow cells in CX3CR1+/GFP mice and represented kidney monocyte/macrophages, whereas the F4/80high subset resemble CX3CR1+ GFPhigh cells and represented resident kidney DCs ( Figure 1b and c ). Recruitment of F4/80<sup>low</sup> macrophage subset following kidney IRI Following 3 ( Figure 2a and g ) and 24 h ( Figure 2b and h ) of reperfusion FACS analysis showed an increase in the cell number of F4/80low macrophages. However, 3 ( Figure 2a and g ) and 24 h ( Figure 2b and h ) after reperfusion there was no change in the number of F4/80high kidney resident DCs. Similar results were observed with Ly6Chigh and Gr-1int markers expressed on the blood inflamed monocytes, at 3 ( Figure 2c and e ) and 24 h ( Figure 2d and f ). At 3 h following reperfusion, recruited F4/80low macrophages were Ly6Chigh ( Figure 2c ), which represents immature, newly arrived monocytes from BM. 8 By 24 h, Ly6C expression was markedly downregulated in the F4/80low monocytes ( Figure 2d ); the values for mean fluorescence index were 2243.3 ± 134.2 ( n = 3) and 768.0 ± 47.4 ( n = 3) for 3 and 24 h IRI, respectively ( P < 0.001). This finding suggests that either macrophages mature after migration to the inflamed kidney or mature macrophages infiltrate IRI kidneys. Similarly, the number of F4/80lowGr-1int macrophages in kidneys increased at 3 h ( Figure 2e ) and was greater (relative to sham) by 24 h of reperfusion ( Figure 2f , right). The mean fluorescence index of F4/80lowGr-1int decreased at 24 h compared to 3 h following kidney IRI, paralleling the findings with Ly6C. Therefore, an abundance of infiltrating macro-phages, phenotypically similar to circulating inflamed monocytes, was identified in reperfused kidneys. Heterogeneity of proinflammatory cytokine production by CD11b<sup>high</sup>F4/80<sup>low</sup> and CD11b<sup>high</sup>F4/80<sup>high</sup> 24 h following kidney IRI We used FACS analysis of intracellular cytokine production to determine functional differences between F4/80low and F4/80high populations following kidney IRI. Gating on F4/80low and F4/80high ( Figure 2b ) macrophages from 24 h sham and IRI kidney, we determined expression of intracellular interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, IL-12p40/70, and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-? ( Figure 3a and b ). The proportion of F4/80low macrophages producing cytokines (% of total F4/80low population) following IRI was 4- to 8-fold greater for IRI relative to sham ( Figure 3a and c ). In contrast, the percentage of F4/80high cells ( Figure 3b and d ) that produced IL-1?, IL-6, IL-12p40/70 was unchanged but TNF-?-producing cells increased significantly following IRI compared to sham. Therefore, 24 h following reperfusion, FACS analysis reveals functional differences between F4/80low and F4/80high populations. CCR2-deficient, but not MCP-1-deficient, signaling protects kidneys from IRI Chemokine production attracts monocytes, T cells, and neutrophils to the reperfused kidney. Compared with sham mouse kidneys, expression of RANTES, MIP-2, IP-10, and MCP-1 mRNA increased at 24 h after IRI (data not shown). As CCR2/MCP-1 is an important signaling pathway in mediating monocyte/macrophage migration, we performed kidney IRI in mice deficient in CCR2 (CCR2?/?) or its ligand, MCP-1 (MCP-1?/?). Following 24 h of reperfusion, plasma creatinine levels increased significantly in CCR2+/+ but not in CCR2?/? mice ( Figure 4a ). To determine the contribution of CCR2 expressed on bone marrow (BM)-derived cells to tissue injury following reperfusion, we generated BM chimeras by transferring BM-derived cells from CCR2?/? mice into BM-depleted CCR2+/+ mice (CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+). IRI led to an increase in plasma creatinine in CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ but not in CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 4b ). Tubule cell necrosis in the kidney outer medulla was lower in CCR2?/? mice following IRI compared to CCR2+/+ mice (acute tubular necrosis score: 0.5 ± 0.1 vs 4.5 ± 0.3, P < 0.0001) ( Figure 4c and d ) and in CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ compared with CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+ chimeras (acute tubular necrosis score: 0.6 ± 0.4 vs 4.4 ± 0.3, P < 0.0001) ( Figure 4e and f ). In contrast, the kidneys of MCP-1?/? mice were not protected from IRI; plasma creatinine levels were 2.20 ± 0.13 ( n = 5) and 0.27 ± 0.02 ( n = 4) mg/100 ml for IRI and sham, respectively ( P < 0.001) and more F4/80low macrophages infiltrated injured tissue in MCP-1?/? mice. Although F4/80lowLy6C+ cell counts were similar between sham-operated WT and MCP?/? mice, F4/80low Ly6C+ cell counts ( × 105 cells per g kidney) increased to a similar degree in WT ( n = 3) and KO ( n = 3) mice following IRI (2.42 ± 0.31 and 2.57 ± 0.12, respectively, P = NS). This is probably due to the contribution of other MCP family members to kidney IRI. We evaluated the function of CCR2 expression in mediating F4/80low macrophage recruitment to injured kidneys. Following 24 h of reperfusion, CD11b+F4/80low macrophages increased in kidneys of CCR2+/+ mice and CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 4g ). However, the absence of CCR2 attenuated the increase in F4/80low macrophages in CCR2?/? mice and CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 4g ). Similar results were observed with other markers of F4/80lowLy6C+ macrophages and F4/80lowGr-1int macrophages (not shown). Interestingly, the number of F4/80high kidney resident DCs did not increase in CCR2+/+, CCR2?/?, CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+, or CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ mice following 24 h of reperfusion compared to sham (data not shown). Thus, CCR2 expressed on BM-derived cells mediates F4/80low monocyte/macrophage infiltration into reperfused kidneys. The infiltration of neutrophils in kidneys subjected to IRI in relation to macrophage recruitment was also examined. In CCR2?/? and CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ mice, neutrophils comigrated with macrophages into injured kidneys. Kidney neutrophil cell number ( × 105 per g kidney) following IRI was 2.79 ± 0.23 ( n = 4) and 10.87 ± 1.78 ( n = 4) ( P < 0.005) for CCR2?/? and CCR2+/+, respectively, and 3.46 ± 1.55 ( n = 8) and 13.28 ± 2.31 ( n = 10) ( P < 0.005) for CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ and CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+, respectively. These results suggested that CCR2 also mediated neutrophil recruitment to inflamed kidneys. Deficiency of CX3CR1 reduces kidney IRI CX3CR1 is another chemokine receptor mediating monocyte migration. Following kidney IRI, an increase in plasma creatinine levels was observed in CX3CR1+/GFP mice, but levels were significantly lower in CX3CR1-deficient CX3CR1GFP/GFP mice ( Figure 5a ). Tubule necrosis produced by IRI was also attenuated in CX3CR1GFP/GFP compared with CX3CR1+/GFP mice (acute tubular necrosis score: 2.0 ± 0.74 vs 4.1 ± 0.22, P < 0.05) ( Figure 5b ). Monocyte infiltration of the reperfused kidney is CX3CR1 dependent To test our hypothesis that monocyte recruitment to the reperfused kidney is CX3CR1 dependent, we examined the kidney CX3CR1+ GFPlowGr-1+ and CX3CR1+ GFPlowLy6C+ macrophages in CX3CR1GFP/GFP (CX3CR1 KO) and CX3CR1+/GFP mice 7 following reperfusion ( Figure 5c and d ). We found increased CX3CR1+ GFPlow Gr-1+ macrophage infiltration (cell number, × 105 per g kidney) into reperfused kidneys of CX3CR1+/GFP mice (1.64 ± 0.51 ( n = 7) and 6.86 ± 1.35 ( n = 11) for sham and IRI, respectively ( P < 0.01)) but not in CX3CR1GFP/GFP mice (1.20 ± 0.28 ( n = 6) and 2.21 ± 0.29 ( n = 10) for sham and IRI, respectively ( P > 0.05)). Similar results were found for CX3CR1+ GFPlow Ly6C+ macrophages ( Figure 5d ). The increase from sham following IRI (%) was 316.9 ± 117.5 ( n = 5) and 78.8 ± 39.5 for CX3CR1+/GFP and CX3CR1GFP/GFP ( n = 9), respectively ( P < 0.05). These results indicate that CX3CR1 is important in monocyte/macrophage recruitment following IRI. Infiltrating F4/80<sup>low</sup> macrophages in reperfused kidneys were derived from a blood CD11b<sup>high</sup> Ly6C<sup>high</sup> inflamed monocyte pool Kidney-recruited F4/80low macrophages following IRI ex-pressed Ly6Chigh, Gr-1int and CD62L, markers characteristic of blood-derived inflamed monocytes ( Figure S2 ). The percentage of CD11b+Ly6Chigh monocytes in blood increased as early as 3 h after kidney IRI (4.45 ± 0.85; n = 12) compared with sham (1.72 ± 0.28; n = 12) ( P < 0.01). Because CCR2 is necessary for monocyte trafficking into reperfused kidneys, we examined the function of CCR2 on the blood content of CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes ( Figure 6a ) after kidney IRI. We found increased blood CD11b+ Ly6-Chigh cells in 24 h IRI CCR2+/+ mice compared with sham but not in CCR2?/? mice. We also found that following IRI the percentage (and absolute cell counts; not shown) of blood CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes increased in the CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ but not in the CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 6a ). These results suggest that CCR2 deficiency leads to reduced influx of Ly6Chigh inflamed monocytes into the reperfused kidney due to a reduced blood content of Ly6Chigh inflamed monocytes in CCR2?/? mice and CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras. We next examined whether the reduction of blood CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes in CCR2?/? mice was due to the retention of CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes in BM. After 24 h of kidney reperfusion, CCR2+/+ and CCR2?/? mice had a similar percentage of BM Ly6Chigh monocytes, and the percentage change of BM Ly6Chigh cells in CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ chimeras was similar to CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras following IRI ( Figure 6b ). These findings demonstrated that following kidney IRI, blood CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes are reduced in CCR2?/? mice and could contribute to a diminished blood to kidney tissue gradient. This could contribute to reduced monocyte/macrophage infiltration and tissue protection observed in CCR2?/? mice following IRI. CCR2 and CX3CR1 are necessary for inflamed monocyte migration to the IRI kidney The observed decrease in kidney infiltration of monocytes into reperfused kidneys may be due to: (1) the reduced blood content of monocytes in the CCR2?/? mice (hence reduced gradient from blood to kidney) or (2) the necessity of CCR2 expression on monocytes to facilitate migration from blood to the injured kidney. To distinguish between these two possibilities we transferred the same number (1 × 107) of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled BM monocytes either from CCR2+/+ or CCR2?/? mice to CCR2?/? mice at the onset of kidney IRI and tracked their infiltration into CCR2?/? kidneys subjected to IR ( Figure 6c and d ). CFSE-labeled CCR2+/+ monocytes were detected in reperfused kidneys and comprised primarily the F4/80low population. There was a threefold greater influx of CFSE-labeled CCR2+/+ monocytes in CCR2?/? IRI kidney compared to CFSE-labeled CCR2?/? monocytes. Similarly, we adoptively transferred CX3CR1GFP/GFP or CX3CR1+/GFP BM monocytes into WT mice ( Figure 6e and f ). CX3CR1+/GFP monocytes were detected in reperfused kidneys and com-prised primarily the F4/80low population. There was a 3.2-fold greater influx of CX3CR1+/GFP monocytes into the reperfused kidneys of WTmice compared to CX3CR1GFP/GFP monocytes. The protected kidney function in CCR2?/? mice was reversed following adoptive transfer of CCR2+/+ (1 × 107) but not CCR2?/? monocytes. Creatinine level following IRI was 0.81 ± 0.11 ( n = 4) and 0.51 ± 0.03 ( n = 6) mg/100 ml for CCR2?/? mice that received CCR2+/+ and CCR2?/? monocytes, respectively ( P < 0.05). These data demonstrated that monocytes expressing CCR2 represent inflamed monocytes that migrate to the IRI kidney and contribute to tissue injury in a CCR2-dependent manner. The data from these two experiments provide strong evidence that the protection observed following reperfusion in CCR2- and CX3CR1-deficient mice is due to a reduced CCR2- and CX3CR1-dependant infiltration of F4/80low macrophages and that the reduced infiltration into reperfused kidneys is due to the combined effect of reduced emigration of monocytes from BM (CCR2?/? mice) and reduced migration of monocytes into injured kidneys.  RESULTS F4/80<sup>+</sup> leukocytes are abundantly expressed in normal mouse kidneys and their numbers increase rapidly following kidney IR Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry revealed that F4/80-positive (F4/80+) cells were the most abundant resting leukocyte population, constituting ~50% of the CD45+ population in normal kidneys ( Figure S1a and b ). We next examined the effect of kidney IR on the time course of F4/80+ infiltration relative to other leukocytes ( Figure S1c ). Although at baseline the F4/80+ cell population was the most abundant leukocyte subset, at 30 min of reperfusion there was no increase in infiltration of F4/80+ cells above sham. At 1 h of reperfusion, the number of F4/80+ cells (macrophages) increased significantly, peaking at 24 h, and persisting for at least 7 days following reperfusion. There are two macrophage subtypes in the kidney with distinct phenotypes Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis identified two subsets of F4/80+ cells in normal mouse kidneys, CD11blowF4/80high (referred to as F4/80high) and CD11bhighF4/80low (F4/80low) cells, based on the F4/80 and CD11b fluorescence intensity ( Figure 1a ). The F4/80high cells comprised ~40% of the total leukocyte (CD45+) population and represented the major leukocyte population within normal mouse kidneys. Using monocyte, DC, chemokine receptor, adhesion and toll-like receptor (TLR) markers these two F4/80+ subsets had distinct phenotypes ( Figure 1b–d ; Table 1 ). All F4/80low cells expressed CD62L+, Ly6Chigh, Gr-1int ( Figure 2b ), and CX3CR1low ( Figure 2c ), a phenotype characteristic of the blood inflamed monocyte. 7 , 8 All F4/80high cells expressed CD11c+, MHC class IIhigh (IAhigh), CD86+, and CX3CR1high ( Figure 1c ), a phenotype characteristic of DCs. Both subsets expressed lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1, very late antigen-4, TLR2, MD-1 ( Figure 1d ), and RP-105 (not shown). Therefore, F4/80high cells and F4/80low cells were considered to represent kidney resident DCs and macrophages derived from the inflamed monocyte pool, respectively. As both kidney F4/80+ subsets express CX3CR1, we used CX3CR1+/GFP mice to track macrophages and DCs in normal kidney. Targeted deletion of CX3CR1 and replacement with the gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) provides a useful means for following labeled cells and for studying the function of CX3CR1. GFP is expressed in all CX3CR1+/GFP and homozygous CX3CR1GFP/GFP circulating CD11b+F4/80+ cells. 7 , 19 , 20 Most of the kidney CX3CR1 GFP+ DCs are resident DCs and are distributed throughout the cortex ( Figure 1e ) and outer medulla ( Figure 1f ), consistent with a recent report. 21 MHC II (IA) distribution was mainly in the kidney medulla ( Figure 1f ), compared to cortex ( Figure 1e ), and most GFP+ cells expressed IA ( Figure 1e–g ) and F4/80 on the cell surface ( Figure 1h ). DCs comprised 85% of the GFP+ cells ( Figure 1i ). All of the CX3CR1+GFPhigh cells expressed CD11b, and most expressed CD11c and MHC II, markers for DCs ( Figure 1i ). Ly6C and Gr-1 were expressed primarily on the GFPlow population ( Figure 1j ), which has the same phenotype as the blood inflamed monocytes. 7 Both GFP+ cell populations expressed F4/80 ( Figure 1h and j ). Kidney F4/80low leukocytes had a similar phenotype to GFPlow cells in CX3CR1+/GFP mice and represented kidney monocyte/macrophages, whereas the F4/80high subset resemble CX3CR1+ GFPhigh cells and represented resident kidney DCs ( Figure 1b and c ). Recruitment of F4/80<sup>low</sup> macrophage subset following kidney IRI Following 3 ( Figure 2a and g ) and 24 h ( Figure 2b and h ) of reperfusion FACS analysis showed an increase in the cell number of F4/80low macrophages. However, 3 ( Figure 2a and g ) and 24 h ( Figure 2b and h ) after reperfusion there was no change in the number of F4/80high kidney resident DCs. Similar results were observed with Ly6Chigh and Gr-1int markers expressed on the blood inflamed monocytes, at 3 ( Figure 2c and e ) and 24 h ( Figure 2d and f ). At 3 h following reperfusion, recruited F4/80low macrophages were Ly6Chigh ( Figure 2c ), which represents immature, newly arrived monocytes from BM. 8 By 24 h, Ly6C expression was markedly downregulated in the F4/80low monocytes ( Figure 2d ); the values for mean fluorescence index were 2243.3 ± 134.2 ( n = 3) and 768.0 ± 47.4 ( n = 3) for 3 and 24 h IRI, respectively ( P < 0.001). This finding suggests that either macrophages mature after migration to the inflamed kidney or mature macrophages infiltrate IRI kidneys. Similarly, the number of F4/80lowGr-1int macrophages in kidneys increased at 3 h ( Figure 2e ) and was greater (relative to sham) by 24 h of reperfusion ( Figure 2f , right). The mean fluorescence index of F4/80lowGr-1int decreased at 24 h compared to 3 h following kidney IRI, paralleling the findings with Ly6C. Therefore, an abundance of infiltrating macro-phages, phenotypically similar to circulating inflamed monocytes, was identified in reperfused kidneys. Heterogeneity of proinflammatory cytokine production by CD11b<sup>high</sup>F4/80<sup>low</sup> and CD11b<sup>high</sup>F4/80<sup>high</sup> 24 h following kidney IRI We used FACS analysis of intracellular cytokine production to determine functional differences between F4/80low and F4/80high populations following kidney IRI. Gating on F4/80low and F4/80high ( Figure 2b ) macrophages from 24 h sham and IRI kidney, we determined expression of intracellular interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, IL-12p40/70, and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-? ( Figure 3a and b ). The proportion of F4/80low macrophages producing cytokines (% of total F4/80low population) following IRI was 4- to 8-fold greater for IRI relative to sham ( Figure 3a and c ). In contrast, the percentage of F4/80high cells ( Figure 3b and d ) that produced IL-1?, IL-6, IL-12p40/70 was unchanged but TNF-?-producing cells increased significantly following IRI compared to sham. Therefore, 24 h following reperfusion, FACS analysis reveals functional differences between F4/80low and F4/80high populations. CCR2-deficient, but not MCP-1-deficient, signaling protects kidneys from IRI Chemokine production attracts monocytes, T cells, and neutrophils to the reperfused kidney. Compared with sham mouse kidneys, expression of RANTES, MIP-2, IP-10, and MCP-1 mRNA increased at 24 h after IRI (data not shown). As CCR2/MCP-1 is an important signaling pathway in mediating monocyte/macrophage migration, we performed kidney IRI in mice deficient in CCR2 (CCR2?/?) or its ligand, MCP-1 (MCP-1?/?). Following 24 h of reperfusion, plasma creatinine levels increased significantly in CCR2+/+ but not in CCR2?/? mice ( Figure 4a ). To determine the contribution of CCR2 expressed on bone marrow (BM)-derived cells to tissue injury following reperfusion, we generated BM chimeras by transferring BM-derived cells from CCR2?/? mice into BM-depleted CCR2+/+ mice (CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+). IRI led to an increase in plasma creatinine in CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ but not in CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 4b ). Tubule cell necrosis in the kidney outer medulla was lower in CCR2?/? mice following IRI compared to CCR2+/+ mice (acute tubular necrosis score: 0.5 ± 0.1 vs 4.5 ± 0.3, P < 0.0001) ( Figure 4c and d ) and in CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ compared with CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+ chimeras (acute tubular necrosis score: 0.6 ± 0.4 vs 4.4 ± 0.3, P < 0.0001) ( Figure 4e and f ). In contrast, the kidneys of MCP-1?/? mice were not protected from IRI; plasma creatinine levels were 2.20 ± 0.13 ( n = 5) and 0.27 ± 0.02 ( n = 4) mg/100 ml for IRI and sham, respectively ( P < 0.001) and more F4/80low macrophages infiltrated injured tissue in MCP-1?/? mice. Although F4/80lowLy6C+ cell counts were similar between sham-operated WT and MCP?/? mice, F4/80low Ly6C+ cell counts ( × 105 cells per g kidney) increased to a similar degree in WT ( n = 3) and KO ( n = 3) mice following IRI (2.42 ± 0.31 and 2.57 ± 0.12, respectively, P = NS). This is probably due to the contribution of other MCP family members to kidney IRI. We evaluated the function of CCR2 expression in mediating F4/80low macrophage recruitment to injured kidneys. Following 24 h of reperfusion, CD11b+F4/80low macrophages increased in kidneys of CCR2+/+ mice and CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 4g ). However, the absence of CCR2 attenuated the increase in F4/80low macrophages in CCR2?/? mice and CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 4g ). Similar results were observed with other markers of F4/80lowLy6C+ macrophages and F4/80lowGr-1int macrophages (not shown). Interestingly, the number of F4/80high kidney resident DCs did not increase in CCR2+/+, CCR2?/?, CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+, or CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ mice following 24 h of reperfusion compared to sham (data not shown). Thus, CCR2 expressed on BM-derived cells mediates F4/80low monocyte/macrophage infiltration into reperfused kidneys. The infiltration of neutrophils in kidneys subjected to IRI in relation to macrophage recruitment was also examined. In CCR2?/? and CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ mice, neutrophils comigrated with macrophages into injured kidneys. Kidney neutrophil cell number ( × 105 per g kidney) following IRI was 2.79 ± 0.23 ( n = 4) and 10.87 ± 1.78 ( n = 4) ( P < 0.005) for CCR2?/? and CCR2+/+, respectively, and 3.46 ± 1.55 ( n = 8) and 13.28 ± 2.31 ( n = 10) ( P < 0.005) for CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ and CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+, respectively. These results suggested that CCR2 also mediated neutrophil recruitment to inflamed kidneys. Deficiency of CX3CR1 reduces kidney IRI CX3CR1 is another chemokine receptor mediating monocyte migration. Following kidney IRI, an increase in plasma creatinine levels was observed in CX3CR1+/GFP mice, but levels were significantly lower in CX3CR1-deficient CX3CR1GFP/GFP mice ( Figure 5a ). Tubule necrosis produced by IRI was also attenuated in CX3CR1GFP/GFP compared with CX3CR1+/GFP mice (acute tubular necrosis score: 2.0 ± 0.74 vs 4.1 ± 0.22, P < 0.05) ( Figure 5b ). Monocyte infiltration of the reperfused kidney is CX3CR1 dependent To test our hypothesis that monocyte recruitment to the reperfused kidney is CX3CR1 dependent, we examined the kidney CX3CR1+ GFPlowGr-1+ and CX3CR1+ GFPlowLy6C+ macrophages in CX3CR1GFP/GFP (CX3CR1 KO) and CX3CR1+/GFP mice 7 following reperfusion ( Figure 5c and d ). We found increased CX3CR1+ GFPlow Gr-1+ macrophage infiltration (cell number, × 105 per g kidney) into reperfused kidneys of CX3CR1+/GFP mice (1.64 ± 0.51 ( n = 7) and 6.86 ± 1.35 ( n = 11) for sham and IRI, respectively ( P < 0.01)) but not in CX3CR1GFP/GFP mice (1.20 ± 0.28 ( n = 6) and 2.21 ± 0.29 ( n = 10) for sham and IRI, respectively ( P > 0.05)). Similar results were found for CX3CR1+ GFPlow Ly6C+ macrophages ( Figure 5d ). The increase from sham following IRI (%) was 316.9 ± 117.5 ( n = 5) and 78.8 ± 39.5 for CX3CR1+/GFP and CX3CR1GFP/GFP ( n = 9), respectively ( P < 0.05). These results indicate that CX3CR1 is important in monocyte/macrophage recruitment following IRI. Infiltrating F4/80<sup>low</sup> macrophages in reperfused kidneys were derived from a blood CD11b<sup>high</sup> Ly6C<sup>high</sup> inflamed monocyte pool Kidney-recruited F4/80low macrophages following IRI ex-pressed Ly6Chigh, Gr-1int and CD62L, markers characteristic of blood-derived inflamed monocytes ( Figure S2 ). The percentage of CD11b+Ly6Chigh monocytes in blood increased as early as 3 h after kidney IRI (4.45 ± 0.85; n = 12) compared with sham (1.72 ± 0.28; n = 12) ( P < 0.01). Because CCR2 is necessary for monocyte trafficking into reperfused kidneys, we examined the function of CCR2 on the blood content of CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes ( Figure 6a ) after kidney IRI. We found increased blood CD11b+ Ly6-Chigh cells in 24 h IRI CCR2+/+ mice compared with sham but not in CCR2?/? mice. We also found that following IRI the percentage (and absolute cell counts; not shown) of blood CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes increased in the CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ but not in the CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 6a ). These results suggest that CCR2 deficiency leads to reduced influx of Ly6Chigh inflamed monocytes into the reperfused kidney due to a reduced blood content of Ly6Chigh inflamed monocytes in CCR2?/? mice and CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras. We next examined whether the reduction of blood CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes in CCR2?/? mice was due to the retention of CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes in BM. After 24 h of kidney reperfusion, CCR2+/+ and CCR2?/? mice had a similar percentage of BM Ly6Chigh monocytes, and the percentage change of BM Ly6Chigh cells in CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ chimeras was similar to CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras following IRI ( Figure 6b ). These findings demonstrated that following kidney IRI, blood CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes are reduced in CCR2?/? mice and could contribute to a diminished blood to kidney tissue gradient. This could contribute to reduced monocyte/macrophage infiltration and tissue protection observed in CCR2?/? mice following IRI. CCR2 and CX3CR1 are necessary for inflamed monocyte migration to the IRI kidney The observed decrease in kidney infiltration of monocytes into reperfused kidneys may be due to: (1) the reduced blood content of monocytes in the CCR2?/? mice (hence reduced gradient from blood to kidney) or (2) the necessity of CCR2 expression on monocytes to facilitate migration from blood to the injured kidney. To distinguish between these two possibilities we transferred the same number (1 × 107) of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled BM monocytes either from CCR2+/+ or CCR2?/? mice to CCR2?/? mice at the onset of kidney IRI and tracked their infiltration into CCR2?/? kidneys subjected to IR ( Figure 6c and d ). CFSE-labeled CCR2+/+ monocytes were detected in reperfused kidneys and comprised primarily the F4/80low population. There was a threefold greater influx of CFSE-labeled CCR2+/+ monocytes in CCR2?/? IRI kidney compared to CFSE-labeled CCR2?/? monocytes. Similarly, we adoptively transferred CX3CR1GFP/GFP or CX3CR1+/GFP BM monocytes into WT mice ( Figure 6e and f ). CX3CR1+/GFP monocytes were detected in reperfused kidneys and com-prised primarily the F4/80low population. There was a 3.2-fold greater influx of CX3CR1+/GFP monocytes into the reperfused kidneys of WTmice compared to CX3CR1GFP/GFP monocytes. The protected kidney function in CCR2?/? mice was reversed following adoptive transfer of CCR2+/+ (1 × 107) but not CCR2?/? monocytes. Creatinine level following IRI was 0.81 ± 0.11 ( n = 4) and 0.51 ± 0.03 ( n = 6) mg/100 ml for CCR2?/? mice that received CCR2+/+ and CCR2?/? monocytes, respectively ( P < 0.05). These data demonstrated that monocytes expressing CCR2 represent inflamed monocytes that migrate to the IRI kidney and contribute to tissue injury in a CCR2-dependent manner. The data from these two experiments provide strong evidence that the protection observed following reperfusion in CCR2- and CX3CR1-deficient mice is due to a reduced CCR2- and CX3CR1-dependant infiltration of F4/80low macrophages and that the reduced infiltration into reperfused kidneys is due to the combined effect of reduced emigration of monocytes from BM (CCR2?/? mice) and reduced migration of monocytes into injured kidneys.  F4/80<sup>+</sup> leukocytes are abundantly expressed in normal mouse kidneys and their numbers increase rapidly following kidney IR Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry revealed that F4/80-positive (F4/80+) cells were the most abundant resting leukocyte population, constituting ~50% of the CD45+ population in normal kidneys ( Figure S1a and b ). We next examined the effect of kidney IR on the time course of F4/80+ infiltration relative to other leukocytes ( Figure S1c ). Although at baseline the F4/80+ cell population was the most abundant leukocyte subset, at 30 min of reperfusion there was no increase in infiltration of F4/80+ cells above sham. At 1 h of reperfusion, the number of F4/80+ cells (macrophages) increased significantly, peaking at 24 h, and persisting for at least 7 days following reperfusion.  F4/80<sup>+</sup> leukocytes are abundantly expressed in normal mouse kidneys and their numbers increase rapidly following kidney IR Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry revealed that F4/80-positive (F4/80+) cells were the most abundant resting leukocyte population, constituting ~50% of the CD45+ population in normal kidneys ( Figure S1a and b ). We next examined the effect of kidney IR on the time course of F4/80+ infiltration relative to other leukocytes ( Figure S1c ). Although at baseline the F4/80+ cell population was the most abundant leukocyte subset, at 30 min of reperfusion there was no increase in infiltration of F4/80+ cells above sham. At 1 h of reperfusion, the number of F4/80+ cells (macrophages) increased significantly, peaking at 24 h, and persisting for at least 7 days following reperfusion.  There are two macrophage subtypes in the kidney with distinct phenotypes Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis identified two subsets of F4/80+ cells in normal mouse kidneys, CD11blowF4/80high (referred to as F4/80high) and CD11bhighF4/80low (F4/80low) cells, based on the F4/80 and CD11b fluorescence intensity ( Figure 1a ). The F4/80high cells comprised ~40% of the total leukocyte (CD45+) population and represented the major leukocyte population within normal mouse kidneys. Using monocyte, DC, chemokine receptor, adhesion and toll-like receptor (TLR) markers these two F4/80+ subsets had distinct phenotypes ( Figure 1b–d ; Table 1 ). All F4/80low cells expressed CD62L+, Ly6Chigh, Gr-1int ( Figure 2b ), and CX3CR1low ( Figure 2c ), a phenotype characteristic of the blood inflamed monocyte. 7 , 8 All F4/80high cells expressed CD11c+, MHC class IIhigh (IAhigh), CD86+, and CX3CR1high ( Figure 1c ), a phenotype characteristic of DCs. Both subsets expressed lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1, very late antigen-4, TLR2, MD-1 ( Figure 1d ), and RP-105 (not shown). Therefore, F4/80high cells and F4/80low cells were considered to represent kidney resident DCs and macrophages derived from the inflamed monocyte pool, respectively. As both kidney F4/80+ subsets express CX3CR1, we used CX3CR1+/GFP mice to track macrophages and DCs in normal kidney. Targeted deletion of CX3CR1 and replacement with the gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) provides a useful means for following labeled cells and for studying the function of CX3CR1. GFP is expressed in all CX3CR1+/GFP and homozygous CX3CR1GFP/GFP circulating CD11b+F4/80+ cells. 7 , 19 , 20 Most of the kidney CX3CR1 GFP+ DCs are resident DCs and are distributed throughout the cortex ( Figure 1e ) and outer medulla ( Figure 1f ), consistent with a recent report. 21 MHC II (IA) distribution was mainly in the kidney medulla ( Figure 1f ), compared to cortex ( Figure 1e ), and most GFP+ cells expressed IA ( Figure 1e–g ) and F4/80 on the cell surface ( Figure 1h ). DCs comprised 85% of the GFP+ cells ( Figure 1i ). All of the CX3CR1+GFPhigh cells expressed CD11b, and most expressed CD11c and MHC II, markers for DCs ( Figure 1i ). Ly6C and Gr-1 were expressed primarily on the GFPlow population ( Figure 1j ), which has the same phenotype as the blood inflamed monocytes. 7 Both GFP+ cell populations expressed F4/80 ( Figure 1h and j ). Kidney F4/80low leukocytes had a similar phenotype to GFPlow cells in CX3CR1+/GFP mice and represented kidney monocyte/macrophages, whereas the F4/80high subset resemble CX3CR1+ GFPhigh cells and represented resident kidney DCs ( Figure 1b and c ).  There are two macrophage subtypes in the kidney with distinct phenotypes Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis identified two subsets of F4/80+ cells in normal mouse kidneys, CD11blowF4/80high (referred to as F4/80high) and CD11bhighF4/80low (F4/80low) cells, based on the F4/80 and CD11b fluorescence intensity ( Figure 1a ). The F4/80high cells comprised ~40% of the total leukocyte (CD45+) population and represented the major leukocyte population within normal mouse kidneys. Using monocyte, DC, chemokine receptor, adhesion and toll-like receptor (TLR) markers these two F4/80+ subsets had distinct phenotypes ( Figure 1b–d ; Table 1 ). All F4/80low cells expressed CD62L+, Ly6Chigh, Gr-1int ( Figure 2b ), and CX3CR1low ( Figure 2c ), a phenotype characteristic of the blood inflamed monocyte. 7 , 8 All F4/80high cells expressed CD11c+, MHC class IIhigh (IAhigh), CD86+, and CX3CR1high ( Figure 1c ), a phenotype characteristic of DCs. Both subsets expressed lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1, very late antigen-4, TLR2, MD-1 ( Figure 1d ), and RP-105 (not shown). Therefore, F4/80high cells and F4/80low cells were considered to represent kidney resident DCs and macrophages derived from the inflamed monocyte pool, respectively. As both kidney F4/80+ subsets express CX3CR1, we used CX3CR1+/GFP mice to track macrophages and DCs in normal kidney. Targeted deletion of CX3CR1 and replacement with the gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) provides a useful means for following labeled cells and for studying the function of CX3CR1. GFP is expressed in all CX3CR1+/GFP and homozygous CX3CR1GFP/GFP circulating CD11b+F4/80+ cells. 7 , 19 , 20 Most of the kidney CX3CR1 GFP+ DCs are resident DCs and are distributed throughout the cortex ( Figure 1e ) and outer medulla ( Figure 1f ), consistent with a recent report. 21 MHC II (IA) distribution was mainly in the kidney medulla ( Figure 1f ), compared to cortex ( Figure 1e ), and most GFP+ cells expressed IA ( Figure 1e–g ) and F4/80 on the cell surface ( Figure 1h ). DCs comprised 85% of the GFP+ cells ( Figure 1i ). All of the CX3CR1+GFPhigh cells expressed CD11b, and most expressed CD11c and MHC II, markers for DCs ( Figure 1i ). Ly6C and Gr-1 were expressed primarily on the GFPlow population ( Figure 1j ), which has the same phenotype as the blood inflamed monocytes. 7 Both GFP+ cell populations expressed F4/80 ( Figure 1h and j ). Kidney F4/80low leukocytes had a similar phenotype to GFPlow cells in CX3CR1+/GFP mice and represented kidney monocyte/macrophages, whereas the F4/80high subset resemble CX3CR1+ GFPhigh cells and represented resident kidney DCs ( Figure 1b and c ).  Recruitment of F4/80<sup>low</sup> macrophage subset following kidney IRI Following 3 ( Figure 2a and g ) and 24 h ( Figure 2b and h ) of reperfusion FACS analysis showed an increase in the cell number of F4/80low macrophages. However, 3 ( Figure 2a and g ) and 24 h ( Figure 2b and h ) after reperfusion there was no change in the number of F4/80high kidney resident DCs. Similar results were observed with Ly6Chigh and Gr-1int markers expressed on the blood inflamed monocytes, at 3 ( Figure 2c and e ) and 24 h ( Figure 2d and f ). At 3 h following reperfusion, recruited F4/80low macrophages were Ly6Chigh ( Figure 2c ), which represents immature, newly arrived monocytes from BM. 8 By 24 h, Ly6C expression was markedly downregulated in the F4/80low monocytes ( Figure 2d ); the values for mean fluorescence index were 2243.3 ± 134.2 ( n = 3) and 768.0 ± 47.4 ( n = 3) for 3 and 24 h IRI, respectively ( P < 0.001). This finding suggests that either macrophages mature after migration to the inflamed kidney or mature macrophages infiltrate IRI kidneys. Similarly, the number of F4/80lowGr-1int macrophages in kidneys increased at 3 h ( Figure 2e ) and was greater (relative to sham) by 24 h of reperfusion ( Figure 2f , right). The mean fluorescence index of F4/80lowGr-1int decreased at 24 h compared to 3 h following kidney IRI, paralleling the findings with Ly6C. Therefore, an abundance of infiltrating macro-phages, phenotypically similar to circulating inflamed monocytes, was identified in reperfused kidneys.  Recruitment of F4/80<sup>low</sup> macrophage subset following kidney IRI Following 3 ( Figure 2a and g ) and 24 h ( Figure 2b and h ) of reperfusion FACS analysis showed an increase in the cell number of F4/80low macrophages. However, 3 ( Figure 2a and g ) and 24 h ( Figure 2b and h ) after reperfusion there was no change in the number of F4/80high kidney resident DCs. Similar results were observed with Ly6Chigh and Gr-1int markers expressed on the blood inflamed monocytes, at 3 ( Figure 2c and e ) and 24 h ( Figure 2d and f ). At 3 h following reperfusion, recruited F4/80low macrophages were Ly6Chigh ( Figure 2c ), which represents immature, newly arrived monocytes from BM. 8 By 24 h, Ly6C expression was markedly downregulated in the F4/80low monocytes ( Figure 2d ); the values for mean fluorescence index were 2243.3 ± 134.2 ( n = 3) and 768.0 ± 47.4 ( n = 3) for 3 and 24 h IRI, respectively ( P < 0.001). This finding suggests that either macrophages mature after migration to the inflamed kidney or mature macrophages infiltrate IRI kidneys. Similarly, the number of F4/80lowGr-1int macrophages in kidneys increased at 3 h ( Figure 2e ) and was greater (relative to sham) by 24 h of reperfusion ( Figure 2f , right). The mean fluorescence index of F4/80lowGr-1int decreased at 24 h compared to 3 h following kidney IRI, paralleling the findings with Ly6C. Therefore, an abundance of infiltrating macro-phages, phenotypically similar to circulating inflamed monocytes, was identified in reperfused kidneys.  Heterogeneity of proinflammatory cytokine production by CD11b<sup>high</sup>F4/80<sup>low</sup> and CD11b<sup>high</sup>F4/80<sup>high</sup> 24 h following kidney IRI We used FACS analysis of intracellular cytokine production to determine functional differences between F4/80low and F4/80high populations following kidney IRI. Gating on F4/80low and F4/80high ( Figure 2b ) macrophages from 24 h sham and IRI kidney, we determined expression of intracellular interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, IL-12p40/70, and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-? ( Figure 3a and b ). The proportion of F4/80low macrophages producing cytokines (% of total F4/80low population) following IRI was 4- to 8-fold greater for IRI relative to sham ( Figure 3a and c ). In contrast, the percentage of F4/80high cells ( Figure 3b and d ) that produced IL-1?, IL-6, IL-12p40/70 was unchanged but TNF-?-producing cells increased significantly following IRI compared to sham. Therefore, 24 h following reperfusion, FACS analysis reveals functional differences between F4/80low and F4/80high populations.  Heterogeneity of proinflammatory cytokine production by CD11b<sup>high</sup>F4/80<sup>low</sup> and CD11b<sup>high</sup>F4/80<sup>high</sup> 24 h following kidney IRI We used FACS analysis of intracellular cytokine production to determine functional differences between F4/80low and F4/80high populations following kidney IRI. Gating on F4/80low and F4/80high ( Figure 2b ) macrophages from 24 h sham and IRI kidney, we determined expression of intracellular interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, IL-12p40/70, and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-? ( Figure 3a and b ). The proportion of F4/80low macrophages producing cytokines (% of total F4/80low population) following IRI was 4- to 8-fold greater for IRI relative to sham ( Figure 3a and c ). In contrast, the percentage of F4/80high cells ( Figure 3b and d ) that produced IL-1?, IL-6, IL-12p40/70 was unchanged but TNF-?-producing cells increased significantly following IRI compared to sham. Therefore, 24 h following reperfusion, FACS analysis reveals functional differences between F4/80low and F4/80high populations.  CCR2-deficient, but not MCP-1-deficient, signaling protects kidneys from IRI Chemokine production attracts monocytes, T cells, and neutrophils to the reperfused kidney. Compared with sham mouse kidneys, expression of RANTES, MIP-2, IP-10, and MCP-1 mRNA increased at 24 h after IRI (data not shown). As CCR2/MCP-1 is an important signaling pathway in mediating monocyte/macrophage migration, we performed kidney IRI in mice deficient in CCR2 (CCR2?/?) or its ligand, MCP-1 (MCP-1?/?). Following 24 h of reperfusion, plasma creatinine levels increased significantly in CCR2+/+ but not in CCR2?/? mice ( Figure 4a ). To determine the contribution of CCR2 expressed on bone marrow (BM)-derived cells to tissue injury following reperfusion, we generated BM chimeras by transferring BM-derived cells from CCR2?/? mice into BM-depleted CCR2+/+ mice (CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+). IRI led to an increase in plasma creatinine in CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ but not in CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 4b ). Tubule cell necrosis in the kidney outer medulla was lower in CCR2?/? mice following IRI compared to CCR2+/+ mice (acute tubular necrosis score: 0.5 ± 0.1 vs 4.5 ± 0.3, P < 0.0001) ( Figure 4c and d ) and in CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ compared with CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+ chimeras (acute tubular necrosis score: 0.6 ± 0.4 vs 4.4 ± 0.3, P < 0.0001) ( Figure 4e and f ). In contrast, the kidneys of MCP-1?/? mice were not protected from IRI; plasma creatinine levels were 2.20 ± 0.13 ( n = 5) and 0.27 ± 0.02 ( n = 4) mg/100 ml for IRI and sham, respectively ( P < 0.001) and more F4/80low macrophages infiltrated injured tissue in MCP-1?/? mice. Although F4/80lowLy6C+ cell counts were similar between sham-operated WT and MCP?/? mice, F4/80low Ly6C+ cell counts ( × 105 cells per g kidney) increased to a similar degree in WT ( n = 3) and KO ( n = 3) mice following IRI (2.42 ± 0.31 and 2.57 ± 0.12, respectively, P = NS). This is probably due to the contribution of other MCP family members to kidney IRI. We evaluated the function of CCR2 expression in mediating F4/80low macrophage recruitment to injured kidneys. Following 24 h of reperfusion, CD11b+F4/80low macrophages increased in kidneys of CCR2+/+ mice and CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 4g ). However, the absence of CCR2 attenuated the increase in F4/80low macrophages in CCR2?/? mice and CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 4g ). Similar results were observed with other markers of F4/80lowLy6C+ macrophages and F4/80lowGr-1int macrophages (not shown). Interestingly, the number of F4/80high kidney resident DCs did not increase in CCR2+/+, CCR2?/?, CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+, or CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ mice following 24 h of reperfusion compared to sham (data not shown). Thus, CCR2 expressed on BM-derived cells mediates F4/80low monocyte/macrophage infiltration into reperfused kidneys. The infiltration of neutrophils in kidneys subjected to IRI in relation to macrophage recruitment was also examined. In CCR2?/? and CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ mice, neutrophils comigrated with macrophages into injured kidneys. Kidney neutrophil cell number ( × 105 per g kidney) following IRI was 2.79 ± 0.23 ( n = 4) and 10.87 ± 1.78 ( n = 4) ( P < 0.005) for CCR2?/? and CCR2+/+, respectively, and 3.46 ± 1.55 ( n = 8) and 13.28 ± 2.31 ( n = 10) ( P < 0.005) for CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ and CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+, respectively. These results suggested that CCR2 also mediated neutrophil recruitment to inflamed kidneys.  CCR2-deficient, but not MCP-1-deficient, signaling protects kidneys from IRI Chemokine production attracts monocytes, T cells, and neutrophils to the reperfused kidney. Compared with sham mouse kidneys, expression of RANTES, MIP-2, IP-10, and MCP-1 mRNA increased at 24 h after IRI (data not shown). As CCR2/MCP-1 is an important signaling pathway in mediating monocyte/macrophage migration, we performed kidney IRI in mice deficient in CCR2 (CCR2?/?) or its ligand, MCP-1 (MCP-1?/?). Following 24 h of reperfusion, plasma creatinine levels increased significantly in CCR2+/+ but not in CCR2?/? mice ( Figure 4a ). To determine the contribution of CCR2 expressed on bone marrow (BM)-derived cells to tissue injury following reperfusion, we generated BM chimeras by transferring BM-derived cells from CCR2?/? mice into BM-depleted CCR2+/+ mice (CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+). IRI led to an increase in plasma creatinine in CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ but not in CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 4b ). Tubule cell necrosis in the kidney outer medulla was lower in CCR2?/? mice following IRI compared to CCR2+/+ mice (acute tubular necrosis score: 0.5 ± 0.1 vs 4.5 ± 0.3, P < 0.0001) ( Figure 4c and d ) and in CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ compared with CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+ chimeras (acute tubular necrosis score: 0.6 ± 0.4 vs 4.4 ± 0.3, P < 0.0001) ( Figure 4e and f ). In contrast, the kidneys of MCP-1?/? mice were not protected from IRI; plasma creatinine levels were 2.20 ± 0.13 ( n = 5) and 0.27 ± 0.02 ( n = 4) mg/100 ml for IRI and sham, respectively ( P < 0.001) and more F4/80low macrophages infiltrated injured tissue in MCP-1?/? mice. Although F4/80lowLy6C+ cell counts were similar between sham-operated WT and MCP?/? mice, F4/80low Ly6C+ cell counts ( × 105 cells per g kidney) increased to a similar degree in WT ( n = 3) and KO ( n = 3) mice following IRI (2.42 ± 0.31 and 2.57 ± 0.12, respectively, P = NS). This is probably due to the contribution of other MCP family members to kidney IRI. We evaluated the function of CCR2 expression in mediating F4/80low macrophage recruitment to injured kidneys. Following 24 h of reperfusion, CD11b+F4/80low macrophages increased in kidneys of CCR2+/+ mice and CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 4g ). However, the absence of CCR2 attenuated the increase in F4/80low macrophages in CCR2?/? mice and CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 4g ). Similar results were observed with other markers of F4/80lowLy6C+ macrophages and F4/80lowGr-1int macrophages (not shown). Interestingly, the number of F4/80high kidney resident DCs did not increase in CCR2+/+, CCR2?/?, CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+, or CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ mice following 24 h of reperfusion compared to sham (data not shown). Thus, CCR2 expressed on BM-derived cells mediates F4/80low monocyte/macrophage infiltration into reperfused kidneys. The infiltration of neutrophils in kidneys subjected to IRI in relation to macrophage recruitment was also examined. In CCR2?/? and CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ mice, neutrophils comigrated with macrophages into injured kidneys. Kidney neutrophil cell number ( × 105 per g kidney) following IRI was 2.79 ± 0.23 ( n = 4) and 10.87 ± 1.78 ( n = 4) ( P < 0.005) for CCR2?/? and CCR2+/+, respectively, and 3.46 ± 1.55 ( n = 8) and 13.28 ± 2.31 ( n = 10) ( P < 0.005) for CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ and CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+, respectively. These results suggested that CCR2 also mediated neutrophil recruitment to inflamed kidneys.  Deficiency of CX3CR1 reduces kidney IRI CX3CR1 is another chemokine receptor mediating monocyte migration. Following kidney IRI, an increase in plasma creatinine levels was observed in CX3CR1+/GFP mice, but levels were significantly lower in CX3CR1-deficient CX3CR1GFP/GFP mice ( Figure 5a ). Tubule necrosis produced by IRI was also attenuated in CX3CR1GFP/GFP compared with CX3CR1+/GFP mice (acute tubular necrosis score: 2.0 ± 0.74 vs 4.1 ± 0.22, P < 0.05) ( Figure 5b ).  Deficiency of CX3CR1 reduces kidney IRI CX3CR1 is another chemokine receptor mediating monocyte migration. Following kidney IRI, an increase in plasma creatinine levels was observed in CX3CR1+/GFP mice, but levels were significantly lower in CX3CR1-deficient CX3CR1GFP/GFP mice ( Figure 5a ). Tubule necrosis produced by IRI was also attenuated in CX3CR1GFP/GFP compared with CX3CR1+/GFP mice (acute tubular necrosis score: 2.0 ± 0.74 vs 4.1 ± 0.22, P < 0.05) ( Figure 5b ).  Monocyte infiltration of the reperfused kidney is CX3CR1 dependent To test our hypothesis that monocyte recruitment to the reperfused kidney is CX3CR1 dependent, we examined the kidney CX3CR1+ GFPlowGr-1+ and CX3CR1+ GFPlowLy6C+ macrophages in CX3CR1GFP/GFP (CX3CR1 KO) and CX3CR1+/GFP mice 7 following reperfusion ( Figure 5c and d ). We found increased CX3CR1+ GFPlow Gr-1+ macrophage infiltration (cell number, × 105 per g kidney) into reperfused kidneys of CX3CR1+/GFP mice (1.64 ± 0.51 ( n = 7) and 6.86 ± 1.35 ( n = 11) for sham and IRI, respectively ( P < 0.01)) but not in CX3CR1GFP/GFP mice (1.20 ± 0.28 ( n = 6) and 2.21 ± 0.29 ( n = 10) for sham and IRI, respectively ( P > 0.05)). Similar results were found for CX3CR1+ GFPlow Ly6C+ macrophages ( Figure 5d ). The increase from sham following IRI (%) was 316.9 ± 117.5 ( n = 5) and 78.8 ± 39.5 for CX3CR1+/GFP and CX3CR1GFP/GFP ( n = 9), respectively ( P < 0.05). These results indicate that CX3CR1 is important in monocyte/macrophage recruitment following IRI.  Monocyte infiltration of the reperfused kidney is CX3CR1 dependent To test our hypothesis that monocyte recruitment to the reperfused kidney is CX3CR1 dependent, we examined the kidney CX3CR1+ GFPlowGr-1+ and CX3CR1+ GFPlowLy6C+ macrophages in CX3CR1GFP/GFP (CX3CR1 KO) and CX3CR1+/GFP mice 7 following reperfusion ( Figure 5c and d ). We found increased CX3CR1+ GFPlow Gr-1+ macrophage infiltration (cell number, × 105 per g kidney) into reperfused kidneys of CX3CR1+/GFP mice (1.64 ± 0.51 ( n = 7) and 6.86 ± 1.35 ( n = 11) for sham and IRI, respectively ( P < 0.01)) but not in CX3CR1GFP/GFP mice (1.20 ± 0.28 ( n = 6) and 2.21 ± 0.29 ( n = 10) for sham and IRI, respectively ( P > 0.05)). Similar results were found for CX3CR1+ GFPlow Ly6C+ macrophages ( Figure 5d ). The increase from sham following IRI (%) was 316.9 ± 117.5 ( n = 5) and 78.8 ± 39.5 for CX3CR1+/GFP and CX3CR1GFP/GFP ( n = 9), respectively ( P < 0.05). These results indicate that CX3CR1 is important in monocyte/macrophage recruitment following IRI.  Infiltrating F4/80<sup>low</sup> macrophages in reperfused kidneys were derived from a blood CD11b<sup>high</sup> Ly6C<sup>high</sup> inflamed monocyte pool Kidney-recruited F4/80low macrophages following IRI ex-pressed Ly6Chigh, Gr-1int and CD62L, markers characteristic of blood-derived inflamed monocytes ( Figure S2 ). The percentage of CD11b+Ly6Chigh monocytes in blood increased as early as 3 h after kidney IRI (4.45 ± 0.85; n = 12) compared with sham (1.72 ± 0.28; n = 12) ( P < 0.01). Because CCR2 is necessary for monocyte trafficking into reperfused kidneys, we examined the function of CCR2 on the blood content of CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes ( Figure 6a ) after kidney IRI. We found increased blood CD11b+ Ly6-Chigh cells in 24 h IRI CCR2+/+ mice compared with sham but not in CCR2?/? mice. We also found that following IRI the percentage (and absolute cell counts; not shown) of blood CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes increased in the CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ but not in the CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 6a ). These results suggest that CCR2 deficiency leads to reduced influx of Ly6Chigh inflamed monocytes into the reperfused kidney due to a reduced blood content of Ly6Chigh inflamed monocytes in CCR2?/? mice and CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras. We next examined whether the reduction of blood CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes in CCR2?/? mice was due to the retention of CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes in BM. After 24 h of kidney reperfusion, CCR2+/+ and CCR2?/? mice had a similar percentage of BM Ly6Chigh monocytes, and the percentage change of BM Ly6Chigh cells in CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ chimeras was similar to CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras following IRI ( Figure 6b ). These findings demonstrated that following kidney IRI, blood CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes are reduced in CCR2?/? mice and could contribute to a diminished blood to kidney tissue gradient. This could contribute to reduced monocyte/macrophage infiltration and tissue protection observed in CCR2?/? mice following IRI.  Infiltrating F4/80<sup>low</sup> macrophages in reperfused kidneys were derived from a blood CD11b<sup>high</sup> Ly6C<sup>high</sup> inflamed monocyte pool Kidney-recruited F4/80low macrophages following IRI ex-pressed Ly6Chigh, Gr-1int and CD62L, markers characteristic of blood-derived inflamed monocytes ( Figure S2 ). The percentage of CD11b+Ly6Chigh monocytes in blood increased as early as 3 h after kidney IRI (4.45 ± 0.85; n = 12) compared with sham (1.72 ± 0.28; n = 12) ( P < 0.01). Because CCR2 is necessary for monocyte trafficking into reperfused kidneys, we examined the function of CCR2 on the blood content of CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes ( Figure 6a ) after kidney IRI. We found increased blood CD11b+ Ly6-Chigh cells in 24 h IRI CCR2+/+ mice compared with sham but not in CCR2?/? mice. We also found that following IRI the percentage (and absolute cell counts; not shown) of blood CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes increased in the CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ but not in the CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras ( Figure 6a ). These results suggest that CCR2 deficiency leads to reduced influx of Ly6Chigh inflamed monocytes into the reperfused kidney due to a reduced blood content of Ly6Chigh inflamed monocytes in CCR2?/? mice and CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras. We next examined whether the reduction of blood CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes in CCR2?/? mice was due to the retention of CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes in BM. After 24 h of kidney reperfusion, CCR2+/+ and CCR2?/? mice had a similar percentage of BM Ly6Chigh monocytes, and the percentage change of BM Ly6Chigh cells in CCR2+/+ ? CCR2+/+ chimeras was similar to CCR2?/? ? CCR2+/+ chimeras following IRI ( Figure 6b ). These findings demonstrated that following kidney IRI, blood CD11b+ Ly6Chigh monocytes are reduced in CCR2?/? mice and could contribute to a diminished blood to kidney tissue gradient. This could contribute to reduced monocyte/macrophage infiltration and tissue protection observed in CCR2?/? mice following IRI.  CCR2 and CX3CR1 are necessary for inflamed monocyte migration to the IRI kidney The observed decrease in kidney infiltration of monocytes into reperfused kidneys may be due to: (1) the reduced blood content of monocytes in the CCR2?/? mice (hence reduced gradient from blood to kidney) or (2) the necessity of CCR2 expression on monocytes to facilitate migration from blood to the injured kidney. To distinguish between these two possibilities we transferred the same number (1 × 107) of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled BM monocytes either from CCR2+/+ or CCR2?/? mice to CCR2?/? mice at the onset of kidney IRI and tracked their infiltration into CCR2?/? kidneys subjected to IR ( Figure 6c and d ). CFSE-labeled CCR2+/+ monocytes were detected in reperfused kidneys and comprised primarily the F4/80low population. There was a threefold greater influx of CFSE-labeled CCR2+/+ monocytes in CCR2?/? IRI kidney compared to CFSE-labeled CCR2?/? monocytes. Similarly, we adoptively transferred CX3CR1GFP/GFP or CX3CR1+/GFP BM monocytes into WT mice ( Figure 6e and f ). CX3CR1+/GFP monocytes were detected in reperfused kidneys and com-prised primarily the F4/80low population. There was a 3.2-fold greater influx of CX3CR1+/GFP monocytes into the reperfused kidneys of WTmice compared to CX3CR1GFP/GFP monocytes. The protected kidney function in CCR2?/? mice was reversed following adoptive transfer of CCR2+/+ (1 × 107) but not CCR2?/? monocytes. Creatinine level following IRI was 0.81 ± 0.11 ( n = 4) and 0.51 ± 0.03 ( n = 6) mg/100 ml for CCR2?/? mice that received CCR2+/+ and CCR2?/? monocytes, respectively ( P < 0.05). These data demonstrated that monocytes expressing CCR2 represent inflamed monocytes that migrate to the IRI kidney and contribute to tissue injury in a CCR2-dependent manner. The data from these two experiments provide strong evidence that the protection observed following reperfusion in CCR2- and CX3CR1-deficient mice is due to a reduced CCR2- and CX3CR1-dependant infiltration of F4/80low macrophages and that the reduced infiltration into reperfused kidneys is due to the combined effect of reduced emigration of monocytes from BM (CCR2?/? mice) and reduced migration of monocytes into injured kidneys.  CCR2 and CX3CR1 are necessary for inflamed monocyte migration to the IRI kidney The observed decrease in kidney infiltration of monocytes into reperfused kidneys may be due to: (1) the reduced blood content of monocytes in the CCR2?/? mice (hence reduced gradient from blood to kidney) or (2) the necessity of CCR2 expression on monocytes to facilitate migration from blood to the injured kidney. To distinguish between these two possibilities we transferred the same number (1 × 107) of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled BM monocytes either from CCR2+/+ or CCR2?/? mice to CCR2?/? mice at the onset of kidney IRI and tracked their infiltration into CCR2?/? kidneys subjected to IR ( Figure 6c and d ). CFSE-labeled CCR2+/+ monocytes were detected in reperfused kidneys and comprised primarily the F4/80low population. There was a threefold greater influx of CFSE-labeled CCR2+/+ monocytes in CCR2?/? IRI kidney compared to CFSE-labeled CCR2?/? monocytes. Similarly, we adoptively transferred CX3CR1GFP/GFP or CX3CR1+/GFP BM monocytes into WT mice ( Figure 6e and f ). CX3CR1+/GFP monocytes were detected in reperfused kidneys and com-prised primarily the F4/80low population. There was a 3.2-fold greater influx of CX3CR1+/GFP monocytes into the reperfused kidneys of WTmice compared to CX3CR1GFP/GFP monocytes. The protected kidney function in CCR2?/? mice was reversed following adoptive transfer of CCR2+/+ (1 × 107) but not CCR2?/? monocytes. Creatinine level following IRI was 0.81 ± 0.11 ( n = 4) and 0.51 ± 0.03 ( n = 6) mg/100 ml for CCR2?/? mice that received CCR2+/+ and CCR2?/? monocytes, respectively ( P < 0.05). These data demonstrated that monocytes expressing CCR2 represent inflamed monocytes that migrate to the IRI kidney and contribute to tissue injury in a CCR2-dependent manner. The data from these two experiments provide strong evidence that the protection observed following reperfusion in CCR2- and CX3CR1-deficient mice is due to a reduced CCR2- and CX3CR1-dependant infiltration of F4/80low macrophages and that the reduced infiltration into reperfused kidneys is due to the combined effect of reduced emigration of monocytes from BM (CCR2?/? mice) and reduced migration of monocytes into injured kidneys.  DISCUSSION Early infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils contributes to the innate immune response of kidney IRI. 4 – 6 Macrophages are a heterogeneous population, and two subsets of monocyte/macrophages have been identified: Ly6-Chigh CCR2+ Gr-1+ CX3CR1low and Ly6ClowCCR2?Gr-1? CX3CR1high. 11 , 12 In this study, we made two seminal observations. First, we showed that F4/80+ cells in normal kidneys consist of two subsets: (1) F4/80low macrophages derived from the blood inflamed monocyte pool and (2) F4/80high population phenotypically representing DCs. This conclusion is supported by the following: (1) the use of multiple cell-surface markers ( Table 1 ; Figure 1 ) that can distinguish between two different types of macrophages; 7 (2) the two macrophage subsets exhibit functional differences; F4/80high cells do not produce cytokines to a large degree with the exception of TNF-?, whereas F4/80low cells produce an abundance of proinflammatory cytokines after IRI; and (3) the F4/80high population possesses characteristics of a professional antigen presenting cell (L. Li and M.D. Okusa, unpublished observation, 2008). Second, increased CD11b+ F4/80lowLy6ChighCCR2+ Gr-1+ CX3CR1low cells infiltrate IRI kidneys, and CCR2 and CX3CR1 mediate trafficking of inflamed monocytes from blood to kidneys. The number of blood Ly6Chigh monocytes increased dramatically after IRI suggesting that this population of circulating inflamed monocytes may be the source of macrophages infiltrating injured kidneys. We provide a comprehensive analysis of trafficking of the inflamed monocyte subset from blood to kidney, which leads to early initiation of the innate response following kidney IRI. CCR2-dependent monocyte/macrophage trafficking following kidney IRI In atherosclerosis, CCR2, CCR5, and CX3CR1 mediate monocyte/macrophage migration into inflamed tissue 12 and CCR2?/? mice were protected from Listeria monocytogenes infection due to an attenuation of monocyte egress from BM. 22 Further, CCR2?/? mice were protected from kidney IRI, and this protection was associated with reduced macrophage infiltration. 23 Our studies compliment these results and demonstrate a causal relation between CCR2-expressing monocyte/macrophages and tissue injury following kidney IRI. In the current studies, CCR2?/? mouse kidney protection was due to a reduction of blood monocytes. Although reduced infiltration of monocytes into the reperfused kidney may be due secondarily to reduction in blood levels of monocytes and not to a primary defect in CCR2?/? monocyte response to chemokines, we do not believe that this is the case. Preventing the decrease in blood monocytes in CCR2?/? mice by transferring CCR2?/? monocytes did not facilitate their entry in injured tissues. However, transfer of CCR2+/+ monocytes did facilitate macrophage infiltration and induce injury. In contrast in L. monocytogenes -infected mice, TNF-?-producing CCR2?/? monocytes infiltrated inflamed spleen, 22 a finding that differs from our study but that could be explained by differences in the model (septic vs aseptic IRI) and tissue (spleen vs kidney) examined in the two studies. Therefore, inflamed monocyte migration into the reperfused kidney is in part CCR2 dependent and contributes to early inflammation in kidney IRI. Previous studies examining the proinflammatory cytokines in IRI kidney have used PCR or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of whole kidney homogenate and suggested infiltrated macrophages identified by immunohistochemistry as a likely source of cytokine production. Indeed, an increase in cytokine level in whole kidney may represent production by immune, epithelial, interstitial, or endothelial cells, and as such the cellular source of cytokines has remained unknown. Our study is the first one to determine at a single immune cell (macrophage) proinflammatory cytokine production by using FACS intracellular staining. CX3CL1/CX3CR1-mediated monocyte/macrophage trafficking in kidney IRI CX3CL1/CX3CR1 is another pathway mediating monocyte migration. CX3CR1low Gr-1+ CCR2+ subsets are actively recruited to inflamed tissue and CX3CR1highGr-1? CCR2? subsets migrate to uninjured tissue and differentiate into resident macrophages and DCs. 9 CX3CR1-deficient (CX3CR1GFP/GFP) mice are significantly protected from rejection of transplanted hearts. 24 We found that CX3CR1?/? mouse kidneys were protected from IRI, confirming studies that employed a CX3CR1 blocking antibody, 25 and this protection was associated with less GFPlowGr-1+ or GFPlowLy6C+ macrophage infiltration compared to the heterogeneous CX3CR1+/GFP mice. Thus CX3CR1 signaling mediates infiltration of inflamed monocytes into injured kidneys. CCR2 and CX3CR1 may act cooperatively and/or independently as each may be responsible for specific mechanisms of monocyte trafficking in inflamed tissue. Tacke et al. 12 found that CCR2?Ly6Clow monocytes infiltrated atherosclerosis plaques less frequently compared with CCR2+ Ly6Chigh monocytes, and CCR2? Ly6Clow monocyte recruitment is CCR5 dependent and CCR2 independent, but CCR2+ Ly6Chigh monocyte migration is CX3CR1 dependent. DCs participate in innate and adaptive immunity, autoimmunity, allograft, and host defense. 26 F4/80high resident DCs are the predominant leukocyte subset, but the function of kidney DCs in IRI is unknown completely. TNF-? production from kidney DCs at early time points following IR was involved in kidney injury. 27 We showed recently that kidney F4/80high DCs mediate OT-II T-cell proliferation by presenting OVA323-339 efficiently (L. Li and M.D. Okusa, unpublished observation, 2008) and present self-glycolipid to activate natural killer T cells (NKT) by producing interferon-? following reperfusion. 28 IL-12 and IL-23 are important cytokines secreted by activated DCs. IL-23 mediates neu-trophil recruitment and production of related chemokines CXCL1, 2, and 5 29 and may also be involved in kidney IRI. Lastly, it should be recognized that other macrophage subsets likely participate in repair of kidney following IRI. 4 The alternative macrophage expressing the mannose receptor and activated by IL-4 and IL-13 likely participates in tissue repair. 30 In conclusion, this study identified the profile of leukocyte subset influx in the early and late phases following reperfusion and defined two F4/80+ populations in the kidney: resident DCs and macrophages. CCR2 and CX3CR1 signaling pathways play critical roles in inflamed monocyte recruitment in kidney IRI ( Figure 7 ). Resident DCs participate in innate immunity through natural killer T-cell activation 28 and modulate adaptive immunity. 31 These studies provide new insight into mechanisms of early innate immune response to acute kidney IRI, concepts that may generalize to other organs and provide the foundation for therapeutic strategies.
