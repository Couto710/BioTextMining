Why do persons with rheumatoid arthritis still die prematurely?  Conclusion In conclusion, three lines of evidence can explain why persons with RA die prematurely and why the mortality gap between RA and the general population appears to be widening. First, not only do persons with RA have a higher risk of multiple comorbid conditions but persons with RA tend to experience worse outcomes following the occurrence of these comorbid illnesses. Second, persons with RA may not receive optimal primary or secondary preventive care. And third, the systemic inflammation and immune dysfunction associated with RA appears to promote and accelerate comorbidity and mortality. These findings indicate that effective, even optimal control of traditional risk factors alone, while important, will be insufficient in reducing the excess mortality in RA. In order to eliminate premature death in persons with RA, a new research strategy is needed that is specifically focused on this goal. Such studies should investigate the role of tight control of inflammation as an intervention and the impact of comorbidity on outcome; and should include large, simple, randomized control trials complemented by well designed observational studies.
