Role of c-Met in Cancer: Emphasis on Lung Cancer  CONCLUSION In summary, the c-Met receptor is highly expressed and activated in cancers. Its activity is augmented by synergism with other proteins, such as paxillin, or with EGFR in lung cancer. Several inhibitors appear promising in early clinical trials. The outcome of these trials will determine their utility in treating these cancers.
