Gestational cigarette smoke exposure and hyperthermic enhancement of laryngeal chemoreflex in rat pups Laryngeal chemoreflex (LCR) apnea occurs in infant mammals of many species in response to water or other liquids in the laryngeal lumen. The apnea can last for many seconds, sometimes leading to dangerous hypoxemia, and has therefore been considered as a possible mechanism in the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). We have found recently that this reflex is markedly prolonged in decerebrate piglets and anesthetized rat pups that are warmed 1–3 °C above their normal body temperatures. We intermittently exposed pregnant rats to cigarette smoke and examined the LCR in their four- to fifteen-day-old offspring under general anesthesia, with and without whole body warming. During warming, pups of gestationally smoke-exposed dams had significantly longer LCR-induced respiratory disruption than similarly warmed control pups. The results may be significant for the pathogenesis and/or prevention of SIDS as maternal cigarette smoking during human pregnancy and heat stress in infants are known risk factors for SIDS.
