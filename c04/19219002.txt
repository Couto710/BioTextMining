Who and where is the renal baroreceptor?: the connexin hypothesis Gap junctions are emerging as a fundamental mechanism for the control of renin synthesis and release. Connexin40 is prominent in juxtaglomerular cells. When missing, it results in hyperreninemia and hypertension. Schweda et al. offer exciting data demonstrating that connexin45, a connexin with different biophysical properties, can replace connexin40 functions related to the control of renin.
