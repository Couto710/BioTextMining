The G? i AND G? q Proteins Mediate the Effects of Melatonin on Steroid/Thyroid Hormone Receptor Transcriptional Activity and Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation Melatonin, via its MT1 receptor, but not the MT2 receptor, can modulate the transcriptional activity of various nuclear receptors (ER? and RAR?, but not ER?) in MCF-7, T47D and ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cell lines. The anti-proliferative and nuclear receptor modulatory actions of melatonin are mediated via the MT1 G protein-coupled receptor expressed in human breast cancer cells. However, the specific G proteins and associated pathways involved in nuclear receptor transcriptional regulation by melatonin are not yet clear. Upon activation, the MT1 receptor specifically couples to the G?i2, G?i3, G?q and G?ll proteins, and via activation of G?i2 proteins, melatonin suppresses forskolin-induced cyclic AMP (cAMP) production, while melatonin activation of G?q, is able to inhibit phospholipid hydrolysis and ATP’s induction of inositol triphosphate (IP3) production in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Employing dominant-negative (DN) and dominant-positive (DP) forms of these G proteins we demonstrate that G?i2 proteins mediate the suppression of estrogen-induced ER? transcriptional activity by melatonin, while the Gq protein mediates the enhancement of retinoid-induced RAR? transcriptional activity by melatonin. However, the growth-inhibitory actions of melatonin are mediated via both G?i2 and G?q proteins.  Introduction It has been shown that melatonin at physiologic concentrations inhibits the growth of ER?-positive human breast cancer cell lines, including MCF-7 cells [ 1 ]. The majority of the growth-inhibitory actions of melatonin on breast cancer cells appear to be mediated through the MT1 G protein-coupled membrane melatonin receptor [ 2 ]. Activation of MT1 melatonin receptors by melatonin appears to modulate a variety of G-proteins, which subsequently impact a variety of the signal transduction pathways. The heterotrimeric G-proteins activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) generally release two groups of activating subunits: a GTP-bound form of the ? subunit as well as a ?? dimer [ 3 ], both can act individually or simultaneously as the signal transducers [ 4 ]. Considering the well-known function of G-protein ? subunits in GPCR signaling, this study focuses on the role of the G? subunit on melatonin receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Each activated GTP-bound G? subunit belongs to a different G-protein subfamily termed Gs, Gi, Gq and G12/13, which in turn act on individual effectors, including adenylate cyclase (AC), phosphodiesterase (PDE), phospholipase C (PLC) or ion channels to further affect the levels of associated second messengers such as cAMP, cGMP, inositol triphosphate (IP3), and calcium [ 5 ]. Previous reports have demonstrated that melatonin, through activation of MT1 G protein-coupled melatonin receptor, regulates a number of these different downstream second messengers in a variety of tissues [ 6 – 14 ]. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we have previously reported that melatonin inhibits estrogen-, forskolin (Fsk)- or pituitary adenylate cyclase activating protein (PACAP) -induced increase of cAMP [ 7 ]. This inhibitory action appears to be mediated through the membrane G?i protein-coupled MT1 receptor, since in most cases the inhibitory effect of melatonin on cAMP levels is pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive [ 8 ]. Melatonin can blunt and/or block the stimulation of cAMP by forskolin or PACAP without prior stimulation of cAMP, but does not repress the basal level of cAMP [ 9 , 10 ]. Finally, our laboratory has previously reported that melatonin treatment enhances intracellular calcium levels [Ca2+]i induced by ATP, implying the possible involvement of melatonin in phosphoinositol breakdown in MCF-7 breast cancer cells [ 15 ]. Also, MLT regulates ER? membrane signaling. We [ 16 ] and others [ 17 ] have previously reported that melatonin can regulate the transcriptional activity of a number of steroid receptors, such as estrogen receptor alpha (ER?), retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR?), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and the retinoic acid related orphan receptor alpha (ROR?) [ 16 – 20 ]. Kiefer et al. [ 7 ] demonstrated that the effects of melatonin on ER? transcriptional activity involve PTX-sensitive G-protein mechanisms. Currently, we have not delineated the specific G-proteins or the specific downstream signaling pathways through which melatonin differentially regulates the transcriptional activity of these steroid/thyroid hormone receptors. In the following set of experiments, we begin to define which G-proteins couple to the MT1 receptor and the specific second messengers (i.e. cAMP, cGMP, IP3, etc.) that transduce the effect of melatonin on steroid/thyroid hormone receptors to differentially modulate their transcriptional activity in MCF-7 cells.

Fifty microliters of protein A-agarose beads were added to the cell lysate, and the suspension was rotated overnight at 4° C. After centrifugation for at 12,000 × g at 4° C for 20 sec, the beads were washed twice in lysis buffer at 4° C for 20 min, followed by washes in a high salt washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM sodium chloride, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitors) for 20 min at 4° C, then one wash in low salt washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitors) for 20 min at 4° C. Finally, protein A-agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4° C for 20 s, and denatured in 25 µl sample loading buffer as described above. The proteins were electrophoretically separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Hybond membranes.

Cells were treated with either melatonin (10 nM), E2 (1 nM) or transfected with a DP-G?i2 expression construct in the presence of [32P]-orthophosphate (50 µCi/ml) for 4 h. Cells were then rinsed in cold PBS and harvested in 40 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. The cells were lysed for 1 h in 500 ml of 50 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 8.0, 1% NP-40, 2% Sarkosyl, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 100 µM sodium vanadate, 10 mM sodium molybdate, 20 mM sodium fluoride, leupeptin, aprotinin and PMSF. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4° C and the supernatant used for immunprecipitation. Phosporylated ER? was measured by immunoprecipitating total ER? with the H222 ER? (2.5 µg) [Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL] and the resulting immunoprecipitate was run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted overnight onto Hybond-C membrane. The phosphorylation state of the ER? was determined by exposure of the membrane to the P5747 anti-phosphoserine antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) at a 1:300 dilution. Total ER? levels were determined using the C-134 Abbott anti-ER? antibody.  Whole cell lysate preparation and Western blot analysis Whole cell lysates were extracted from MCF-7 breast cancer cells maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. After washing with ice-cooled PBS, the cells were incubated in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors), homogenized by 10 strokes of a dounce homogenizer, and incubated for one hour at 4° C. To remove the insoluble components, the homogenized suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4° C. Whole cell lysates (70 µg per sample) were denatured in sample loading buffer (70 mM Tris pH6.8, 2% SDS, 4 M urea, 40 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue) for 5 min at 80° C, separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and then transferred onto a Hybond membrane (Hybond-ECL, Amersham pharmacia, NJ). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T20 buffer (10 mM Tris, pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) for one hour at room temperature, and then incubated with a variety of anti-G-protein polyclonal antibodies (G?i1, G?i2, G?i3, G?q, G?11, G?o, G?z, G?12, and G?16) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) (1:1000) with TBS-T20 containing 5% non-fat milk for one hour at room temperature. After several washes with TBS-T20 buffer, the membranes were incubated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG, or HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) at a dilution of 1:2000 with TBS-T20 containing 5% non-fat milk for 45 min. After several washes in TBS-T20 buffer, the immunoreactive proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia, NJ) and exposure of membrane to Kodak BIOMAX film.  Whole cell extracts and co-immunoprecipitation assays The MCF-7 cells stably transfected with and over-expressing the MT1 receptor (MT1-MCF-7) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, and treated with 10 nM melatonin or vehicle (0.001% ethanol) for 30 min, then washed twice with ice-cold PBS. For melatonin-treated samples, all subsequent steps were performed in the presence of 10 nM melatonin. The cells were incubated with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitors), scraped with a rubber policeman and homogenized by 10 strokes of the dounce homogenizer. The homogenized cellular lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4° C and the supernatant was pre-adsorbed with 50 µl protein A-agarose beads (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) for at least 3 h at 4° C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 s at 4° C. Whole cell lysates were incubated with the MT1 536 anti-body (kindly provided by Dr. Ralf Jockers, Paris, France) at a dilution 1:50 for one hour at 4° C. Fifty microliters of protein A-agarose beads were added to the cell lysate, and the suspension was rotated overnight at 4° C. After centrifugation for at 12,000 × g at 4° C for 20 sec, the beads were washed twice in lysis buffer at 4° C for 20 min, followed by washes in a high salt washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM sodium chloride, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitors) for 20 min at 4° C, then one wash in low salt washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitors) for 20 min at 4° C. Finally, protein A-agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4° C for 20 s, and denatured in 25 µl sample loading buffer as described above. The proteins were electrophoretically separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Hybond membranes. The co-immunoprecipitated G-proteins were detected by Western blot analysis as described above using a variety of anti-G-protein antibodies at a 1:500 dilution.  Cyclic AMP radioimmunoassay MCF-7 cells grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells per well. On the day following plating, the cells were transiently transfected with either DN- or DP-G-proteins described as above. Twenty-four hours following transfection, the cells were rinsed and re-fed with serum-free RPMI 1640 for an additional 24 h. The cells transfected with DN-G-proteins were pre-treated with 0.1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) for 10 min, and then treated for 10 min with vehicle (0.1% DMSO), melatonin (10 nM), forskolin (1 µM), or melatonin and forskolin, simultaneously. Cells transfected with DP-G-proteins were pretreated with 0.1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) for 10 min and then with either vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or forskolin (1 µM) for 10 min. The cells were lysed in ice-cold 100% ethanol and cell lysates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4° C. The supernatants were concentrated in a Speed-Vac (Savant, Farmingdale, NY) and the dried extracts were re-suspended in 200 µl of cAMP assay buffer (0.05 M acetate buffer, pH5.8) and 1:1000 dilution of extract was analyzed for cAMP levels using the cAMP- [125I] assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.  Cyclic GMP radioimmunoassay MCF-7 cells grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells per well. On the following day, the cells were rinsed with RPMI 1640 medium and pre-treated with 0.1 mM IBMX for 10 min, followed by a 10 min treatment with either vehicle (0.001% DMSO), 5-cyclopropyl-2[1(2-fluoro-benzyl)-1H-pyraxolo[3,4-b]pyrimidine-4-ylamine (BAY 41-2272) at a concentration of 1 µM (for 10 min), melatonin (10 nM) or pre-treated with different doses of melatonin (1 nM to 10 µM) followed by BAY 41-2272 for 10 min. After 10 min of BAY 41-2272 treatment the cells were lysed in ice-cold 100% ethanol and lysates were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min at 4° C. The supernatant was concentrated in a Speed Vac and dried extracts re-suspended in 200 µl of cGMP assay buffer (0.05 M acetate buffer, pH5.8). A 1:1000 dilution of cell extract was analyzed for cGMP levels by using the cGMP-[125I] assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as per the manufacturer’s instruction.  Inositol-1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) assay MCF-7 cells grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells per well. On the following day, the cells were transiently transfected with either DN or DP-G-proteins described as above. Twenty-four hours following transfection, the cells were rinsed and re-fed with serum-free RPMI 1640 for an additional 24 h. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were rinsed with RPMI 1640 medium and pre-incubated for 20 min in 10 mM LiCl. The cells were pre-treated with either vehicle (0.001% ethanol) or melatonin (10 nM) for 30 min followed by 100 mM ATP. After 20 min of treatment, the cells were lysed in 3% ice-cold perchloric acid for 20 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min at 4° C. The supernatants were neutralized to pH 7.5 with ice-cold 10 M KOH, and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min at 4° C. The resulting aqueous phase was analyzed using the Inositol-1, 4,5-triphosphate (IP3) [3H] assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont Buckinghamshire, England) as per the manufacturer’s instruction.  Growth study MCF-7 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS in 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours after plating cells were transiently transfected with 50 ng/well of the pcDNA3.1 control vector, DN-G or DP-G-protein plasmids using the FuGENE transfection reagent in serum-free medium. After an 8 h transfection, the cells transfected with DN-G-proteins were re-fed with fresh serum-containing medium and treated with either vehicle (0.001% ethanol) or melatonin (1 nM), while the cells transfected with DP-G-proteins were re-fed with fresh serum-containing medium and treated with vehicle (0.001% ethanol) alone. After 7 days, the cells were harvested with PBS-EDTA, mixed with 2% trypan blue to determine cell viability, and viable cells were counted on a hemacytometer.  Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed for statistical significance using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison tests.  Results We have previously demonstrated that melatonin can suppress estrogen-induced transcriptional activation of the ER? in MCF-7 breast cancer cells [ 7 , 16 ], however, we have not confirmed that this is seen in other ER?-positive human breast cancer cell lines. Therefore, we conducted ERE-luciferase reporter analysis to examine the ability of melatonin to repress E2-induced ER? transactivation in T47D and ZR-75-1 human breast tumor cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1 , pre-treatment of MCF-7 cells with 10 nM melatonin significantly blunted E2-induced ER? transcriptional activation by 42% in MCF-7 cells, 30% in T47D cells and 64% in ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. The suppression of ER? transcriptional activity by melatonin was significantly enhanced in ZR-75-1 cells as compared to T47D cells. To determine if melatonin also represses E2-induced ER? transcriptional activity, we conducted ERE-luciferase reporter assays in HEK293 cells, which do not express endogenous ER?, ER?, MT1, or MT2 receptors. For these studies HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs for ER?, ER? and MT1 or MT2 as well as an ERE-luciferase reporter construct. As shown in Fig. 2 , treatment of transfected HEK293 cells with E2 (1 nM) did not alter ERE-luciferase activity in HEK293 cells transfected with only the ERE-luciferase reporter construct or the pcDNA3.1 vector. However, in cells transfected with the ER? construct, treatment with 1 nM E2 resulted in a 4.2-times increase in luciferase activity and pre-treatment of cells with 10 nM melatonin significantly blunted ER? transcriptional activity by 41%. However, E2 induced a 2.7-times increase in ER? transcriptional activity and this activity was not blunted by melatonin. When HEK293 cells were transfected with ER? and the MT2 melatonin receptor, E2 again induced a 4.6-times increase in ER? activity, but ER? transcriptional activity was not blocked by melatonin when the MT2 receptor was expressed. The ER? demonstrates a basal level of phosphorylation in the absence of ligand, which increases approximately 3.0-times upon stimulation with E2. Analysis of the effect of melatonin and DP-G?i2 protein expression on E2-induced ER? phosphoryation demonstrates that melatonin induces a marked decrease (56%) in basal ER? phosphorylation ( Fig. 3 ). In addition, expression of a DP-G?i2 protein also resulted in a marked diminution (38%) in E2-stimulated ER? phosphorylation. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the growth-inhibitory effects of melatonin on human breast tumor cells are largely mediated through the MT1 G-protein-coupled receptor [ 2 ]. To further clarify the MT1 receptor coupled signaling pathway(s) in breast cancer, we set out to identify which G-proteins coupled to the MT1 receptor in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. First, we identified the endogenous G-proteins expressed in MCF-7 cells using immuno (Western)-blot analyses ( Fig. 4A ). Using whole cell lysates from MCF-7 cells and a panel of anti-G-protein + subunit antibodies, numerous endogenous G-proteins were detected, including G?i1, G?i2, G?i3, G?z, G?o, G?q, G?11, and G?12. However, not all G-proteins appear to be expressed in MCF-7 cells, for example, the G?16 protein, previously reported to couple to the MT1 receptor in MT1-transfected HEK293 cells [ 21 ], was not expressed in MCF-7 cells. Second, we examined which G-protein(s) couple to the MT1 receptor in MCF-7 cells. Considering the low level of expression of the endogenous MT1 receptor in MCF-7 cells, immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted in MT1-MCF-7 cells stably transfected with and over-expressing the human MT1 melatonin receptor and wild type of G-proteins. As shown in Fig. 4B , melatonin treatment stimulated the G?i2, G?i3, G?q, and G?11 proteins, but not the G?o and G?z to couple to and co-immunoprecipitate with the MT1 receptor. To demonstrate that the endogenously expressed G-proteins couple to the activated MT1 receptor, we repeated our co-immunoprecipitation studies in MT1-MCF-7 cells and treated the cells with either vehicle or 1 nM melatonin for 30 min. Fig. 4C shows that endogenously expressed G?i2, G?i3, G?q and G?11 proteins indeed couple to and co-immunoprecipitate with the melatonin-activated MT1 receptor in MCF-7 cells. Melatonin has previously been shown in tissues other than the breast, to negatively regulate intracellular cAMP levels [ 6 , 8 ], and down-stream components of the cAMP-signaling pathway including PKA activity and CREB phosphorylation [ 22 ]. As well, G?i proteins are also known to negatively regulate cAMP signaling, including repressing Fsk-induced cAMP accumulation through PTX-sensitive mechanism [ 8 ]. Therefore, we employed a cAMP radioimmunoassay assay to determine if MT1 receptor-coupled Gi or Gq proteins are involved in mediating melatonin inhibition of cAMP levels induced by Fsk in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 5 , stimulation of MCF-7 cells with Fsk (1 µM) induced an approximately eight-fold increase in cAMP levels. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with melatonin alone had no significant effect on basal levels of cAMP, however, pre-treatment of MCF-7 cells for 10 min with melatonin (10 nM) significantly blunted (by 50%) the increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations induced by Fsk. Furthermore, melatonin inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation was blocked by the expression of DN-G?i1/2, DN-G?i3, and DN-G?11 proteins, but not the DN-G?q protein ( Fig. 5A ). Conversely, DP-G?i2, DP-G?i3, and DP-G?11 proteins ( Fig. 5B ), but not the DN-G?q protein significantly inhibited Fsk-induced cAMP accumulation. It has been reported that melatonin elevates the levels of cGMP in mammary tissue [ 23 ], but the effect of melatonin on the level of cGMP has not been examined in breast cancer cells. To test whether MT1 receptor activation modulates the cGMP signaling pathway, MCF-7 cells expressing endogenous MT1 receptor were incubated in the presence of the non-specific inhibitor of phosphodiesterases IBMX and then treated with either DMSO, 5-Cyclopropyl-2[1(2-fluoro-benzyl)]-1H-pyraxolo[3,4-b]pyrimdin-4-ylamine (BAY 41-2272), a known inducer of cGMP, melatonin or pre-treated with melatonin for 5 min followed by BAY 41-2272 [ 24 ]. BAY 41-2272 induced a significant 2.1-times increase in intracellular cGMP levels, while melatonin treatment alone (10 nM) did not affect of the cGMP levels in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, pre-treatment of cells with various doses of melatonin (1 nM to 10 µM) did not affect the BAY 41-2272-induced elevation of intracellular cGMP levels, (data not shown). Previous data from our laboratory has shown that melatonin can potentiate ATP-induced stimulation and accumulation of intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, but melatonin alone does not alter the basal levels of [Ca2+]i [ 15 ]. This result suggests the involvement of the G?q/11-coupled signaling pathways in the regulation of [Ca2+]i. To determine if IP3, or G?q/11 activated PLC pathway is modulated by melatonin, MCF-7 cells were pre-treated with LiCl for 20 min to block the degradation of IP3 as measured with the D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate assay. To evaluate the effect of melatonin on IP3 levels in MCF-7 cells, we examined the effect of melatonin on either basal levels of IP3 or ATP-induced IP3 levels. As shown in Fig. 6 , stimulation of MCF-7 cells with 100 mM ATP induced approximately a 3.0-times increase in IP3 levels. Melatonin (10 nM) had no significant effect on basal IP3 levels, however, pre-treatment of MCF-7 cells for 5 min with melatonin (10 nM) significantly blunted (by 52%) the increase in IP3 levels induced by ATP. Furthermore, the expression of DN-G?q and DN-G?11 proteins, but not the DN-G?i2 and DN-G?i3 proteins blocked melatonin-induced inhibition of ATP-induced IP3 accumulation. Conversely, DP-G?q and DP-G?11 proteins, but not the DP-G?i2 and DP-G?i3 proteins, significantly inhibited ATP-induced IP3 levels by 50% and 59%, respectively. Previous reports have shown that melatonin can repress E2-induced ER?-dependent transcriptional activity in MCF-7 cells [ 7 , 16 , 25 ]. Since both PTX-sensitive and-insensitive G-proteins have been shown to couple to the MT1 receptor, we examined whether the functional coupling between MT1 receptor and specific G-proteins affects ER? transcriptional activity. Treatment of MCF-7 cells transfected with ERE-luciferase reporter construct and a control vector with melatonin produced no significant change in luciferase activity, whereas E2 treatment induced 3.46-times increase in luciferase activity ( Fig. 7A ). However, pre-treatment with melatonin for 30 min. followed by E2 for 18 hours resulted in the 40% inhibition of ER? transcriptional activity compared to the cells treated with 1 nM E2 ( Fig. 7A ). The expression of DN-G?i2 protein, but not the DN-G?i3, DN-G?q or DN-G?11 proteins blocked the ability of melatonin to repress E2-induced ER? transcriptional activity. Conversely, expression of a DP-G?i2 protein mimicked the inhibitory effect of melatonin, repressing E2-induced ER? transactivation by approximately 50% compared to control cells stimulated with E2 ( Fig. 7B ). In order to elucidate whether melatonin can regulate RAR? transcriptional activity through the G protein-coupled MT1 receptor and its associated G-protein signaling pathways, MCF-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with DN- or DP-G-proteins, and a RARE-luciferase reporter construct and treated with vehicle (0.001% ethanol), melatonin (10 nM), at RA (1 nM), or melatonin followed by at RA as described in materials and methods. As shown in Fig. 8 in the cells transfected with the control G-protein vector, melatonin treatment alone did not modulate basal RAR? transcriptional activity, while at RA stimulated a 3.46-times increase in luciferase activity. However, administration of melatonin 5 min prior to at RA, significantly enhanced at RA-induced RAR? transactivation by approximately 54%. The enhancement of at RA-induced RAR? transactivation by melatonin was blocked by the expression of either DN-G?q or DN-G?11 proteins, but not DN-G?i1/2 or DN-G?i3 proteins ( Fig. 8A ). The expression of the constitutively active DP-G?q or DP-G?11, but not DP-G?i2 or DP-G?i3 proteins, mimicked the stimulatory effect of melatonin on at RA-induced RAR? transactivation, and enhanced at RA-induced luciferase activity by 46% or 69%, respectively ( Fig. 8B ). We and others have reported that the growth of MCF-7 cells is suppressed by melatonin [ 1 , 26 ]. To define if G-proteins that mediate the actions of melatonin on steroid hormone receptor transcriptional activity also mediate the growth-suppressive effects of melatonin, MCF-7 cells were transfected with either a control vector or a plasmid for the expression of the various DN-G-proteins and treated with either vehicle (0.001% ethanol) or melatonin (10 nM) for 7 days. Fig. 9A demonstrates that melatonin significantly suppresses cell proliferation by 43% in MCF-7 cells transfected with the control vector. The expression of DN-G?i2, DN-G?i3, or DN-G?q proteins blocked the growth-inhibitory activity of melatonin. To further establish the involvement of these G-proteins in the melatonin response pathway, we examined the effect of melatonin on MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with DP-G-proteins. Expression of either the DP-G?i2 or DP-G?q protein, but not DP-G?i3 or DP-G?11 protein, mimicked the inhibitory effect of melatonin on MCF-7 cell growth, suppressing cell numbers by 45% or 48%, respectively ( Fig. 9 A and B ). Thus, the growth-inhibitory effect of melatonin on MCF-7 cells appears to be mediated via the activation of both G?i2 and G?q proteins.  Results We have previously demonstrated that melatonin can suppress estrogen-induced transcriptional activation of the ER? in MCF-7 breast cancer cells [ 7 , 16 ], however, we have not confirmed that this is seen in other ER?-positive human breast cancer cell lines. Therefore, we conducted ERE-luciferase reporter analysis to examine the ability of melatonin to repress E2-induced ER? transactivation in T47D and ZR-75-1 human breast tumor cell lines.

As shown in Fig. 2 , treatment of transfected HEK293 cells with E2 (1 nM) did not alter ERE-luciferase activity in HEK293 cells transfected with only the ERE-luciferase reporter construct or the pcDNA3.1 vector. However, in cells transfected with the ER? construct, treatment with 1 nM E2 resulted in a 4.2-times increase in luciferase activity and pre-treatment of cells with 10 nM melatonin significantly blunted ER? transcriptional activity by 41%.

When HEK293 cells were transfected with ER? and the MT2 melatonin receptor, E2 again induced a 4.6-times increase in ER? activity, but ER? transcriptional activity was not blocked by melatonin when the MT2 receptor was expressed. The ER? demonstrates a basal level of phosphorylation in the absence of ligand, which increases approximately 3.0-times upon stimulation with E2. Analysis of the effect of melatonin and DP-G?i2 protein expression on E2-induced ER? phosphoryation demonstrates that melatonin induces a marked decrease (56%) in basal ER? phosphorylation ( Fig. 3 ). In addition, expression of a DP-G?i2 protein also resulted in a marked diminution (38%) in E2-stimulated ER? phosphorylation.

As shown in Fig. 4B , melatonin treatment stimulated the G?i2, G?i3, G?q, and G?11 proteins, but not the G?o and G?z to couple to and co-immunoprecipitate with the MT1 receptor. To demonstrate that the endogenously expressed G-proteins couple to the activated MT1 receptor, we repeated our co-immunoprecipitation studies in MT1-MCF-7 cells and treated the cells with either vehicle or 1 nM melatonin for 30 min. Fig. 4C shows that endogenously expressed G?i2, G?i3, G?q and G?11 proteins indeed couple to and co-immunoprecipitate with the melatonin-activated MT1 receptor in MCF-7 cells.

Treatment of MCF-7 cells with melatonin alone had no significant effect on basal levels of cAMP, however, pre-treatment of MCF-7 cells for 10 min with melatonin (10 nM) significantly blunted (by 50%) the increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations induced by Fsk. Furthermore, melatonin inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation was blocked by the expression of DN-G?i1/2, DN-G?i3, and DN-G?11 proteins, but not the DN-G?q protein ( Fig. 5A ). Conversely, DP-G?i2, DP-G?i3, and DP-G?11 proteins ( Fig. 5B ), but not the DN-G?q protein significantly inhibited Fsk-induced cAMP accumulation. It has been reported that melatonin elevates the levels of cGMP in mammary tissue [ 23 ], but the effect of melatonin on the level of cGMP has not been examined in breast cancer cells. To test whether MT1 receptor activation modulates the cGMP signaling pathway, MCF-7 cells expressing endogenous MT1 receptor were incubated in the presence of the non-specific inhibitor of phosphodiesterases IBMX and then treated with either DMSO, 5-Cyclopropyl-2[1(2-fluoro-benzyl)]-1H-pyraxolo[3,4-b]pyrimdin-4-ylamine (BAY 41-2272), a known inducer of cGMP, melatonin or pre-treated with melatonin for 5 min followed by BAY 41-2272 [ 24 ]. BAY 41-2272 induced a significant 2.1-times increase in intracellular cGMP levels, while melatonin treatment alone (10 nM) did not affect of the cGMP levels in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, pre-treatment of cells with various doses of melatonin (1 nM to 10 µM) did not affect the BAY 41-2272-induced elevation of intracellular cGMP levels, (data not shown). Previous data from our laboratory has shown that melatonin can potentiate ATP-induced stimulation and accumulation of intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, but melatonin alone does not alter the basal levels of [Ca2+]i [ 15 ].

To evaluate the effect of melatonin on IP3 levels in MCF-7 cells, we examined the effect of melatonin on either basal levels of IP3 or ATP-induced IP3 levels. As shown in Fig. 6 , stimulation of MCF-7 cells with 100 mM ATP induced approximately a 3.0-times increase in IP3 levels. Melatonin (10 nM) had no significant effect on basal IP3 levels, however, pre-treatment of MCF-7 cells for 5 min with melatonin (10 nM) significantly blunted (by 52%) the increase in IP3 levels induced by ATP. Furthermore, the expression of DN-G?q and DN-G?11 proteins, but not the DN-G?i2 and DN-G?i3 proteins blocked melatonin-induced inhibition of ATP-induced IP3 accumulation. Conversely, DP-G?q and DP-G?11 proteins, but not the DP-G?i2 and DP-G?i3 proteins, significantly inhibited ATP-induced IP3 levels by 50% and 59%, respectively. Previous reports have shown that melatonin can repress E2-induced ER?-dependent transcriptional activity in MCF-7 cells [ 7 , 16 , 25 ]. Since both PTX-sensitive and-insensitive G-proteins have been shown to couple to the MT1 receptor, we examined whether the functional coupling between MT1 receptor and specific G-proteins affects ER? transcriptional activity. Treatment of MCF-7 cells transfected with ERE-luciferase reporter construct and a control vector with melatonin produced no significant change in luciferase activity, whereas E2 treatment induced 3.46-times increase in luciferase activity ( Fig. 7A ). However, pre-treatment with melatonin for 30 min. followed by E2 for 18 hours resulted in the 40% inhibition of ER? transcriptional activity compared to the cells treated with 1 nM E2 ( Fig. 7A ). The expression of DN-G?i2 protein, but not the DN-G?i3, DN-G?q or DN-G?11 proteins blocked the ability of melatonin to repress E2-induced ER? transcriptional activity. Conversely, expression of a DP-G?i2 protein mimicked the inhibitory effect of melatonin, repressing E2-induced ER? transactivation by approximately 50% compared to control cells stimulated with E2 ( Fig. 7B ). In order to elucidate whether melatonin can regulate RAR? transcriptional activity through the G protein-coupled MT1 receptor and its associated G-protein signaling pathways, MCF-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with DN- or DP-G-proteins, and a RARE-luciferase reporter construct and treated with vehicle (0.001% ethanol), melatonin (10 nM), at RA (1 nM), or melatonin followed by at RA as described in materials and methods. As shown in Fig. 8 in the cells transfected with the control G-protein vector, melatonin treatment alone did not modulate basal RAR? transcriptional activity, while at RA stimulated a 3.46-times increase in luciferase activity. However, administration of melatonin 5 min prior to at RA, significantly enhanced at RA-induced RAR? transactivation by approximately 54%. The enhancement of at RA-induced RAR? transactivation by melatonin was blocked by the expression of either DN-G?q or DN-G?11 proteins, but not DN-G?i1/2 or DN-G?i3 proteins ( Fig. 8A ). The expression of the constitutively active DP-G?q or DP-G?11, but not DP-G?i2 or DP-G?i3 proteins, mimicked the stimulatory effect of melatonin on at RA-induced RAR? transactivation, and enhanced at RA-induced luciferase activity by 46% or 69%, respectively ( Fig. 8B ). We and others have reported that the growth of MCF-7 cells is suppressed by melatonin [ 1 , 26 ]. To define if G-proteins that mediate the actions of melatonin on steroid hormone receptor transcriptional activity also mediate the growth-suppressive effects of melatonin, MCF-7 cells were transfected with either a control vector or a plasmid for the expression of the various DN-G-proteins and treated with either vehicle (0.001% ethanol) or melatonin (10 nM) for 7 days. Fig. 9A demonstrates that melatonin significantly suppresses cell proliferation by 43% in MCF-7 cells transfected with the control vector. The expression of DN-G?i2, DN-G?i3, or DN-G?q proteins blocked the growth-inhibitory activity of melatonin. To further establish the involvement of these G-proteins in the melatonin response pathway, we examined the effect of melatonin on MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with DP-G-proteins. Expression of either the DP-G?i2 or DP-G?q protein, but not DP-G?i3 or DP-G?11 protein, mimicked the inhibitory effect of melatonin on MCF-7 cell growth, suppressing cell numbers by 45% or 48%, respectively ( Fig. 9 A and B ). Thus, the growth-inhibitory effect of melatonin on MCF-7 cells appears to be mediated via the activation of both G?i2 and G?q proteins.  Discussion In this study, we employed human breast cancer cell lines that express endogenous MT1 receptor to demonstrate the different mechanisms regulating the transcriptional activity of ER? and RAR? in response to melatonin and to elucidate the underlying signaling pathways leading to the growth-inhibitory actions of melatonin in breast cancer. The starting point for our study was to determine if melatonin modulated ER? transcriptional activity in human breast cancer cell lines other than MCF-7 cells and if melatonin also modulated the transcriptional activity of ER?. From our studies presented in figures 1 and 2 , melatonin is able to repress E2-induced ER? transcriptional activity in three different ER?-positive MCF-7, T47D and ZR-75-1 cell lines, however, the actions of melatonin on ER? transcriptional activity was significantly greater in MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells as compared to T47D cells. This however, is not due to expression differences in the MT1 melatonin receptor in the two lines, as we have already demonstrated [ 27 ] that ZR-75-1 and T47D cells express equivalent levels of MT1 at the mRNA level, but both express somewhat lower levels of the MT1 receptor than the MCF-7 cells. We have previously reported that in a panel of 25 primary breast tumors, varying levels of MT1-melatonin receptor mRNA is expressed in the different breast tumors and breast cancer cell lines, with levels ranging from high, to very low. Furthermore, a recent report by Dillon et al. [ 28 ] has demonstrated that the melatonin MT1 receptor is expressed at different levels in different human breast tumors. Our current report is also the first to demonstrate that melatonin via its MT1 receptor, but not the MT2 receptor, represses E2-induced transcriptional activity of ER?, but not ER?. We next set out to identify which G-proteins coupled to the MT1 receptor in MCF-7 breast cancer cells using co-immunoprecipitation assays. Our data demonstrate that the MT1 receptor couples with a limited set of G-proteins including: G?i2, G?i3, G?q and G?11 proteins, but does not couple with other G-proteins including G?i1, G?o, G?z, and G?12, which are also expressed in MCF-7 cells. The coupling of these G-proteins (G?i2, G?i3, G?q and G?11) is strictly melatonin dependent since MT1 receptor-G-protein complexes are not observed in the absence of melatonin. Our results confirm the previous report that G?i2, G?i3 and G?q/11 proteins coupled to the MT1 receptor in a melatonin-dependent and guanine nucleotide-sensitive manner in HEK293 cells expressing exogenous MT1 receptor [ 21 ]. Receptors with dual signaling properties often stimulate different pathways with different efficacy. In previous work, we reported that melatonin differentially regulates the transcriptional activity of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, suppressing ER?, ROR? and GR ligand-induced transcriptional activity while potentiating RAR?-induced transcriptional activity in MCF-7 cells [ 7 , 16 ]. The concept that different G-proteins mediating different signaling pathways might be responsible for this differential response of nuclear receptors to melatonin is suggested by G-protein uncoupling studies using PTX treatment. Pre-treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with PTX, which inhibits Gi protein function by ADP-ribosylation of the GDP-bounded ? subunit of Gi protein [ 29 , 30 ], effectively abrogates the inhibitory effect of melatonin on estrogen-dependent ER? transcriptional activity, but does not affect the stimulatory effect of melatonin on at RA-dependent RAR? transcriptional activity in MCF-7 cells. As well, our current results indicate that multiple heterotrimeric G-proteins (G?i2, G?q and G?11) are involved in regulating the differential melatonin-dependent modulation of ER? and RAR?. The above data indicate that G?i2 and/or G?i3 are effectors for melatonin’s modulation of ER? signaling, whereas PTX-insensitive G?q and G?11 proteins are effectors for melatonin’s modulation of RAR? signaling pathway in breast cancer. Melatonin can inhibit Fsk-induced cAMP levels and ATP-induced IP3 levels, but does not affect cGMP levels in breast cancer cells. As for melatonin regulation of ATP-induced IP3 levels, this action is mediated via activation of G?q and G?11 proteins, but not G?i2 or G?i3 proteins. These results are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that melatonin can modulate several G-protein-coupled intracellular signal pathways, including the cAMP [ 9 ], PKC/calcium [ 15 , 30 ], and MAP kinase cascades [ 31 ], which are the key second messengers in signaling systems known to modify the transcriptional activity of steroid receptors. In breast cancer cells, it has been reported that activation of the cAMP signaling pathway can lead to ligand-dependent and ligand-independent phosphorylation of ER?, and stimulation of ER? transcriptional activity [ 32 ]. In sertoli cells, it has been reported that PKC activation can induce ligand-independent RAR? transcriptional activity and modify ligand-dependent RAR? transcriptional activity [ 33 ]. These studies demonstrate the critical connection of the different G-proteins to steroid hormone receptor transcriptional activity. Transient-transfection studies with DN- and DP-G-protein constructs demonstrate the specific action of G?i2 as the mediator of melatonin’s effect on ER? transcriptional activity, and the role of G?q and G?11 as the mediators of melatonin’s effect on RAR? activity. Furthermore, the ability of a DP-G?i2 to mimic melatonin’s suppression of E2-induced ER? phosphorylation, suggests that melatonin via the MT1 receptor and activation of G?i2 alters ER? transcriptional activity via modulation of ER? phosphorylation. This however, does not exclude the possibility of melatonin’s modulation of ER? transcriptional activity through phosphorylation changes in ER? co-activators (CBP, Src-1 or Calmodulin). It is well established that nuclear and steroid hormone receptors are targets for regulation by “cross talk” from other signaling pathways [ 34 – 36 ]. Modulation of G-proteins in MCF-7 cells by melatonin may result in the selective phosphorylation and activation of specific steroid/thyroid hormone receptors or other transcription factors. In these studies, we have attempted to establish whether the MT1-coupled G-proteins are responsible for inhibition of MCF-7 cell growth by using a selective competitive G-protein agonist and antagonist. First, the observation that PTX prevents melatonin-induced suppression of PC12 pheochromocytoma cancer cell growth strongly implies that the MT1 receptor via G?i proteins mediates the anti-proliferative action of melatonin [ 37 ]. Studies in which we over-expressed DN-G?i2 and DN-G?q suggest that not one, but both the G?i2 and G?q proteins play important roles in mediating melatonin’s growth inhibitory activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We have previously reported that at least part of melatonin’s anti-proliferative and E2-inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells is mediated via suppression of E2’s non-genomic induction of cAMP [ 7 ]. The above data suggests that the down-regulation of cAMP, by melatonin, may be an initiating biochemical event in suppressing breast cancer cell proliferation. This concept is supported by studies with PC12 pheochromocytoma cell A126-1B2-1 mutants with significantly diminished PKA activity (80% reduction compared to controls), which is unresponsive to the growth-suppressive actions of melatonin [ 37 ]. To date, the exact pathway(s) downstream of the MT1 receptor that mediate breast cancer growth inhibition in MCF-7 cells, have not been definitively elucidated. Our findings demonstrate that the MT1 receptor-mediated growth-inhibitory effect of melatonin involves both the activation and suppression of the transcriptional activity of specific steroid/thyroid hormone receptors and their regulation of growth-modulatory genes via multiple G-protein coupled signal transduction pathways. In general, melatonin acts as an anti-mitogenic molecule suppressing ER? signaling and potentiating the transcriptional activity of RAR? to inhibit breast tumor cell growth. Previous studies have already shown that melatonin cross talks with the estrogen signaling pathways in breast cancer, by inhibiting the expression of ER? mRNA via transcription-related events [ 18 ] decreasing the ER?-ERE complex binding stability [ 16 ], and further suppressing E2-induced ER? transcriptional activity of ER? [ 20 ]. A recent report by Del Rio et al. [ 25 ], has demonstrated that calmodulin (CaM) is essential for melatonin’s suppression of ER? transcriptional activity. This work, does not conflict with our data demonstrating that melatonin mediates ER? transcriptional activity via activation of a G?i2 signaling pathway, as we have previously reported that melatonin can modulate CaM localization, shifting CaM from the nucleus to the cell membrane [ 15 ]. These data combined with numerous reports that G?i proteins can regulate many second messengers including cAMP and intracellular calcium, and CaM’s reported actions as an ER? co-activator [ 25 ] suggest that melatonin modulation of CaM, although involved in regulation of ER? function, is clearly down-stream of melatonin’s action on G?i2 proteins. In MCF-7 cells, it has been shown that melatonin enhances at RA-induced RAR? transcriptional activity using RARE-luciferase reporter assay without interfering with the expression of RAR? [ 38 ]. The synergism between melatonin and the RAR? signaling pathway was also demonstrated in the N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU)-induced rat mammary tumor model, where melatonin sensitizes not only the suppressive effect of retinoic acid on the incidence of NMU-induced mammary tumor [ 39 ], and also the regression of the carcinogen-induced mammary tumors [ 40 ]. In summary, we have demonstrated that melatonin inhibits E2-induced ER? transcriptional activity in a variety of human breast cancer cell lines, that this effect is specific for ER? and does not affect ER?, and that these effects are mediated via the MT1 and not the MT2 melatonin receptor. MCF-7 breast tumor cells were used to study the role of heterotrimeric G-protein subunits G?i2 and G?q as well as ER? and RAR? activity in the growth of breast cancer cells as they are growth-inhibited by melatonin. Our studies employing DN- and DP-G-proteins show that melatonin differentially regulates ER?, but not ER?, and RAR? transcriptional activity acting through different G-protein-dependent pathways by a mutant G-protein strategy. Although coupling to G?i2 may be essential for some of the actions of melatonin, stimulation of the RAR? signaling pathways seems to require functional coupling between the activated MT1 receptor and the G?q protein family. Our results also suggest that melatonin may regulate breast cancer cell proliferation via these two separate, but interrelated, G-proteins and their downstream signaling partners ( Fig. 9 ). Moreover, expression of the constitutively active mutants of G?i2 and G?q can promote growth inhibition in the absence of melatonin.  Discussion In this study, we employed human breast cancer cell lines that express endogenous MT1 receptor to demonstrate the different mechanisms regulating the transcriptional activity of ER? and RAR? in response to melatonin and to elucidate the underlying signaling pathways leading to the growth-inhibitory actions of melatonin in breast cancer.
