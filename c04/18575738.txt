Somatic alterations in brain tumors Mutations in TP53 and RB1 have been shown to participate in the development of malignant brain tumors. Emerging evidence shows that mutations are involved in LGI1 in brain tumor progression. Herein we present data from the sequencing of a series of high- and low-grade gliomas with matched normal DNA. We report on 35 unique missense mutations in TP53 , RB1 and LGI1 genes and use available information for each mutation in order to classify them as likely to be ‘driver’ or ‘passenger’ mutations. The identification of putatively deleterious mutations in LGI1 supports the notion that this locus may play a role in brain cancer development.  Materials and methods Subjects Forty-three subjects with primary brain tumors were included in the study between May 2002 and July 2004 at the Karmanos Cancer Institute Neuro-oncology clinic and other institutions in the Detroit Metropolitan area, which included hospitals in the Detroit Medical Center system and the Henry Ford Health system. The tumor samples were re-read to ensure that a viable tumor was represented in the samples and to verify histological diagnosis. The DNA from blood or tumor samples was extracted according to established protocols. Therefore, matched tumor DNA (from tumor samples) and normal DNA (from blood samples) was available for each individual. Subsets of these samples were then used to investigate somatic and germline genetic changes in TP53 , LGI1 and RB1 . TP53-sequencing analysis Using a set of 20 matched tumor and normal DNA samples, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assay and DNA sequencing were used to determine the frequency of TP53 mutations in exons 5-9 (accounting for 97% of mutations in tumor DNA). SSCP was performed for all 20 pairs for exons 5-7 and for 10 of these pairs for exons 5-9. Briefly, bidirectional oligonucleotide primers for the PCR amplification of exon 5-8 fragments were synthesized. The sequences for primers used are: 5?-gttcacttgt gccctga-3? and 5?-agccctgtcgtctct-3? for exon 5 (annealing temperature, 56°C); 5?-ctctgattcctcactg-3? and 5?-ccagagac cccagttgcaaacc-3? for exon 6 (annealing temperature, 52°C); 5?-tgcttgccacaggtct-3? and 5?-acagcaggccagtgt-3? for exon 7 (annealing temperature, 58°C); and 5?-aggacctgatttccttac-3? and 5?-tctgaggcataactgc-3? for exon 8 (annealing temperature, 55°C). PCR products were generated in a 30- ? l reaction mixture including 50 ng of DNA, 20 ? M dNTP, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 pmol of each primer, 1 unit Taq, (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT) and 0.2 ? Ci [33P]-dCTP (DuPont New England Nuclear, Boston, MA). DNA with a known TP53 mutation was included as a positive control. The PCR reaction was carried out using 35 cycles (94°C for 30 sec, annealed for 30 sec at various temperatures as indicated above and 72°C for 1 min) on a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermal cycler. PCR product (3 ? l) was mixed with 2 ? l of 0.1 N NaOH and then mixed with 5 ? l of gel loading buffer solution from the United States Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH) and heated at 94°C for 4 min. Gels were run at room temperature for 20 h and exposed for 16 h for the autoradiographic detection of bands. Direct sequencing of PCR fragments for the two DNA strands was performed with aberrant migration patterns on single-strand conformation polymorphism gel to determine the corresponding DNA sequences using a double-strand DNA cycle sequencing system from Life Technologies/Invitrogen, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). The IARC TP53 mutation database ( http://www-p53.iarc.fr/ ) and Hollstein et al ( 7 ) were consulted to determine whether the mutations found in our samples had been reported previously. RB1-sequencing analysis Eight matched normal and tumor DNA samples from the original 20 matched samples were analyzed for RB1 mutations using custom Affymetrix resequencing chips ( www.affymetrix.com ). A multiple sequence alignment was generated using CLUSTAL (Vector NTI) with the following RB orthologs (accession number): Homo sapiens (NP_000312.1), Pan troglodytes (AAK32151.1), Canis familiaris (AAF67147.1), Mus musculus (NP_033055.1), Rattus norvegicus (P33568), Gallus gallus (NP_989750.1), Xenopus laevis (AAB23173.1), Oncorhynchus mykiss (AAD13390.1), Oryzias latipes (AAG21826.1), Fundulus heteroclitus (AAS80140.1), Caenorhabditis elegans (NP_491686.1), Drosophila melanogaster (CAA65661.1), Nicotiana benthamiana (AAU05979.1), Populus tremula (AAF61377.1), Oryza sativa (XP_483552.1) and Cocos nucifera (AAM77469.1). The corresponding amino acid was then identified in the orthologs. The flanking region was also analyzed for conservation. For residues located in regions for which there is a crystal structure ( 8 , 9 ), the amino acid location in the structure was determined (PDB: 1AD6 and 1N4M). LGI1-sequencing analysis The set of 8 matched normal and tumor DNA samples used for RB1 analysis was also analyzed for LGI1 mutations using custom Affymetrix resequencing chips. A multiple sequence alignment was generated using CLUSTAL (Vector NTI) with the following LGI1 orthologs (accession number): Homo sapiens (NP_005088), Mus musculus (NP_064674), Bos taurus (AAX08851) and Rattus norvegicus (NP_665712). The corresponding amino acid was then identified in the orthologs. The flanking region was also analyzed for conservation.

Results Tumor mutations We identified 38 missense and non-sense changes (38 unique) in 11 samples from brain tumors ( Table I ). Low-grade gliomas showed a limited number of mutations in the loci studied while the vast majority of high-grade gliomas displayed multiple mutations ( Table I ). TP53 mutations During the sequence analysis of exons 5-7 we identified 4 changes representing 3 unique missense variants while the analysis of exons 8-9 showed only 1 ( Table II ). The mutation found in an African-American sample, His179Arg, was the same as the one in a Caucasian sample. None of these variants were found in the normal matched controls. All five mutations have previously been reported ( http://www-p53.iarc.fr/ ) and are expected to impact protein function. RB1 mutations We obtained sequencing information from 8 brain tumor samples and compared it with normal samples. Brain tumor samples showed a large number of mutations many of which occurred in the intronic regions. We also found 20 missense alterations located throughout the coding region of the gene ( Table III , Fig. 1A ). Although it is difficult to infer causality or even contribution to the tumor phenotype, we have analyzed these missense alterations and found that some of them are likely to impact protein function and therefore play a role in tumor progression ( Table III , Fig. 1A ). LGI1 variants We obtained sequencing information from 8 brain tumors samples and compared it with normal samples. We also screened 24 additional normal tissue DNAs. Normal samples revealed two recurring changes in the LGI1 gene: i) a silent mutation (g.34976T>C, c.881T>C and p.Phe219Phe) that has previously been reported (refSNP ID 1111820), found in 31 out of 32 samples and ii) a missense variant (g.39285T>C, c.1301T>C and p.Ile359Thr) that has not been reported, found in 8 out of 32 samples. It is unclear whether the latter variant may have any impact on protein function ( Table IV and Fig. 1B ). Additionally, brain tumor samples revealed 11 and 1 missense and nonsense tumor-specific mutations, respectively ( Tables I and IV ). Unfortunately, due to the limited number of orthologs, the known conservation analysis is not comprehensive. Importantly, a majority of the mutations (9/13) are located at the N-terminal region ( Fig. 1B ). Several of them (8/13) are located in defined domains that appear to be important for the function of LGI1 such as the leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and the cysteine clusters that flank the LRR, with one mutation targeting one of the conserved cysteines (C221W) ( Fig. 1B ).

Discussion In this study, we performed a sequence analysis of matched normal and tumor DNA derived from brain tumors in order to identify mutations in TP53 , RB1 and LGI1 . We chose to concentrate on these genes due to established, as is the case for TP53 and RB1 , or emerging, as is the case for LGI1 , roles in the development of brain tumors. TP53 and RB1 mutations are a common event in gliomas of all types ( 10 - 15 ). TP53 is mutated in 40-70% of grade II and III astrocytomas and 30-40% of GBMs ( 16 ) but less frequently in oligodendrogliomas (?5%) and mixed gliomas (?30%) ( 17 ). In a study of almost 200 astrocytomas of grades II-IV, 76% of GBMs, 72% of anaplastic astrocytomas and 67% of grade II astrocytomas were found to have a disruption in the TP53 pathway, while 67% of GBMs, 13% of anaplastic astrocytomas and 0% of grade II astrocytomas were found to have a disruption in the RB1 pathway ( 11 ). The critical role of TP53 in gliomagenesis has also been confirmed in numerous pre-clinical models ( 18 , 19 ). Mutations, allelic loss at 13q or homozygous deletion of RB1 is found in ?30% of GBMs and a smaller proportion of anaplastic astrocytomas ( 11 - 13 ). Our analysis identified 4 unique missense mutations in TP53 ( Table II ), all of which had previously been reported as somatic mutations in tumors ( http://www-p53.iarc.fr/ ). One such mutation, Arg273Cys, has also been found to mutate in the germline in 9 Li-Fraumeni syndrome families indicating that it is clearly an inactivating mutation. All mutations detected in TP53 are located in the DNA binding region, a region of the protein that is less tolerant to mutations ( 20 ). Accordingly, they are predicted to be deleterious by structure-based ( 21 ), AGVGD ( 22 ) and SIFT ( 23 ) prediction methods. Functional assays in yeast also indicate that all mutations are non-functional, with the one exception being Ala161Thr which is partially non-functional ( 20 ). We conclude that the TP53 mutations found in our study are ‘driver mutations’ and are likely to contribute to brain tumor progression. Twenty mutations were identified in RB1 ( Table III , Fig. 1A ), none of which had been reported to the Rb mutation database ( http://rb1-lsdb.d-lohmann.de/ ) or could be found in the literature. Since these mutations have yet to be characterized it is difficult to know whether they contribute to the tumor phenotype. Six variants are found in the N-terminal region, but there is no information regarding protein motifs in this region. The N-terminal mutations which are part of the three conserved N-terminal sub-domains (aa195-235, aa270-289 and aa317-343) ( 24 ) appear to be inconsequential as judged by their position and relative lack of conservation in other orthologs. Twelve mutations localize to the A and B domains many of which are in secondary structures and are likely to impact the RB1 function, although it is unknown to which extent ( Table III ). Finally, two mutations are found in the extreme C-terminus in relatively well-conserved residue positions, one of them in the cyclin/cdk docking site. Their impact on protein function is unclear. We conclude that although most mutations found in RB1 are likely to be ‘passengers’, some amino acid changes that may impact protein function are likely to contribute to the tumor phenotype. LGI1 has been implicated in the development of brain tumors, although it is still debated whether the evidence support a role as a bona fide tumor suppressor in brain tumors ( 6 , 25 - 27 ). Mutations in LGI1 cause autosomal-dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features ( 28 - 30 ). Herein, we report on 12 novel variants in LGI1 . Notably, the identified mutations differ from those that have been detected in patients with epilepsy ( Table IV , Fig. 1B ). Although it is difficult to infer causality or even contribution to the tumor phenotype we have analyzed these missense alterations and found that some of them are likely to impact protein function and therefore play a role in tumor progression ( Tables I - IV ). However, previous studies did not show mutations in LGI1 in glioblastomas, suggesting that they are not a common event ( 31 , 32 ). Further studies will be needed to determine the role of LGI1 in gliomagenesis.
