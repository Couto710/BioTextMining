ATM kinase is a master switch for the ?Np63? phosphorylation/degradation in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells upon DNA damage We previously found that the pro-apoptotic DNA damaging agent, cisplatin, mediated the proteasome-dependent degradation of ?Np63? associated with its increased phosphorylated status. Since ?Np63? usually plays an opposite role to p53 and TAp63 in human cancers, we tested the notion that phosphorylation events induced by DNA damage would affect the protein degradation of ?Np63? in HNSCC cells upon cisplatin exposure. We found that ?Np63? is phosphorylated in the time-dependent fashion at the following positions: S385, T397 and S466, which were surrounded by recognition motifs for ATM, CDK2 and p70s6K kinases, respectively. We showed that chemical agents or siRNA inhibiting the activity of ATM, CDK2 and p70s6K kinases blocked degradation of ?Np63? in HNSCC cells after cisplatin exposure. Site-specific mutagenesis of ?Np63? residues targeted for phosphorylation by ATM, CDK2 or p70s6k led to dramatic modulation of ?Np63? degradation. Finally, we demonstrated that the ?Np63? protein is a target for direct in vitro phosphorylation by ATM, CDK2 or p70s6K. Our results implicate specific kinases, and target phosphorylation sites in the degradation of ?Np63? following DNA damage.  Introduction Although p63 displays a similar modular structure and extensive homology to that of p53 , it encodes at least six different protein isotypes resulting from alternative splicing. 64 , 76 P63 isotypes consist of two groups, including those with the transactivation (TA)-domain at the amino terminus (TA-) or those without it (?N-). Similarly to p53, TAp63 isotypes bind specific DNA sequences activating transcription from p53-responsive genes that induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. 13 , 22 , 23 , 26 , 27 , 38 , 45 , 46 , 53 , 67 , 73 ?Np63? is the most abundant p63 isotype in proliferating basal layers of many epithelial tissues and is highly expressed in various human cancers (e.g., head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, HNSCC), supporting its role in cell proliferation and neoplastic development. 42 , 61 , 74 , 76 , 79 , 82 , 83 Since ?Np63 proteins retain the core DNA-binding domain, simple competition for DNA sites might prevent p53 or TAp63 from binding target gene promoters. 42 , 71 , 74 , 76 ?Np63? was also shown to play a more proactive role as a transcriptional regulator by activating or downregulating several critical downstream gene targets. 42 , 61 , 74 Moreover, ?Np63? was found to induce accumulation and signaling of ?-catenin supporting an oncogenic role for ?Np63 in HNSCC cells. 61 Previous studies showed that genotoxic stress agents including ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation, actinomycin D, bleomycin and etoposide led to accumulation of TAp63? and TAp63gamma proteins, and TAp63 proteins were degraded via a proteasome complex under normal cellular circumstances. 40 , 56 In addition, TAp63 was shown to activate p53-responsive genes involved in regulation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to UV-irradiation, or actinomycin D. 40 , 56 However, the effect of genotoxic stress on ?Np63 isotypes in most cancers, including head and neck cancers has not been well studied. A few reports showed that UV-irradiation decreased levels of ?Np63 in normal keratinocyte cultures. 46 , 79 , 80 Apoptosis is a common feature of the cytotoxicity caused by DNA damaging anti-cancer agents. 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 18 , 29 , 34 , 43 , 58 , 59 , 63 , 70 The overexpression of ?Np63? was shown to an increase in cell proliferation, and enhanced tumor growth in vitro and in vivo and also to block UV-induced p53-dependent apoptosis in vivo. 42 , 46 However, siRNA silencing of ?Np63? inhibited proliferation and mediated the programmed cell death of HNSCC cells supporting the notion that ?Np63? functions as an anti-apoptotic factor. 13 , 45 , 67 We previously found that cisplatin dramatically decreased the survival of HNSCC cells and also led to a proteasome-dependent degradation of ?Np63? 25 , 37 , 85 We further found that cisplatin exposure decreased protein levels of ?Np63? in HNSCC cells, while increasing overall phosphorylation levels of ?Np63? based on in vivo cell labeling and treatment with a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor. 25 , 37 This degradation of ?Np63? was also enhanced by the physical interaction of ?Np63? and stratifin, which preferentially binds to phosphorylated protein targets, such as ?Np63? 25 , 80 It is well known that p53 is phosphorylated upon DNA damage at the multiple sites, in both the N-termini and C-termini. 1 , 2 , 18 , 72 Although stress-related phosphorylation of the p53 tumor suppressor at the N-terminus leads to its stabilization, there are a few reports showing that p53 phosphorylation occurring at the C-terminus might lead to its subsequent degradation. 14 However, little is known about p63 phosphorylation events, especially after genotoxic stress. Since ?Np63? usually plays an opposite role in human cancers to p53 and TAp63, we hypothesized that this protein might react differently to DNA damage. In this scenario, the cisplatin-induced degradation of ?Np63? in HNSCC cells might occur through its phosphorylation rather than dephosphorylation. Earlier reports suggested that p63 is phosphorylated under unstressed conditions and after exposure of epithelial cells to cisplatin or UV-irradiation. 25 , 37 , 79 , 80 Therefore, we examined the type and consequences of phosphorylation events induced by DNA damage on ?Np63? levels in HNSCC cells after cisplatin exposure.  Experimental Procedures Cells, reagents and antibodies Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell line 029 (expressing wild type p53 and p63), and 028 (no p63 expression, while expressing wild type p53) were initially isolated from primary tissues and maintained at the Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. 32 Cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were incubated with cisplatin (10 ?g/ml, Sigma) and a 26S proteasome inhibitor (MG-132, 20 ?M, American Peptide Company). We also treated cells for 60 min with the cell-permeable inhibitors for ATM kinase, 5 ?M KU-55933 (2-Morpholin-4-yl-6-thianthren-1-yl-pyran-4-one (#118500, EMD Chemicals Inc.,), for CDK2, 20 ?M roscovitine 2-(R)-(1-ethyl-2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-isopropylpurine (EMD Chemicals), and for mTOR/p70s6K kinase, 20 nM rapamycin (EMD Chemicals). We used a rabbit polyclonal antibody Ab-1 directed against human ?Np63 (EMD Chemicals), a mouse monoclonal antibody against all human p63 isotypes (4A4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a monoclonal antibody against human ?-actin (Sigma), a mouse anti-human Cdk1/Cdk2 monoclonal antibody (clone AN21.2, ab6434, Abcam) and a rabbit anti-human s6K polyclonal antibody (ab36864, Abcam), a mouse anti-human ATM monoclonal antibody (clone 10H11.E12, ab36810, Abcam), a mouse anti-human p70s6k monoclonal antibody (clone 16, #611260, BD Biosciences/Pharmingen). Custom rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated peptides encompassing the ?Np63? protein sequences (ATM motif, NKLPSV-p S -QLINPQQ, residues 379-392; CDK2 motif, QQRNAL-p T -PTTIPDG, residues 391–404; p70s6K motif, LARLGC-p S -CLDYFT, residues 459–472) were prepared and purified against the phosphorylated peptide vs. non-phosphorylated peptide with the aid of Sigma Genosys. Ad-?Np63?-myc was prepared in our laboratory, as previously described. 61 The following recombinant proteins: ATM (#HZ-2029-10), Cdk2 (HZ-2018-10), p70s6K (HZ-2053-10) were purchased from Humanzyme, Inc., Recombinant GST-?Np63? was purified, as previously described. 25 About ~1.0–2.0 ?g of fusion protein was purified from 3–4 g of bacterial cells. To purify intact ?Np63?, GST-taq was cleaved by thrombin and separated by second round of glutathione-agarose column chromatography (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation Cells were lysed in buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Brij-50, 1 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM NaF, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 2X complete protease inhibitor cocktail), sonicated five times for 10 sec time intervals, and clarified for 30 min at 15,000 x g. 61 , 65 Supernatants (designated as total lysates) were resolved by 4–10% SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation, as previously described. 61 Generation of mutated p63 stable clones The stable HNSCC 029 clones expressing wild type and mutated ?Np63? were generated using the Flp-In technology (Invitrogen), as previously described. 37 Flp-In HNSCC 029 host cells were generated by stable insertion of pFRT/lacZeo plasmid and selected on Zeocin. 37 To establish the isogeneic HNSCC 029 clones expressing wild type and mutant ?Np63?, we subcloned the wild type or mutated cDNA for ?Np63? (prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick-Step mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following primers: ?Np63S385G_F (a1153g): 5?-CAAGCTGCCTTCTGTGGGCCAGCTTATCAACCC-3? ?Np63S385G_R: 5?-GGGTTGATAAGCTGGCCCACAGAAGGCAGCTTG-3?; ?Np63T397A_F (a1189g): 5?-CAGCGCAACGCCCTCGCTCCTACAACCATTCC-3? ?Np63T397A_R: 5?-GGAATGGTTGTAGGAGCGAGGGCGTTGCGCTG-3?; ?Np63S466A_F (t1396g): 5?-CGAGGTTGGGCTGTTCAGCATGTCTGGACTATTTC-3? ?Np63S466A_R, 5?-GAAATAGTCCAGACATGCTGAACAGCCCAACCTCG-3? and then confirmed by sequencing) into the pcDNA5/FRT/V5-His-TOPO vector. Flp-In HNSCC 029 cells were transfected with an empty pcDNA5/FRT/V5-His-T OPO vector or expression cassettes for ?Np63? (wild type or mutant) along with pOG44 plasmid, bearing the Flp recombinase. 37 Resulting Flp-In HNSCC 029 clones were selected on hygromycin B and verified by RT-PCR and sequencing. Flp-In 029 cells expressing wild type or mutated p63 grew and proliferate under unstressed conditions. The resulting cells were treated with 10 ?g/ml cisplatin in a time-dependent fashion. Small-interfering RNA (siRNA) We used the human ATM siRNA, CDK2 siRNA, p70s6K siRNA and validated negative control scrambled siRNA (SMARTpool, Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA). SiRNA were combined with DharmaFECT transfection reagent (Dharmacon), and the HNSCC 029 cells were transfected according to the recommended protocol with siRNA (100 nM final concentration). After 48 h of transfection, cells were starved in RPMI medium 1640 containing 0.5% FBS before treatment. After 48 h incubation, cells were treated with cisplatin for indicated time periods and then total cell lysates were used for immunoblotting analysis, as previously described. 25 , 37 Mass-spectrometry analysis of phosphorylation sites in ?Np63? 028 cells were infected with the recombinant Ad5-?Np63?-myc for 18 h (reviewed in refs. 25 , 61 , 82 and 83 ). Resulting cells were treated with 10 ?M cisplatin or with control medium for an additional 18 h, and ?Np63?-myc was immunoprecipitated overnight from cell lysates (500–2000 ?g) using the ProFound Mammalian C-myc Tag IP/Co-IP kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer’s protocol #2. The protein then was purified by fast-performance liquid chromatography allowing to achieve ~90% purity of ?Np63? and yielding ~10 ?g/108 cells. Purified ?Np63?-myc proteins from cells treated and untreated with cisplatin were subjected to the enzyme in-gel digestion, and the peptide mixture was subjected directly to peptide profiling by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) to pinpoint naturally occurring phosphopeptides, and to sequence and identify each peptide within the mixture. 3 , 9 , 19 , 36 , 49 , 68 , 86 MALDI-TOF-MS was performed using the Voyager DE ProTM mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Aliquots of digested peptides (1 pmol) in 1 ?l of H2O and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid were mixed with 1 ?l of cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, spotted onto a sample target, dried and loaded into the mass spectrometer. The MS-digest computer programs (MS-Fit, Protein Prospector, version 3.4.1. and ProFound, version 4.10.5) were provided by the Johns Hopkins University Mass Spectrometry Core and used to calculate the average masses of all possible peptide and phosphopeptide fragments of ?Np63?, and the m/z value of the mass spectral peaks for the corresponding MH+ ions. 8 , 28 The peptide masses were entered into the MASCOT Search Engine-2 and the National Center for Biotechnology Information database was searched to match the tryptic peptide fingerprint with a parent polypeptide. 49 , 62 In vitro protein kinase assay Kinase reactions contained 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, 5 ?Ci of [gamma32P]-ATP, 10 ?M cold ATP, 10 mM MnCl2, 0.25–0.5 ?g of PHAS-I (Stratagene), 2–4 ng of purified recombinant ATM (CDK2 or p70s6K or nothing, all purified kinases were purchased from Humanzyme) and 2–4 ng of purified ?Np63? as previously described. 11 , 25 The reactions were incubated at 30°C for 30 min. ?Np63? was precipitated with Ab-1 antibody, and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, dried and exposed to X-ray film with intensifying screen at 80°C.  Cells, reagents and antibodies Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell line 029 (expressing wild type p53 and p63), and 028 (no p63 expression, while expressing wild type p53) were initially isolated from primary tissues and maintained at the Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. 32 Cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were incubated with cisplatin (10 ?g/ml, Sigma) and a 26S proteasome inhibitor (MG-132, 20 ?M, American Peptide Company). We also treated cells for 60 min with the cell-permeable inhibitors for ATM kinase, 5 ?M KU-55933 (2-Morpholin-4-yl-6-thianthren-1-yl-pyran-4-one (#118500, EMD Chemicals Inc.,), for CDK2, 20 ?M roscovitine 2-(R)-(1-ethyl-2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-isopropylpurine (EMD Chemicals), and for mTOR/p70s6K kinase, 20 nM rapamycin (EMD Chemicals).

To further pursue these observations, we used HNSCC 028 cells (108) infected with Ad5-?Np63?-myc for 18 h and then treated with 10 ?M cisplatin or control medium for an additional 18 h. ?Np63?-myc was then immunoprecipitated overnight from cell lysates (500–2000 ?g) using the ProFound Mammalian C-myc Tag IP/Co-IP kit and purified by fast-performance liquid chromatography. The purified ?Np63?-myc was in-gel digested with chymotrypsin, and the peptide mixture was subjected directly to peptide profiling by MALDI-TOF-MS. Among a few phosphorylation sites in ?Np63? that were affected by cisplatin exposure ( Table 2 ), we found ATM, CDK2 and p70s6K kinase recognition motifs [S385, ATM motif, PSV S QL), T397, CDK2 motif, NAL T PTT), and S466, p70s6K, GCS S CLD]. To examine protein levels and phosphorylation levels of ?Np63? possibly affected by cisplatin exposure, we used HNSCC 028 cells (without endogenous p63 expression) ectopically expressing Ad5-?Np63?-myc, HaCaT immortalized keratinocytes (with endogenous p63 expression) and Flip-In HaCaT stable clones that expressed wild type or mutated ?Np63? (L514F mutation derived from Hay-Wells Syndrome), introduced into a genomic DNA (reviewed in ref. 37 ). Cells were treated with 10 ?M cisplatin or control media for 24 h. First, we examined levels of ?Np63? using immunoblotting with a custom antibody generated against the phosphorylated S385 (NKLPSVSQLINPQQ, residues 379–392, designated as the anti-pATM motif). We found evidence of an increased ?Np63? phosphorylation at the ATM motif upon exposure of HNSCC cells to cisplatin ( Fig. 1A and B ). We further used HNSCC 029 cells endogenously expressing an abundant amount of ?Np63? (reviewed in ref. 32 ) and treated the cells with 10 ?M cisplatin for 0, 12 and 24 h. Initially, we tested the effect of cisplatin exposure on cell survival using the MTT assay, as previously described. 32 Using both immunoblotting and combined immunoprecipitation/in vitro protein kinase assay, we also tested whether the protein and activity levels of ATM, CDK2 or p70s6K were affected upon exposure of HNSCC 029 cells to cisplatin. We observed that cisplatin exposure decreased the survival of HNSCC 029 cells (by 2-fold in 0–48 h time frame), associated with clear induction of protein levels, and most importantly enzymatic activity, of all the kinases tested (data not shown). To evaluate the effect of cisplatin on phosphorylation levels of ?Np63?, we employed immunoblotting of total lysates obtained from HNSCC 029 cells with custom antibodies against a phosphorylated ATM motif, CDK2 motif or p70s6K motif in the ?Np63? polypeptide. We found that phosphorylated protein levels at the indicated positions/motifs dramatically increased upon exposure of HNSCC 029 cells to cisplatin in a time-dependent fashion relative to total ?Np63? protein levels ( Fig. 2 ). Next, we grew HNSCC 029 cells in the presence or absence of 10 ?M cisplatin for 0, 6, 12 or 24 h and cell-permeable inhibitors for ATM (5 ?M KU-55933, reviewed in refs. 34 , 39 , 44 and 63 ), CDK2 (20 ?M roscovitine, reviewed in refs. 14 , 17 , 18 , 24 , 52 and 81 ) or p70s6K (20 nM rapamycin, reviewed in refs. 16 and 30 ) kinases (added for the last 60 min before cell harvesting). We first showed that these protein kinase inhibitors dramatically blocked the enzymatic activities of ATM, CDK2 and p70s6K, while increasing the cell survival compared to the inhibitory effect of cisplatin exposure (data not shown). Then, the protein levels for ?Np63? were tested by immunoblotting with Ab-1 antibody. We observed that all protein kinase inhibitors used in this set of experiments clearly blocked degradation of ?Np63? in HNSCC cells induced by cisplatin exposure ( Fig. 3 ). We then transiently introduced siRNA against ATM, CDK2 or p70s6K (300 nM each) into HNSCC 029 cells versus scrambled siRNA to examine their effectiveness in silencing expression of their respective target ( Fig. 4 ). We observed that siRNA dramatically silenced the expression of the protein kinases tested ( Fig. 4A ), and in turn decreased the cisplatin-induced degradation of ?Np63? in HNSCC 029 cells, while scrambled siRNA failed to do so ( Fig. 4B ). We further examined whether genetic changes in putative phosphorylation sites in the ?Np63? protein expressed in HNSCC 029 cells would affect its degradation upon cisplatin exposure. We established HNSCC 029 stable cell lines expressing the wild type ?Np63? or mutated ?Np63? (ATM phosphorylation site, CDK2 phosphorylation site and p70s6K phosphorylation site) using the Flp-In technology, as previously described. 37 This approach allowed us to introduce p63 mutations (S385, T397 and S466) into the genomic DNA of target 029 cells resembling a knock-in technique. The cells harboring p63 mutations exclusively expressed RNA transcripts with desired mutations, as confirmed by sequencing of individual clones derived from RT-PCR of mRNA obtained from mutated cells (data not shown). Interestingly, cells expressing mutated ?Np63? grew and proliferated at a similar rate to cells expressing the wild type ?Np63?, while protein and activity levels for ATM, CDK2 or p70s6K were the same (data not shown). These cells were then treated with 10 mM cisplatin and protein levels of ?Np63? were examined by immunoblotting with Ab-1 antibody against ?Np63. We observed that the absence of serine or threonine residues necessary for kinase phosphorylation [due to mutations in Ser (S385 or S466), or Thr (T397 for Ala] completely blocked the cisplatin-induced degradation of ?Np63? suggesting a critical role of all three of these residues in the phosphorylation-mediated degradation of ?Np63? in HNSCC cells ( Fig. 5 ). Next, we further explored whether the cisplatin exposure of HNSCC cells induced a possible sequence of events leading to phosphorylation of ?Np63?. Stable clones of HNSCC 029 cells harboring plasmids with wild type ?Np63? or ?Np63? mutated in the putative phosphorylation motifs (ATM, CDK2 or p70s6K) were grown up in the presence of 10 ?g/ml cisplatin for 0, 6, 12, 18, 24 h ( Fig. 6 ). Levels for phospho-?Np63? were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated custom antibodies against the pATM, pCDK2 or pp70s6k motifs, respectively ( Fig. 6 ). We found that in cells expressing the wild type ?Np63? cisplatin-inducedATM-mediated phosphorylation of ?Np63? started to reach maximal levels at ~6 h, while CDK2 phosphorylation occurred at 12 h and p70s6K phosphorylation at 18 h ( Fig. 6A ). We further observed that when testing cells with ATM-mutated phosphorylation site, neither of our custom antibodies recognized the phospho-?Np63? protein ( Fig. 6B ). Moreover, the antibody to the pATM-motif (in cells harboring mutated CDK2 site) or antibodies to pATM-motif or pCDK2 motif (in cells harboring mutated p70s6K site) recognized the phospho-?Np63? protein ( Fig. 6C and D ). Therefore, in HNSCC cells treated with cisplatin, the ?Np63? protein is phosphorylated first by ATM, then by CDK2 and finally by p70s6K kinases. Finally, we tested the ability of purified protein kinases (ATM, CDK2 or p70s6K) to phosphorylate the purified ?Np63? protein in vitro. 11 , 25 We showed that all tested kinases phosphorylated ?Np63? in vitro suggesting that ?Np63? is a direct target of these protein kinases ( Fig. 7 ).  Results To examine whether ?Np63?, the predominant p63 isotype in HNSCC cells (reviewed in refs. 42 , 60 , 61 and 65 ) is modified after exposure to cisplatin and to track down changes in the posttranslational modification status of ?Np63?, we employed a combination of immunoprecipitation with Ab-1 antibody against ?Np63 and subsequent 2D-gel separation of target proteins followed by mass spectrometry analysis. 25 , 37 We previously found that endogenous ?Np63? produced multiple modified p63 proteins in HaCaT cells shown by subsequent immunoprecipitation (with the Ab-1 antibody) and 2D-gel isolectrofocusing/SDS-electrophoresis. 37 This observation suggested that ?Np63? is phosphorylated and degraded in HNSCC cell lines exposed to genotoxic stress agents (cisplatin, UV) supporting our previous findings and those of other groups. 25 , 37 , 79 , 80 The initial bioinformatics searches performed by us ( www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhosK/ , see, Table 1 ) and others (reviewed in refs. 20 , 21 , 31 , 41 and 57 ) suggested that the ?Np63? protein might be phosphorylated at the multiple motifs by a variety of protein kinases (e.g., ATM, CDK, p70s6K, MAPK and protein C kinase).

We further used HNSCC 029 cells endogenously expressing an abundant amount of ?Np63? (reviewed in ref. 32 ) and treated the cells with 10 ?M cisplatin for 0, 12 and 24 h.

We first showed that these protein kinase inhibitors dramatically blocked the enzymatic activities of ATM, CDK2 and p70s6K, while increasing the cell survival compared to the inhibitory effect of cisplatin exposure (data not shown). Then, the protein levels for ?Np63? were tested by immunoblotting with Ab-1 antibody. We observed that all protein kinase inhibitors used in this set of experiments clearly blocked degradation of ?Np63? in HNSCC cells induced by cisplatin exposure ( Fig. 3 ).

We observed that siRNA dramatically silenced the expression of the protein kinases tested ( Fig. 4A ), and in turn decreased the cisplatin-induced degradation of ?Np63? in HNSCC 029 cells, while scrambled siRNA failed to do so ( Fig. 4B ). We further examined whether genetic changes in putative phosphorylation sites in the ?Np63? protein expressed in HNSCC 029 cells would affect its degradation upon cisplatin exposure. We established HNSCC 029 stable cell lines expressing the wild type ?Np63? or mutated ?Np63? (ATM phosphorylation site, CDK2 phosphorylation site and p70s6K phosphorylation site) using the Flp-In technology, as previously described. 37 This approach allowed us to introduce p63 mutations (S385, T397 and S466) into the genomic DNA of target 029 cells resembling a knock-in technique.

Next, we further explored whether the cisplatin exposure of HNSCC cells induced a possible sequence of events leading to phosphorylation of ?Np63?. Stable clones of HNSCC 029 cells harboring plasmids with wild type ?Np63? or ?Np63? mutated in the putative phosphorylation motifs (ATM, CDK2 or p70s6K) were grown up in the presence of 10 ?g/ml cisplatin for 0, 6, 12, 18, 24 h ( Fig. 6 ). Levels for phospho-?Np63? were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated custom antibodies against the pATM, pCDK2 or pp70s6k motifs, respectively ( Fig. 6 ). We found that in cells expressing the wild type ?Np63? cisplatin-inducedATM-mediated phosphorylation of ?Np63? started to reach maximal levels at ~6 h, while CDK2 phosphorylation occurred at 12 h and p70s6K phosphorylation at 18 h ( Fig. 6A ). We further observed that when testing cells with ATM-mutated phosphorylation site, neither of our custom antibodies recognized the phospho-?Np63? protein ( Fig. 6B ). Moreover, the antibody to the pATM-motif (in cells harboring mutated CDK2 site) or antibodies to pATM-motif or pCDK2 motif (in cells harboring mutated p70s6K site) recognized the phospho-?Np63? protein ( Fig. 6C and D ). Therefore, in HNSCC cells treated with cisplatin, the ?Np63? protein is phosphorylated first by ATM, then by CDK2 and finally by p70s6K kinases. Finally, we tested the ability of purified protein kinases (ATM, CDK2 or p70s6K) to phosphorylate the purified ?Np63? protein in vitro. 11 , 25 We showed that all tested kinases phosphorylated ?Np63? in vitro suggesting that ?Np63? is a direct target of these protein kinases ( Fig. 7 ).  Discussion We previously found that genotoxic stress agents (e.g., cisplatin, doxorubicin, etc.,) induced phosphorylation of ?Np63? leading to a dramatic decrease of the ?Np63? protein levels in HNSCC cells. 25 , 85 By using MALDI-TOF-MS, we have identified phosphorylated sites in ?Np63? in HNSCC cells upon cisplatin exposure. They included the S385, T397 and S466 sites surrounded by recognition motifs for the ATM, CDK2 and p70s6K kinases, respectively. We also showed that the cisplatin-exposed HNSCC cells harbored phosphorylated ?Np63? at the ATM, CDK2 and p70s6K kinase recognition sites in a time-dependent fashion. We further showed that chemicals or siRNA inhibiting the activity of ATM, CDK2 and p70s6K kinases blocked degradation of ?Np63? in HNSCC cells usually induced upon cisplatin exposure. We also found that engineered genetic changes in ?Np63? that replace specific residues targeted for phosphorylation by ATM, CDK2 or p70s6k led to a dramatic modulation of ?Np63? degradation. We also showed that the ?Np63? protein in HNSCC cells exposed to cisplatin is probably phosphorylated first by ATM, then by CDK2 and finally by p70s6K kinases ultimately targeting ?Np63? to a proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. 12 , 25 Finally, we demonstrated that the ?Np63? protein is a target for direct in vitro phosphorylation by ATM, CDK2 or p70s6K. Overall, we suggest that ATM kinase is a master switch for the ?Np63? phosphorylation/degradation in human HNSCC cells upon DNA damage. Accumulating evidence points to a role for multiple posttranslational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation) in response of cells to DNA damage induced by various extracellular stimuli mediating these events. 1 , 2 , 6 , 7 , 20 , 21 , 27 , 43 , 50 , 72 Recent studies suggest that N-terminal phosphorylations are important for stabilizing p53 in cells exposed to genotoxic stresses. 6 However, the modifications to the C-terminus of p53 inhibit its ability to negatively regulate sequence-specific DNA-binding, and also modulate protein stability, the oligomerization state, the nuclear import/export process, and the degree of p53 ubiquitination. 14 From other hand, ?Np63 isotypes were shown to manifest cellular response to DNA damage in an opposite fashion via protein degradation, because they lack the N-terminal region of TA-isotypes found in all p53 family members. 25 Keeping this in mind, we now have evidence that cisplatin-induced degradation of ?Np63? in HNSCC cells occurs after its phosphorylation at specific sites. Since ?Np63? usually plays an opposite role in human cancers compared to p53 and TAp63, we now add additional molecular evidence that this protein reacts differently to cisplatin ands possibly to other DNA damaging agents. Although both exogenous ?Np63? protein expressed in transfected cells under unstressed conditions (reviewed in ref. 79 ) and endogenous ?Np63? expressed in human keratinocytes and HNSCC cells under stressed conditions 25 , 37 , 80 were reported to be phosphorylated, a comprehensive and direct analysis of the p63 sites phosphorylated by specific kinases was not previously performed. The relationship between p63 and key protein kinases is mutually intertwined. A few protein kinases were found to be involved in the upstream regulation of p63 transcription and several other protein kinases were shown to be p63 downstream transcription targets. 5 , 48 , 54 , 64 , 78 , 82 Westfall and coworkers have shown that certain amino acid residues are phosphorylated in ?Np63? in human keratinocytes upon UV-irradiation. 79 , 80 All the modified species of ?Np63? (12—in UV-treated cells, and 7—in untreated cells) were reduced to one by treatment of ?Np63? precipitates with calf intestine phosphatase supporting the notion that ?Np63? is indeed a phosphoprotein. 79 , 80 Using antibodies to certain phosphorylated residues of ?Np63?, Westfall and coworkers have also found an increase in phosphorylation of S66/S68 and S361 in ?Np63? upon paclitaxel or UV exposure. 80 The latter was also shown to induce the rapid phosphorylation of ?Np63? by the p38 stress MAPK leading to inhibition of ?Np63? transcriptional activity and its degradation. 35 , 59 Phosphorylated ?Np63 displayed a decreased ability to bind certain cell cycle arrest and apoptotic promoters, thus allowing rapid activation of the p53-dependent transcriptional apoptotic program. 59 Interestingly, the Abl inhibitor, Gleevec was shown to reduce TAp63 expression in a dose-dependent manner in HNSCC cells thereby overriding its induction by DNA damaging agents. 58 , 77 Since p63 proteins share a strong homology with p53, it is likely that many protein kinases implicated in phosphorylation of p53 might play a similar role in p63 (reviewed in refs. 20 and 21 ). Using a bioinformatics approach (GPS kinase prediction module), Finlan and Hupp uncovered several putative protein kinase motifs (Abl, PKB, ATM, S6K, CDK, MAPK and EGFR) for potential TAp63? phosphorylation ( Fig. 8A and reviewed in ref. 21 ). A fewer motifs were predicted in the protein sequence of ?Np63? that lacks the N-terminal domain ( Fig. 8B ). Multiple signaling pathways exist to stabilize p53 in response to different forms of stress through phosphorylation of p53 by a variety of protein kinases. 1 , 6 , 20 , 50 They include the following kinases serving as DNA damage checkpoints and sensor proteins: ATM, ATR, AURKA, DNA-PK, CHK1 and 2, CDK2 and 5, HIPK2, PKC, PKR, FACT-CK2, ERK, p38 stress MAPK, JNK, GSK3?, etc. 1 , 6 It is not surprising that at least two of these kinases (ATM and CDK2) shown in the current study play a role in modification of ?Np63? after DNA damage induced by cisplatin exposure. Mammalian cells respond to DNA damage by activating signal transduction pathways that arrest cell cycle progression and initiate DNA repair. 1 , 27 , 29 , 50 , 55 A key regulator of the cell response to DNA damage is the ATM protein kinase, whose activation/homodimerization leads to association of ATM with its protein targets and their phosphorylation with subsequent effects on cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis and DNA repair. 1 , 43 , 50 , 55 Abnormal regulation of progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle by altered activity of CDKs was shown to be a hallmark of cancer. 18 , 55 , 87 There is also evidence implicating the mTOR/p70s6K signaling pathway in regulating cell proliferation and the resistance of cancer cells to cisplatin. 47 , 77 , 84 Our study shows that the above-mentioned protein kinases phosphorylate ?Np63? in HNSCC cells upon cisplatin exposure. Additional studies are necessary to perform a comprehensive mapping of phosphorylation events and protein kinases involved in the regulation of p63 in a variety of cell types. Moreover, it is still unclear how phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation events affect the transcriptional function of p63. As in the case of p53 posttranslational modifications, these modifications are likely to play a critical role in regulating p63 function as a transcriptional regulator of tumorigenesis, cell proliferation/differentiation or DNA replication stress. 28 , 55 Since ?Np63 isotypes play an opposite role towards p53, we suggest that the long-term DNA damage induces a dramatic decrease of the ?Np63? protein levels decrease leading to an increase in the ability of the wild type p53 to function as tumor suppressor, thereby modulating cell proliferation (by cell cycle arrest or apoptosis) and directing cells to senesce. 85  Discussion We previously found that genotoxic stress agents (e.g., cisplatin, doxorubicin, etc.,) induced phosphorylation of ?Np63? leading to a dramatic decrease of the ?Np63? protein levels in HNSCC cells. 25 , 85 By using MALDI-TOF-MS, we have identified phosphorylated sites in ?Np63? in HNSCC cells upon cisplatin exposure. They included the S385, T397 and S466 sites surrounded by recognition motifs for the ATM, CDK2 and p70s6K kinases, respectively. We also showed that the cisplatin-exposed HNSCC cells harbored phosphorylated ?Np63? at the ATM, CDK2 and p70s6K kinase recognition sites in a time-dependent fashion.

Overall, we suggest that ATM kinase is a master switch for the ?Np63? phosphorylation/degradation in human HNSCC cells upon DNA damage. Accumulating evidence points to a role for multiple posttranslational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation) in response of cells to DNA damage induced by various extracellular stimuli mediating these events. 1 , 2 , 6 , 7 , 20 , 21 , 27 , 43 , 50 , 72 Recent studies suggest that N-terminal phosphorylations are important for stabilizing p53 in cells exposed to genotoxic stresses. 6 However, the modifications to the C-terminus of p53 inhibit its ability to negatively regulate sequence-specific DNA-binding, and also modulate protein stability, the oligomerization state, the nuclear import/export process, and the degree of p53 ubiquitination. 14 From other hand, ?Np63 isotypes were shown to manifest cellular response to DNA damage in an opposite fashion via protein degradation, because they lack the N-terminal region of TA-isotypes found in all p53 family members. 25 Keeping this in mind, we now have evidence that cisplatin-induced degradation of ?Np63? in HNSCC cells occurs after its phosphorylation at specific sites. Since ?Np63? usually plays an opposite role in human cancers compared to p53 and TAp63, we now add additional molecular evidence that this protein reacts differently to cisplatin ands possibly to other DNA damaging agents. Although both exogenous ?Np63? protein expressed in transfected cells under unstressed conditions (reviewed in ref. 79 ) and endogenous ?Np63? expressed in human keratinocytes and HNSCC cells under stressed conditions 25 , 37 , 80 were reported to be phosphorylated, a comprehensive and direct analysis of the p63 sites phosphorylated by specific kinases was not previously performed. The relationship between p63 and key protein kinases is mutually intertwined. A few protein kinases were found to be involved in the upstream regulation of p63 transcription and several other protein kinases were shown to be p63 downstream transcription targets. 5 , 48 , 54 , 64 , 78 , 82 Westfall and coworkers have shown that certain amino acid residues are phosphorylated in ?Np63? in human keratinocytes upon UV-irradiation. 79 , 80 All the modified species of ?Np63? (12—in UV-treated cells, and 7—in untreated cells) were reduced to one by treatment of ?Np63? precipitates with calf intestine phosphatase supporting the notion that ?Np63? is indeed a phosphoprotein. 79 , 80 Using antibodies to certain phosphorylated residues of ?Np63?, Westfall and coworkers have also found an increase in phosphorylation of S66/S68 and S361 in ?Np63? upon paclitaxel or UV exposure. 80 The latter was also shown to induce the rapid phosphorylation of ?Np63? by the p38 stress MAPK leading to inhibition of ?Np63? transcriptional activity and its degradation. 35 , 59 Phosphorylated ?Np63 displayed a decreased ability to bind certain cell cycle arrest and apoptotic promoters, thus allowing rapid activation of the p53-dependent transcriptional apoptotic program. 59 Interestingly, the Abl inhibitor, Gleevec was shown to reduce TAp63 expression in a dose-dependent manner in HNSCC cells thereby overriding its induction by DNA damaging agents. 58 , 77 Since p63 proteins share a strong homology with p53, it is likely that many protein kinases implicated in phosphorylation of p53 might play a similar role in p63 (reviewed in refs. 20 and 21 ). Using a bioinformatics approach (GPS kinase prediction module), Finlan and Hupp uncovered several putative protein kinase motifs (Abl, PKB, ATM, S6K, CDK, MAPK and EGFR) for potential TAp63? phosphorylation ( Fig. 8A and reviewed in ref. 21 ). A fewer motifs were predicted in the protein sequence of ?Np63? that lacks the N-terminal domain ( Fig. 8B ). Multiple signaling pathways exist to stabilize p53 in response to different forms of stress through phosphorylation of p53 by a variety of protein kinases. 1 , 6 , 20 , 50 They include the following kinases serving as DNA damage checkpoints and sensor proteins: ATM, ATR, AURKA, DNA-PK, CHK1 and 2, CDK2 and 5, HIPK2, PKC, PKR, FACT-CK2, ERK, p38 stress MAPK, JNK, GSK3?, etc. 1 , 6 It is not surprising that at least two of these kinases (ATM and CDK2) shown in the current study play a role in modification of ?Np63? after DNA damage induced by cisplatin exposure. Mammalian cells respond to DNA damage by activating signal transduction pathways that arrest cell cycle progression and initiate DNA repair. 1 , 27 , 29 , 50 , 55 A key regulator of the cell response to DNA damage is the ATM protein kinase, whose activation/homodimerization leads to association of ATM with its protein targets and their phosphorylation with subsequent effects on cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis and DNA repair. 1 , 43 , 50 , 55 Abnormal regulation of progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle by altered activity of CDKs was shown to be a hallmark of cancer. 18 , 55 , 87 There is also evidence implicating the mTOR/p70s6K signaling pathway in regulating cell proliferation and the resistance of cancer cells to cisplatin. 47 , 77 , 84 Our study shows that the above-mentioned protein kinases phosphorylate ?Np63? in HNSCC cells upon cisplatin exposure. Additional studies are necessary to perform a comprehensive mapping of phosphorylation events and protein kinases involved in the regulation of p63 in a variety of cell types. Moreover, it is still unclear how phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation events affect the transcriptional function of p63. As in the case of p53 posttranslational modifications, these modifications are likely to play a critical role in regulating p63 function as a transcriptional regulator of tumorigenesis, cell proliferation/differentiation or DNA replication stress. 28 , 55 Since ?Np63 isotypes play an opposite role towards p53, we suggest that the long-term DNA damage induces a dramatic decrease of the ?Np63? protein levels decrease leading to an increase in the ability of the wild type p53 to function as tumor suppressor, thereby modulating cell proliferation (by cell cycle arrest or apoptosis) and directing cells to senesce. 85
