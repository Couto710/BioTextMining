Palettes of Vaccines and Immunostimulatory Monoclonal Antibodies for Combination Various monoclonal antibodies (mAb) target immune system molecules to enhance immunity by costimulating T cells (i.e., CD137, OX40, CD40, GITR) or interfering in coinhibitory signals (i.e., CTLA-4, PD-1). These powerful agents can be guided by cancer vaccines to enhance immunity against tumor but not self tissues. Clinically powerful therapeutic synergies are at hand.
