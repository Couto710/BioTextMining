Combined Hyperspectral and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Microscope for Non-invasive Hemodynamic Imaging We have combined hyperspectral imaging with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) to non-invasively image changes in hemoglobin saturation, blood flow, microvessel morphology and sheer rate on the vessel wall with tumor growth. Changes in these hemodynamic variables were measured over 24 hours in dorsal skin fold window chamber tumors. There was a strong correlation between volumetric flow and hemoglobin saturation (? = 0.89, p = 9 Ã— 10?6, N = 15), and a moderate correlation between shear rate on the vessel wall and hemoglobin saturation (? = 0.56, p = 0.03, N=15).
