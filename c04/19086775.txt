Contingency Management is Efficacious for Cocaine Abusers with Prior Treatment Attempts Contingency management (CM) is an efficacious treatment of substance use disorders (SUD), and efforts are underway to detect subgroups who may be more or less responsive to CM. A history of prior SUD treatment attempts is associated with greater substance use severity and poor treatment outcomes. This study examined the impact of prior treatment attempts on treatment retention, longest duration of continuous abstinence (LDA), proportion of negative samples submitted, and posttreatment abstinence in a combined sample of cocaine abusers randomized to standard care SUD outpatient treatment (SC) or SC plus CM from 3 published trials. Participants ( N = 393) were categorized according to self-reported prior treatment attempts (0–1 prior attempts, ? 2 prior attempts). Participants with multiple prior treatment attempts were older, had more severe alcohol and cocaine use disorders, and had greater employment-related problems. Participants with 0–1 prior treatment attempts had comparable treatment retention, regardless of treatment condition; however, among participants with multiple prior treatment attempts, retention was greater for CM than SC. A similar, but nonsignificant ( p = .08) pattern was evident for LDA in which LDA was longer for individuals in CM compared to SC, and this effect was more pronounced for individuals with multiple prior treatment attempts. LDA was a significant predictor of negative (for cocaine, alcohol, and opiates) specimen results at Month 9. The results provide support for CM as an advantageous option for individuals with multiple prior treatment attempts, as well as for substance abuse treatment patients in general.  Baseline Characteristics Table 2 presents descriptive data by prior treatment attempt categories. The groups were not equally distributed by study, ?2 (2) = 27.12, p < .001, with an under-representation of participants with 0–1 prior treatment attempts in the Petry et al. (2005a) study. Individuals with ? 2 prior treatment attempts were significantly older, were significantly less likely to be employed, had higher rates of alcohol dependence and cocaine dependence, and reported more years of alcohol use and more years of cocaine use than individuals with 0–1 prior treatment attempts. Participants with multiple prior treatment attempts evidenced significantly greater alcohol- and employment-related problems, but were otherwise similar to those with 0–1 prior treatments on baseline ASI variables.  Prior Treatment Attempts and Primary Treatment Outcomes Table 3 presents primary treatment outcomes by prior treatment status and treatment condition. While controlling for age ( p = .07), years of cocaine use ( p = .88), and study ( p = .11), no main effect of prior treatment attempts was present for the number of weeks retained in treatment, F (1, 384) = 0.48, p = .49, ?p2 = 0.001. Compared to SC, CM was associated with longer treatment retention, F (1, 384) = 6.27, p = .01, ?p2 = 0.016. A significant prior treatment status by treatment condition interaction was also present, F (1, 384) = 4.46, p = .04, ?p2 = 0.011. For individuals with 0–1 prior treatment attempts, treatment retention was comparable for both treatment conditions (Cohen’s d = 0.10); however, among individuals with multiple prior treatment attempts, CM was associated with improved treatment retention (Cohen’s d = 0.60). Results for LDA were similar. While controlling for age (p = .28), years of cocaine use (p = .32), and study ( p < .001), no differences in LDA were present between individuals with 0–1 versus multiple prior treatment attempts, F (1, 384) = 0.56, p = .45, ?p2 = 0.001. Compared to SC, CM was associated with longer durations of continuous abstinence, F (1, 384) = 10.30, p = .001, ?p2 = 0.026. A trend was present for the prior treatment attempts by treatment condition interaction for LDA, F (1, 384) = 3.12, p = .08, ?p2 = 0.008. For individuals with 0–1 prior treatments, LDA was 1 week longer for CM compared to SC (CM = 4.19 versus SC = 3.25 weeks; Cohen’s d = 0.26). However, among those with multiple prior treatment episodes the effect of CM on LDA (CM = 6.12 versus SC = 4.19 weeks; Cohen’s d = 0.67) was numerically larger compared to the increase observed for participants with 0–1 prior treatments. For the proportion of negative samples submitted, no significant main effects of prior treatment attempts, F (1, 384) = 0.87, p = .35, ?p2 = 0.002, or treatment condition, F (1, 384) = 0.24, p = .63, ?p2 = 0.001, were present while controlling for age ( p = .55), years of cocaine use ( p = .28), and study ( p < .001). The treatment attempts by treatment condition interaction was not significant, F (1, 384) = 2.48, p = .12, ?p2 = 0.006.  Prior Treatment Attempts and 9 Month Posttreatment Outcomes Table 3 presents the unadjusted percentages of negative samples submitted at Month 9 by prior treatment attempts and treatment condition for the available data and when all missing samples were coded as positive samples. We describe the results of the logistic regression predicting abstinence at Month 9 using the available data here, but note that either approach yielded similar results. Step 1 (age, years of cocaine use, study, treatment condition, prior treatment status, and prior treatment status by treatment condition interaction) of the logistic regression was statistically significant, ?2(7, n = 244) = 16.23, p = .023. The addition of Step 2 (mean-centered LDA and the mean-centered LDA by prior treatment status interaction) improved the model, ?2(2, n = 244) = 31.01, p < .001, and yielded acceptable model fit, Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit ?2(8) = 4.63, p = .80. Classification accuracy for the overall model was 79%. Significant predictors included years of cocaine use and the centered LDA variable. For each additional year of cocaine use, odds of submitting a negative specimen at the Month 9 follow-up decreased by 5%, 95% Odds Ratio Confidence Interval: 0.908–0.995. LDA was positively associated with negative urine/breath sample results at Month 9. For every 1 week increase in LDA, odds of submitting a negative specimen increased by 21%, 95% Odds Ratio Confidence Interval: 1.10–1.33. Prior treatment attempt status was not associated with Month 9 specimen results using available data as a main effect, nor as an interaction with treatment condition or with LDA (all p ’s > .05).  Method Participants The overall sample consisted of 393 treatment-seeking cocaine abusers who participated in one of three randomized clinical trials conducted at four community SUD treatment clinics between 1998 and 2004 ( Petry et al., 2004 ; Petry, Alessi, Marx, Austin, & Tardiff, 2005 ; Petry et al., 2006 ). Age, education level, years of cocaine use, and treatment history were comparable across clinics (all p ’s > .05). All studies were similar in the targeted population, treatment intensity and duration, follow-up structure, assessment and outcomes measures, procedures, and clinic setting. Eligibility was established at initiation of intensive outpatient SUD treatment services, and presence of past year cocaine abuse or dependence per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994 ). All participants were 18 years of age or older. Exclusion criteria included medically uncontrolled mania or psychosis, an inability to understand study procedures, active suicidal ideation, and in recovery for pathological gambling. Research assistants approached 482 clinic patients, of whom 433 consented. After exclusions [unmet study criteria ( n = 26), refusal to participate ( n = 25), failure to return to clinic or incomplete evaluation ( n = 38)], 393 participants remained and were randomized to SC or CM. Procedure Data collection procedures were consistent across studies and clinics. Demographic data were collected during an initial 2-hour interview, which included administration of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI; McLellan et al., 1985 ) and modules (substance use disorder and pathological gambling) of the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID-I; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 1996 ). The number of self-reported lifetime prior alcohol and drug treatment attempts (not limited to the primary drug, but exclusive of 12-Step participation) was gathered from the ASI at study intake. Detoxification attempts not followed by a traditional substance abuse treatment program were not included in this calculation. For the entire sample, the number of prior treatment attempts varied widely (Range = 0–210, IQR = 2–8). The variable was highly skewed ( M = 9, Mdn. = 4, Mode = 2). However, this was not the result of a few extreme outliers, and more than 10% of the sample reported 20 or more prior treatment attempts. With the highly skewed nature of the variable in mind, we examined the distribution of the prior treatment variables and explored possible thresholds to dichotomize participants, specifically, 0 versus 1+ and 0–1 versus 2+. The first threshold was rejected due to a limited number of participants (13%) reporting no prior treatment attempts. The modal value of 2 prior treatments provided a natural threshold, and categories represented individuals with 0–1 prior treatment attempts ( n = 87) and ? 2 prior treatment attempts ( n = 306). Among individuals with multiple prior treatment attempts, the median number of prior treatment attempts was 5 (IQR = 3.0–11.0). Breath samples were screened for alcohol (Alco-sensor IV Alcometer; Intoximetrics, St. Louis, MO) and urine samples were screened for opioids and cocaine (OnTrak TesTstiks; Varian Inc., Walnut Creek, CA) at intake and throughout the study intervention. The specimen sample collection schedule was identical across all studies and conditions; however, the total number of sample submitted during treatment differed by treatment condition, (SC: M = 9.25, SD = 5.30; CM: M = 11.90, SD = 6.00), F (1, 391) = 16.91, p < .001, and study ( Petry et al., 2004 : M = 9.34, SD = 6.09; Petry et al., 2005a : M = 12.66, SD = 5.83; Petry et al., 2006 : M = 11.09, SD = 5.43), F (2, 390) = 10.73, p < .001. Thus, we present data with respect to proportion of negative samples out of total samples submitted, calculated for 100% of the sample. Sample submission rates were comparable across treatment attempt groups (0–1 attempts: M = 10.33, SD = 5.88; ? 2 attempts: M = 11.35, SD = 5.93), t (391) = ?1.41, p = .16. Participants provided additional urine and breath samples at the months 1, 3, 6, and 9 following treatment initiation and received payments of $15–$35 for completing these evaluations. Self-report measures were also collected at these follow-ups. For the present paper, we focus on data from the most distal follow-up, Month 9. Completion rates for the Month 9 follow-up were 69%, with no differences in the number of completed follow-up evaluations across prior treatment status, treatment conditions, or studies (all p ’s > .05). The university’s Institutional Review Board approved all study procedures, and all subjects provided written informed consent. Treatments Following the intake interview, participants in all three trials were randomized into SC or one of two CM conditions. The SC treatments were similar in intensity, structure, and therapeutic orientation across studies and clinics. CM conditions are briefly described below. Additional details on the CM procedures are available from the primary papers ( Petry et al., 2004 ; 2005a ; 2006 ). Standard Care SC consisted of group therapy sessions involving psychoeducation, skills-based instruction, and 12-step treatment in an intensive-outpatient SUD treatment format. Treatment intensity and frequency were structured according to the needs of the client (up to 5 hours per day, 3–5 days per week), and gradually reduced over time. Participants were expected to attend one aftercare group session per week for up to 12 months. Up to 21 sets of breath/urine samples were collected and screened during the 12-week study intervention period. Samples were collected 3 days per week during weeks 1–3, 2 day per week during weeks 4–6, and 1 day per week during weeks 7–12. All study data (including breath/urine sample results) were considered confidential and were not shared with clinic staff; however, participants with positive samples were encouraged to discuss their substance use with counselors. CM Treatment CM participants received the same SC described above. In addition, participants received reinforcement for verified abstinence and/or goal-related activity completion. The six CM conditions (2 CM conditions per study) differed in the magnitude of available reinforcement for each target behavior (range = $80–$874), reinforcement delivery system (prizes or vouchers), and target behaviors (abstinence and/or goal-related activities; see Table 1 ). Reinforcement for abstinence was provided when breath/urine samples were negative for alcohol, cocaine, and opioids. Reinforcement for activities was provided when participants submitted verification that up to 3 activities previously agreed upon with research staff were completed each week (see Petry, Tedford, & Martin, 2001 ).  Participants The overall sample consisted of 393 treatment-seeking cocaine abusers who participated in one of three randomized clinical trials conducted at four community SUD treatment clinics between 1998 and 2004 ( Petry et al., 2004 ; Petry, Alessi, Marx, Austin, & Tardiff, 2005 ; Petry et al., 2006 ).

Reinforcement for abstinence was provided when breath/urine samples were negative for alcohol, cocaine, and opioids. Reinforcement for activities was provided when participants submitted verification that up to 3 activities previously agreed upon with research staff were completed each week (see Petry, Tedford, & Martin, 2001 ).  Data Analytic Procedure We compared individuals with multiple versus 0–1 treatment attempts for differences in baseline and substance use characteristics using t- tests and Chi-square tests. Nonnormal variables were analyzed using nonparametric tests and similar results were obtained; however, we chose to report the parametric procedures given the robust nature of t- tests to normality violations when sample sizes are large ( Lumley, Diehr, Emerson, & Chen, 2002 ). Corrected t -values and degrees of freedom are reported when heterogeneous variances were present. Primary treatment outcome variables (available for 100% of participants) were treatment retention (range = 0–12 weeks), longest duration of objectively-verified continuous abstinence achieved (LDA; range = 0–12 weeks), and proportion of negative samples submitted (out of total number of submitted samples by each participant). LDA was defined as the greatest number of consecutive weeks in which all samples submitted in a given week were negative for alcohol, cocaine, and opioids. Unexcused absences, missed, or positive samples (for one or more drugs) interrupted the sequence of abstinence. Heterogeneous variances across groups were present for the primary treatment outcomes, and although analyses using untransformed variables are reported, analyses were completed using transformed variables (to stabilize variances) with comparable results. The relation between prior treatment attempts and primary treatment outcomes was examined using separate univariate analyses of covariance (ANCOVA’s) due to high correlation between the dependent variables. For the ANCOVA’s, prior treatment attempts (0–1 episodes, ? 2 episodes) and treatment condition (SC, CM) were entered as independent variables. Baseline variables differing significantly between groups and those known to be associated with substance abuse treatment outcomes were examined as potential covariates. Variables were excluded as covariates if no association with the dependent variables was present, resulting in the exclusion of several variables that differed significantly between groups, including employment status, cocaine and alcohol dependence diagnoses, years of alcohol use, ASI employment scores, and ASI alcohol scores. As recommended by Tabachnick and Fidell (2001) , we also excluded potential covariate variables that were strongly correlated with one another, and breath/urine specimen results (positive/negative) collected at study intake was highly correlated with study. Thus, age, years of cocaine use, and study were covariates included in all multivariate analyses. Two multivariate outliers were excluded from the primary treatment outcome analyses. Logistic regression examined predictors of posttreatment abstinence using Month 9 urine/breath specimen results (negative for alcohol, cocaine, and opioids) as the dependent variable. Covariates (age, years of cocaine use, and study), prior treatment attempts status, treatment condition, and the prior treatment attempts status by treatment condition interaction were entered into the equation at Step 1. Based on prior findings suggesting LDA is a reliable predictor of later abstinence ( Higgins, Badger, & Budney, 2000 ; Petry et al., 2005a ), we entered the LDA variable (mean-centered to reduce multicollinearity) and the mean-centered LDA by prior treatment attempts status interaction at Step 2. We conducted the logistic regression twice, first using the available data ( n = 244), and second with all missing samples coded as positive specimens ( N = 393). One case (standardized residual > 3.29) was excluded from the missing coded positive analysis. Analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows (v.15).  Results Baseline Characteristics Table 2 presents descriptive data by prior treatment attempt categories. The groups were not equally distributed by study, ?2 (2) = 27.12, p < .001, with an under-representation of participants with 0–1 prior treatment attempts in the Petry et al. (2005a) study. Individuals with ? 2 prior treatment attempts were significantly older, were significantly less likely to be employed, had higher rates of alcohol dependence and cocaine dependence, and reported more years of alcohol use and more years of cocaine use than individuals with 0–1 prior treatment attempts. Participants with multiple prior treatment attempts evidenced significantly greater alcohol- and employment-related problems, but were otherwise similar to those with 0–1 prior treatments on baseline ASI variables. Prior Treatment Attempts and Primary Treatment Outcomes Table 3 presents primary treatment outcomes by prior treatment status and treatment condition. While controlling for age ( p = .07), years of cocaine use ( p = .88), and study ( p = .11), no main effect of prior treatment attempts was present for the number of weeks retained in treatment, F (1, 384) = 0.48, p = .49, ?p2 = 0.001. Compared to SC, CM was associated with longer treatment retention, F (1, 384) = 6.27, p = .01, ?p2 = 0.016. A significant prior treatment status by treatment condition interaction was also present, F (1, 384) = 4.46, p = .04, ?p2 = 0.011. For individuals with 0–1 prior treatment attempts, treatment retention was comparable for both treatment conditions (Cohen’s d = 0.10); however, among individuals with multiple prior treatment attempts, CM was associated with improved treatment retention (Cohen’s d = 0.60). Results for LDA were similar. While controlling for age (p = .28), years of cocaine use (p = .32), and study ( p < .001), no differences in LDA were present between individuals with 0–1 versus multiple prior treatment attempts, F (1, 384) = 0.56, p = .45, ?p2 = 0.001. Compared to SC, CM was associated with longer durations of continuous abstinence, F (1, 384) = 10.30, p = .001, ?p2 = 0.026. A trend was present for the prior treatment attempts by treatment condition interaction for LDA, F (1, 384) = 3.12, p = .08, ?p2 = 0.008. For individuals with 0–1 prior treatments, LDA was 1 week longer for CM compared to SC (CM = 4.19 versus SC = 3.25 weeks; Cohen’s d = 0.26). However, among those with multiple prior treatment episodes the effect of CM on LDA (CM = 6.12 versus SC = 4.19 weeks; Cohen’s d = 0.67) was numerically larger compared to the increase observed for participants with 0–1 prior treatments. For the proportion of negative samples submitted, no significant main effects of prior treatment attempts, F (1, 384) = 0.87, p = .35, ?p2 = 0.002, or treatment condition, F (1, 384) = 0.24, p = .63, ?p2 = 0.001, were present while controlling for age ( p = .55), years of cocaine use ( p = .28), and study ( p < .001). The treatment attempts by treatment condition interaction was not significant, F (1, 384) = 2.48, p = .12, ?p2 = 0.006. Prior Treatment Attempts and 9 Month Posttreatment Outcomes Table 3 presents the unadjusted percentages of negative samples submitted at Month 9 by prior treatment attempts and treatment condition for the available data and when all missing samples were coded as positive samples. We describe the results of the logistic regression predicting abstinence at Month 9 using the available data here, but note that either approach yielded similar results. Step 1 (age, years of cocaine use, study, treatment condition, prior treatment status, and prior treatment status by treatment condition interaction) of the logistic regression was statistically significant, ?2(7, n = 244) = 16.23, p = .023. The addition of Step 2 (mean-centered LDA and the mean-centered LDA by prior treatment status interaction) improved the model, ?2(2, n = 244) = 31.01, p < .001, and yielded acceptable model fit, Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit ?2(8) = 4.63, p = .80. Classification accuracy for the overall model was 79%. Significant predictors included years of cocaine use and the centered LDA variable. For each additional year of cocaine use, odds of submitting a negative specimen at the Month 9 follow-up decreased by 5%, 95% Odds Ratio Confidence Interval: 0.908–0.995. LDA was positively associated with negative urine/breath sample results at Month 9. For every 1 week increase in LDA, odds of submitting a negative specimen increased by 21%, 95% Odds Ratio Confidence Interval: 1.10–1.33. Prior treatment attempt status was not associated with Month 9 specimen results using available data as a main effect, nor as an interaction with treatment condition or with LDA (all p ’s > .05).

For individuals with 0–1 prior treatments, LDA was 1 week longer for CM compared to SC (CM = 4.19 versus SC = 3.25 weeks; Cohen’s d = 0.26). However, among those with multiple prior treatment episodes the effect of CM on LDA (CM = 6.12 versus SC = 4.19 weeks; Cohen’s d = 0.67) was numerically larger compared to the increase observed for participants with 0–1 prior treatments. For the proportion of negative samples submitted, no significant main effects of prior treatment attempts, F (1, 384) = 0.87, p = .35, ?p2 = 0.002, or treatment condition, F (1, 384) = 0.24, p = .63, ?p2 = 0.001, were present while controlling for age ( p = .55), years of cocaine use ( p = .28), and study ( p < .001). The treatment attempts by treatment condition interaction was not significant, F (1, 384) = 2.48, p = .12, ?p2 = 0.006. Prior Treatment Attempts and 9 Month Posttreatment Outcomes Table 3 presents the unadjusted percentages of negative samples submitted at Month 9 by prior treatment attempts and treatment condition for the available data and when all missing samples were coded as positive samples. We describe the results of the logistic regression predicting abstinence at Month 9 using the available data here, but note that either approach yielded similar results. Step 1 (age, years of cocaine use, study, treatment condition, prior treatment status, and prior treatment status by treatment condition interaction) of the logistic regression was statistically significant, ?2(7, n = 244) = 16.23, p = .023. The addition of Step 2 (mean-centered LDA and the mean-centered LDA by prior treatment status interaction) improved the model, ?2(2, n = 244) = 31.01, p < .001, and yielded acceptable model fit, Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit ?2(8) = 4.63, p = .80. Classification accuracy for the overall model was 79%. Significant predictors included years of cocaine use and the centered LDA variable. For each additional year of cocaine use, odds of submitting a negative specimen at the Month 9 follow-up decreased by 5%, 95% Odds Ratio Confidence Interval: 0.908–0.995. LDA was positively associated with negative urine/breath sample results at Month 9. For every 1 week increase in LDA, odds of submitting a negative specimen increased by 21%, 95% Odds Ratio Confidence Interval: 1.10–1.33. Prior treatment attempt status was not associated with Month 9 specimen results using available data as a main effect, nor as an interaction with treatment condition or with LDA (all p ’s > .05).  Discussion As previously established, CM was associated with improved treatment retention and longer durations of abstinence compared to SC. Our focus for the present analyses centered on the impact of prior treatment attempts on treatment outcomes in 393 cocaine abusing participants, and potential interactions between prior treatment and treatment conditions. In contrast to previous work ( Killeen et al., 2007 ) suggesting equivalent benefits of CM treatment regardless of treatment history, our study noted a significant interaction between prior treatment attempts and treatment condition, suggesting a potential benefit of CM over SC for individuals with multiple prior treatment attempts with respect to retention. In contrast to participants with 0–1 prior treatment attempts who achieved similar retention lengths regardless of treatment condition, participants with multiple prior treatment attempts achieved longer retention rates when randomized to CM compared to those in SC and compared to participants with 0–1 prior treatments in either treatment condition. Participants with multiple prior treatment attempts had slightly shorter retention relative to participants with 0–1 prior attempts when in SC. This finding for the SC condition is consistent with previous studies ( Hser et al., 1999a ; Roberts and Nishimoto, 1996 ), which suggest substance abusers with multiple treatment episodes respond more poorly to usual care treatment than those without prior treatment. The improved primary treatment outcomes demonstrated by participants with multiple prior treatment attempts receiving CM are clinically encouraging, as CM may protect against the expected losses in retention for these individuals. A similar pattern (although only a trend) was present for CM to extend the durations of continuous abstinence in participants with multiple prior attempts. These benefits are noteworthy given that extensive treatment history is associated with a host of negative prognostic indicators. Consistent with prior research ( Ferri et al., 2002 ; Hser et al., 1999a ), participants with multiple prior treatment attempts in this study were older, evidenced several indicators of more severe substance use disorders, and had more employment-related problems compared to participants with 0–1 treatment attempts. Given the greater severity of problems, treatments, such as CM, that provide consistent feedback and reinforcement for progress may supply the additional parameters necessary for success and retention during primary treatment among individuals who otherwise respond poorly to SC. Neither prior treatment attempts nor treatment condition were statistically associated with posttreatment abstinence, and contrary to our hypothesis, the interaction between prior treatment attempts and treatment condition was not significant. However, similar to other CM studies ( Higgins et al., 2000 ; Petry et al., 2005a ), LDA was a significant predictor of negative specimen results at Month 9. We find these results encouraging, in that a history of multiple treatment attempts does not interfere with the long-term benefits associated with periods of abstinence during treatment. CM studies are not unique in finding an association between duration of abstinence and abstinence at later timepoints. Data from a large heterogeneous sample of substance abusers suggests that the length of abstinence achieved in the first 7 years posttreatment predicts abstinence at the 8th year ( Dennis, Foss, & Scott, 2007 ). The odds of 8th year abstinence increased as the duration of abstinence lengthened up to 3 years ( Dennis et al., 2007 ). The results of this study are limited by the secondary nature of the analyses, as participants were not randomized to treatment conditions on the basis of treatment history. In addition, self-reported prior treatment attempts may be subject to error, and we did not have objective data available for the duration of stay, type of SUD treatment programs, or prior program completion. The prior treatment attempt categories were chosen based on examination of the distribution of the data and consistency with prior reports ( Killeen et al., 2007 ). The presence of significant differences in substance use disorder severity variables suggests the distinction is clinically meaningful. Future studies may wish to examine additional subgroups, such as individuals with no prior treatment attempts or individuals with high numbers of repeated treatment attempts, as distinct categories. This study is strengthened by the use of a large, heterogeneous sample of treatment-seeking cocaine abusers recruited from multiple community-based treatment clinics. However, the inclusion of multiple randomized clinical trials may be viewed as both a strength and a weakness of the paper. The use of multiple trials extends generalizability of the findings and implies that the findings are not limited to one trial or one specific CM protocol. On the other hand, the variability across trials in terms of patients and CM conditions requires replication of these effects before conclusive practice guidelines can be drawn from these analyses. Given evidence that treatment for addictive disorders is best viewed as a long-term and multiply repeated event ( Scott et al., 2005 ; McLellan et al., 2000 ), patients may need sufficient exposure and opportunity to practice skills that may eventually lead to successful abstinence. Whether CM results in increased coping skill execution or otherwise contributes to treatment-related change processes remains to be seen. This is a topic likely to receive attention in future CM studies as the field moves toward identifying mechanisms of change within specific treatments. While CM is an efficacious treatment for SUDs in general, detection of subgroups that may benefit from CM to a greater degree, or that typically do not benefit from SC treatments, may enhance the dissemination of CM into routine clinical practice. As noted by Witkiewitz and Marlatt (2008) , identification of subgroups for whom SC may not be the best option is necessary, and may advance understanding and effective application of addiction treatments. The present findings suggest that CM may result in improved treatment retention, and possible longer durations of abstinence, for individuals with multiple prior treatments. Overall, the present results provide support for the use of CM with substance abusing individuals with multiple prior treatment attempts.
