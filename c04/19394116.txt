Phenethyl pyridines with non-polar internal substitutents as selective ligands for estrogen receptor beta To create estrogen receptor beta (ER?)-selective ligands with improved biological characteristics, we have extended our investigations of structurally simple bibenzyl-core ligands by preparing a series of compounds in which one phenol is replaced by a 3-hydroxy-pyridine ring. These phenethyl pyridines were obtained by picoline anion alkylation, and compounds with different patterns of alkyl substitution on the central two-carbon unit were prepared. Binding affinities for ER? and ER? were determined, and ligands with promising affinities and selectivities for ER? were further tested for their gene transcriptional activity. Several compounds had high affinity selectivity and good potency selectivity in transcription assays. This study advances our understanding of compounds having ER-subtype selectivity and will help to direct efforts in developing novel ER ligands.  1. Introduction Estrogens, which act through the estrogen receptors (ERs), regulate physiological processes not only in female reproductive tissues [ 1 ], but also in the skeletal [ 2 ], cardiovascular [ 3 ] and central nervous systems [ 4 ] of both males and females. While estrogen pharmaceuticals can provide health benefits in some tissues, they also promote cancer in other sites, such as the breast and the uterus [ 5 , 6 ]. It has proved possible, nevertheless, to create selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), which are compounds that activate the ER selectively only in those tissues where estrogen action is desired, thus supporting estrogen health benefits, while minimizing the risk of cancer [ 7 ]. Tamoxifen [ 8 ] and raloxifene [ 9 ] are well known compounds that show such tissue-dependent estrogen agonist or antagonist effects, and they are currently being used in menopausal hormone replacement therapy to maintain bone mineral density [ 2 ] and for the prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk [ 10 ]. The tissue selectivity of these SERMs is thought to result from conformational characteristics of the ER-ligand complexes that exploit differences in their interactions with cell- and gene-specific coregulatory factors [ 7 , 11 ]. The ER system consists of two subtypes, ER? and ER?, which have different patterns of tissue distribution and transcriptional regulation [ 12 – 14 ], and ER? has proven to have antiproliferative effects in breast cancer cells when it is present together with ER? [ 15 , 16 ]. Although the amino acid sequence identity of ER? and ER? ligand binding domains is only 58%, the residues lining the ligand binding pockets are almost identical. Of the ca. 25 residues lining the pocket, only two are different (Met421 and Leu384 in ER? are replaced by Ile373 and Met336 in ER?); also, the internal volume of the ligand pocket in ER? is about 100 Å3 smaller than that of ER? [ 17 ]. This high sequence identity in the binding pockets of the two ERs creates a challenge in designing highly beta-selective ligands. The phytoestrogen genistein 2 ( Fig. 1 ) has a 20-fold binding selectivity relative to estradiol 1 [ 12 ], and we have described a number of ER?-selective ligands [ 18 – 22 ], for example, the 70-fold selective diarylpropionitrile 3 (DPN) [ 22 ]. Others have reported ER?-selective benzothiazoles [ 23 ], benzimidazoles [ 24 ] and molecules having other types of heterocyclic cores [ 25 – 27 ], in particular, the benzoxazole 4 , with a 200-fold binding preference for ER? [ 25 ]. We recently observed that bibenzyl-core compounds having small, non-polar internal substituents showed unexpectedly highly selectivity for ER? in terms of binding and transcriptional potency [ 28 ]. The most selective ligand of this series was the gem-dimethylated compound 5 ( Fig. 2 ), but monoalkylated analogs that are homologs of isobutestrol 7 [ 20 , 29 ], such as ligand 6 , also showed good ER? selectivity. This finding, that simple bisphenols with non-polar internal substituents were ER? selective, was surprising, because most ER?-selective non-steroidal ligands described previously have distinctly more polar interior substituents [ 20 – 27 , 30 ], as is illustrated by the ligands 2–4 in ( Fig. 1 ). We, therefore, thought that replacing one of the phenols of the bibenzyl core by a 3-hydroxypyridine ring, which would reintroduce an interior polar element into these compounds, might lead to a further increase in their ER? selectivity. In addition, we recently reported related pyridine compounds 8 and 9 , analogs of hexestrol 10 [ 20 ], with both linker carbons bearing one ethyl chain. These compounds showed somewhat promising ER? selectivity, but they had quite low affinity for both ERs, presumably because they were missing the second hydroxyl function, which is considered important for high affinity ER binding [ 31 ]. Therefore, we focused on making the pyridinol analogs having two hydroxyl groups.  2. Chemistry 2.1 Synthesis of ?-Substituted Phenethyl Pyridines Scheme 1 shows the syntheses of phenethyl pyridines bearing different substituents on the linker carbon next to the pyridine ring. The reaction sequences started with the protection of 5-hydroxy-2-methyl pyridine 11 , as previously described [ 32 ]. The bulky t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS)-group was chosen to prevent lithiation of the rather acidic C-2 position of the pyridine ring in the subsequent treatments with LDA. The methyl group of pyridine 12 was smoothly lithiated with LDA at low temperatures, and the anion was reacted with 4-methoxybenzyl chloride [ 20 ], yielding phenethyl pyridine 13 . Lithiation at the same position was repeated in the next step, followed by reaction with alkyl halides, producing compounds 14–16 . We attempted to improve the low yield of compound 14 by employing different alkylating agents: Use of methyl triflate gave only a very polar compound, possibly the N-methylated product; by contrast, use of methyl bromide or methyl iodide gave the desired compound in low yield, but a large amount of starting material could be recovered. Yields of 14 could be improved simply by repeating the reaction on recovered starting material. Deprotection of compounds 13–16 was first attempted in two steps, by reacting them first with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) to remove the TBS-group, followed by treatment with BBr3 in CH2Cl2 to cleave the phenol ether. The mono deprotected compounds resulting from the first reaction, however, were highly polar and insoluble in CH2Cl2. They could be dissolved in DMSO or acetic acid, but no deprotection took place when they were refluxed with NaCN in DMSO for several days. On the other hand, refluxing with hydriodic acid in acetic [ 29 ] gave good yields of the target compounds 17–20 in short reaction times. In addition, we found that the TBS ether function of compounds 13–16 was also cleaved under these conditions. Thus, compounds 17–20 could be obtained from molecules 13–16 in one single step. We also attempted to introduce two alkyl chains at the carbon next to the pyridine ring by alkylating twice. However, when compound 14 was treated with LDA, the deep purple color indicative of the lithiated pyridine, which was observed in all of the alkylations of compounds 12 and 13 , did not appear, and upon addition of the alkyl halide, no reaction took place. Employing the LiKOR and LiDaKOR superbases [ 33 ], which are reported to remove benzylic rather than aromatic protons, gave the same result. Our assumption that the pyridine methylene position in compound 14 is too sterically hindered to be deprotonated by these bases is supported by the fact that literature examples of such anion formations are only reported with less hindered systems [ 33 – 35 ]. Our attempts to use a stronger base, n-BuLi, gave a mixture of decomposition compounds, probably due to lithiation of the aromatic rings or addition to the pyridine ring. 2.2 Synthesis of ?-Substituted Phenethyl Pyridines Scheme 2 illustrates the syntheses of phenethyl pyridines with either one alkyl chain at the benzylic position or one substituent on both linker carbons. In the first step, benzylic alcohols 21 and 22 were chlorinated using SOCl2 to produce compounds 23 and 24 [ 36 ]. These reactions proceeded rapidly and in high yield at ?78 °C to give the benzylic chlorides. They were then reacted with lithiated 12 , as described above in the preparation of 13 , to give phenethyl pyridines 25 and 26 . As before, deprotection using hydriodic acid gave the target compounds 27 and 28 . Further lithiation and ethylation of compounds 25 and 26 yielded the mixtures of diastereomers 29 and 30 . The target compounds 31a , 31b , 32a and 32b could be obtained very efficiently, since it was possible to separate the diastereomers by chromatography after the final deprotection of 29 and 30 .  2.1 Synthesis of ?-Substituted Phenethyl Pyridines Scheme 1 shows the syntheses of phenethyl pyridines bearing different substituents on the linker carbon next to the pyridine ring.

Pharmacology 3.1. Estrogen Receptor Binding Assays The phenethyl pyridines were tested in competitive radiometric binding assays, using purified full-length human ER? and ER?, to determine their binding affinities for the two ERs [ 37 , 38 ]. The binding affinities are expressed relative to that of estradiol, which is set to 100%, to give relative binding affinity (RBAs) values. Table 1 shows the RBAs of the synthesized pyridines and additionally the bibenzyls 6 and 7 , as well as hexestrol 10 and phenethyl pyridines 8 and 9 . CLog P values are also listed in Table 1 . The most ER?-selective phenethyl pyridines were among the ones bearing one alkyl chain on the linker carbon next to the pyridine ring, namely compounds 18 (54-fold) and 19 (80-fold). Both 18 and 19 were more ER? selective than their corresponding bibenzyl analogs, compound 6 (29-fold) and isobutestrol 7 (18-fold) [ 28 ]. This result confirmed our expectations and is consistent with the general finding that ER? selectivity can be achieved with ligands, such as the phenethyl pyridines, that are more polar on the interior than the bibenzyls. However, although the phenethyl pyridines were more ER? selective in their binding, their overall affinity was almost 100-fold less than that of the corresponding bibenzyls. The general trend in this first compound series is that both affinity and selectivity for ER? increases with the chain length of the substituents, reaching a maximum at two carbon atoms ( 17 vs. 18 vs. 19 ); further extension of the chain lowered both affinity and selectivity ( 20 ). Interestingly, the trend shown by 17 , 18 and 19 differs from the more general finding that increased substitution results in higher affinities but lower selectivity, a behavior illustrated by isobutestrol 7 compared to hexestrol 10 [ 20 ], as well as by their stilbene analogs [ 28 ]. Placing the alkyl substituent on the benzylic carbon also resulted in compounds having quite good ER? selectivities, but these were lower than those of the first compound series ( 27 vs. 18 , 28 vs. 19 ). Curiously, at the benzylic position, methyl substitution gave better affinity and selectivity than ethyl substitution ( 18 , 19 vs. 27 , 28 ). The fact that compound 19 showed such good selectivity, together with the observed trend that higher substitution resulted in both increased affinity and selectivity, led us to examine whether the affinity and selectivity of 19 might be improved by introducing a second alkyl chain, on the benzylic position. The anti (R*,S*) isomers of both doubly substituted compounds ( 31b, 32b ) showed markedly increased affinity as desired, but selectivity was reduced in comparison to their mono substituted analogs ( 31b vs. 19 , 27; 32b vs. 19 , 28 ). On the other hand, the syn (R*,R*) isomers ( 31a, 32a ) had much lower affinity than the corresponding anti isomers ( 31a vs. 31b , 32a vs. 32b ). This trend is also known for the meso (R*,S*) and dl (R*,R*) diastereomers of hexestrol [ 29 ], as well as for the monohydroxy reference compounds 8 and 9 , studied earlier [ 20 ]. The lower binding affinity of the monohydroxy phenethyl pyridines 8 and 9 (prepared previously [ 20 ]) compared to the corresponding dihydroxy analogs 32a and 32b is notable. It also suggests that these two ligand sets might be binding to ER in opposite directions: The pyridinol ring of 8 and 9 most probably mimics the A-ring of estradiol, and binding is rather poor because the more polar ring has a less favorable interaction with Phe356 which is near the ligand A-ring in ER?; with the isomers 32 , on the other hand, a phenol could be acting as an A-ring mimic, with consequently higher affinity due to a more favorable interaction of this less polar ring with Phe356 in ER?. Interestingly, with most non-steroidal estrogens, a second hydroxyl group seems important for high affinity binding [ 31 ]. Also of note is the modest affinity of all pyridine derivatives compared to the binding of their bibenzyl analogs. Because the pyridine derivatives are more polar than the bibenzyls (compare estimated CLog P values, Table 1 : 18, 27 vs. 6; 19, 28 vs. 7; 32a, 32b vs. 10 ), it seems reasonable that the pyridines would experience a greater desolvation energy penalty upon moving from water to the ligand binding pocket of the ERs, thus disfavoring the binding process energetically. This desolvation energy penalty experienced by polar ER ligands is evident in other ligand series: The moderately polar alkyl-triaryl-pyrazoles bind much better to ER? than their isostructural but more polar alkyl-triaryl-imidazoles [ 39 ], but less well than their isostructural but less polar furans [ 40 ]. Similarly, the pyridine derivatives of deoxyhexestrol bind better than their more polar pyrimidine analogs, consistent with the higher CLog P values of the former system [ 20 ]. While it is notable that both anti-isomers, 31b and 32b , are less polar (based on their chromatographic behavior) than the corresponding syn-isomers, 31a and 32a , which might account for their higher affinity, the markedly higher ER binding affinity of anti-bibenzyldiols is thought to arise from their preference to adopt a biaryl anti conformation, preferred by the ER ligand binding pocket, rather than a syn conformation [ 29 ]. 3.2. Activity on Gene Transcription The transcriptional activities of six selected compounds ( 18 , 19 , 27 , 31b , 32a , 32b ) that showed good ER? binding selectivity were tested for their agonistic character as regulators of gene transcription, together with estradiol. They were assayed in human endometrial cancer (HEC-1) cells, transfected with expression plasmids for ER? or ER? and an estrogen-responsive reporter gene [ 41 ]. The dose-response curves for these compounds are given in Fig. 3 , and the EC50 are listed in Table 1 . This table also includes, for comparison, the EC50 values for other related compounds determined in a recent study [ 28 ]. To facilitate comparisons of the ER subtype transcriptional potencies of our compounds with their ER subtype binding affinities , the EC50 values from the transcription assays were converted to relative transcriptional potency (RTP) values (See Table 1 , footnote d). The RTPs provide a measure of transcriptional potency relative to that of estradiol and thus can be better compared to their binding affinities, which are also measured relative to estradiol by the competitive radiometric binding assays. Estradiol has a 2.5-fold preference in favor of ER? in terms of binding (Kd [ER?] = 0.2 nM vs. [ER?] = 0.5 nM) and a 5-fold preference in terms of transcriptional potency (EC50 [ER?] = 0.1 nM vs. [ER?] = 0.5 nM). As shown in Figure 3 and listed in Table 1 , the three compounds having the highest ER? relative binding selectivity ( 18 , 19 , and 27 ) also showed good ER? selectivity in terms of transcriptional potency. In fact, the ?/? ratio of their RBA values and their RTP values are quite comparable. The other three compounds ( 31b , 32a , and 32b ), which have generally lower ER? relative binding selectivity, are also less ER? selective in terms of their RTP values. Compound 31b , in fact, has an ER?-potency preference that is greater than that of estradiol; 32b is similar to that of estradiol, but 32a is more ER? selective than estradiol. Irrespective of their ER-subtype selectivities, the higher absolute affinities of the anti disubstituted compounds ( 31b and 32b ) compared to the others ( 18 , 19 , 27 , 31a , and 32a ) is reflected in their overall much higher transcriptional potencies. Compounds 31b and 32b , in particular, were found to be extremely potent, thus being the most potent ligands of the whole series, although they are not at all ER? selective.  3.1.

On the other hand, the syn (R*,R*) isomers ( 31a, 32a ) had much lower affinity than the corresponding anti isomers ( 31a vs. 31b , 32a vs. 32b ). This trend is also known for the meso (R*,S*) and dl (R*,R*) diastereomers of hexestrol [ 29 ], as well as for the monohydroxy reference compounds 8 and 9 , studied earlier [ 20 ]. The lower binding affinity of the monohydroxy phenethyl pyridines 8 and 9 (prepared previously [ 20 ]) compared to the corresponding dihydroxy analogs 32a and 32b is notable.

Experimental Section 5.1. Materials and Methods Reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich and Fisher Scientific. THF and dichloromethane were dried using a solvent-dispensing system (SDS) (neutral alumina columns) built by J.C. Meyer on the basis of a design developed by Pangborn et al. [ 42 ]. Glassware was oven- or flame-dried, assembled while hot, and cooled under nitrogen atmosphere. All reactions were performed in anhydrous solvents and under nitrogen atmosphere, unless stated otherwise. Reaction progress was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using 0.25 mm Merck silica gel 60 glass plates containing F254 UV-Indicator. The plates were visualized by either UV light (254 nm), or by dipping in a solution of potassium permanganate followed by heating. Column chromatography was performed using Woelm 32–63 ?m silica gel packing. 1H and 13C NMR were recorded on Varian UNITY 400 or 500 MHz spectrometers. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm and referenced from solvent references. NMR coupling constants are reported in Hertz. Mass spectra were obtained on a Micromass 70-VSE spectrometer (EI, 70 eV; CI, methane). Melting point (mp) determinations were carried out on Thomas Hoover Unimelt capillary apparatus and are uncorrected. All target compounds shown in scheme 1 could be re-crystallized, while all compounds in scheme 2 could not. They were obtained as oils that spontaneously foamed upon drying to form amorphous solids, which might explain their less distinct melting points. Elemental analyses were performed by the Microanalysis Service Laboratory of the University of Illinois. Analyses indicated by the symbols of the elements or functions were within ± 0.4 % of the theoretical values. 5.2. Chemical Synthesis 5-(<italic>tert</italic>-Butyl-dimthyl-silanoxy)-2-[2-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-ethyl]-pyridine (13) Lithium diisopropyl amide (LDA) (10.5 mL of a 2M solution in heptane/THF/ethylbenzene) was added to 3.5 mL THF at ?78 °C, and then compound 12 (4.00 g, 17.94 mmol, dissolved in 3.5 mL THF) was added dropwise over a time period of 15 min. After 45 min, 1-Chloromethyl-4-methoxy-benzene (2.91 ml, 21.5 mmol, dissolved in 3.5 mL THF) was added in the same manner as 12 and the reaction was stirred for 1 h. The mixture was allowed to go to rt during a 1.5 h time period and stirred for 1 h at rt. The reaction was quenched by adding NH4Cl (sat. aqueous solution) and extracted three times with EtOAc.

Estrogen Receptor Binding Affinity Assays Relative binding affinities were determined by a competitive radiometric binding assay as previously described [ 37 , 38 ], using 10 nM [3H]estradiol as tracer (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), and purified full-length human ER? and ER? (PanVera/InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Incubations were for 18–24 h at 0 °C, then the receptor-ligand complexes were adsorbed onto hydroxyapatite (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and unbound ligand was washed away. The binding affinities are expressed as relative binding affinity (RBA) values, with the RBA of estradiol set to 100. The values given are the average ± range or SD of two or more independent determinations. Estradiol binds to ER? with a Kd of 0.2 nM and to ER? with a Kd of 0.5 nM. 5.4. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections Human endometrial cancer (HEC-1) cells were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) plus phenol-red supplemented with 5% calf serum and were changed to phenol-red-free Improved MEM and 5% charcoal dextran-treated calf serum (CDCS) for 3–4 days before use in experiments. Transfection assays were performed in 24-well plates using a mixture of 0.35 mL of serum-free improved MEM medium and 0.15 mL of Hank’s balanced salt solution containing 5 ?g of lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), 20 ?g of transferrin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 0.2 ?g of pCMV ?-galactosidase as internal control, 0.5 ?g of 2ERE-pS2-Luc, and 50 ng of ER expression vector per well. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-containing incubator for 6 h. The medium was then replaced with fresh Improved MEM supplemented with 5% CDCS plus the desired concentrations of ligands. Cells were harvested 24 h later. Luciferase and ?-galactosidase activity were assayed as described [ 41 ].  5.1. Materials and Methods Reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich and Fisher Scientific. THF and dichloromethane were dried using a solvent-dispensing system (SDS) (neutral alumina columns) built by J.C. Meyer on the basis of a design developed by Pangborn et al. [ 42 ]. Glassware was oven- or flame-dried, assembled while hot, and cooled under nitrogen atmosphere. All reactions were performed in anhydrous solvents and under nitrogen atmosphere, unless stated otherwise. Reaction progress was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using 0.25 mm Merck silica gel 60 glass plates containing F254 UV-Indicator. The plates were visualized by either UV light (254 nm), or by dipping in a solution of potassium permanganate followed by heating. Column chromatography was performed using Woelm 32–63 ?m silica gel packing. 1H and 13C NMR were recorded on Varian UNITY 400 or 500 MHz spectrometers. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm and referenced from solvent references. NMR coupling constants are reported in Hertz. Mass spectra were obtained on a Micromass 70-VSE spectrometer (EI, 70 eV; CI, methane). Melting point (mp) determinations were carried out on Thomas Hoover Unimelt capillary apparatus and are uncorrected. All target compounds shown in scheme 1 could be re-crystallized, while all compounds in scheme 2 could not. They were obtained as oils that spontaneously foamed upon drying to form amorphous solids, which might explain their less distinct melting points. Elemental analyses were performed by the Microanalysis Service Laboratory of the University of Illinois. Analyses indicated by the symbols of the elements or functions were within ± 0.4 % of the theoretical values.  5.2.

Estrogen Receptor Binding Affinity Assays Relative binding affinities were determined by a competitive radiometric binding assay as previously described [ 37 , 38 ], using 10 nM [3H]estradiol as tracer (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), and purified full-length human ER? and ER? (PanVera/InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Incubations were for 18–24 h at 0 °C, then the receptor-ligand complexes were adsorbed onto hydroxyapatite (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and unbound ligand was washed away. The binding affinities are expressed as relative binding affinity (RBA) values, with the RBA of estradiol set to 100. The values given are the average ± range or SD of two or more independent determinations. Estradiol binds to ER? with a Kd of 0.2 nM and to ER? with a Kd of 0.5 nM.  5.4. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections Human endometrial cancer (HEC-1) cells were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) plus phenol-red supplemented with 5% calf serum and were changed to phenol-red-free Improved MEM and 5% charcoal dextran-treated calf serum (CDCS) for 3–4 days before use in experiments. Transfection assays were performed in 24-well plates using a mixture of 0.35 mL of serum-free improved MEM medium and 0.15 mL of Hank’s balanced salt solution containing 5 ?g of lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), 20 ?g of transferrin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 0.2 ?g of pCMV ?-galactosidase as internal control, 0.5 ?g of 2ERE-pS2-Luc, and 50 ng of ER expression vector per well. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-containing incubator for 6 h. The medium was then replaced with fresh Improved MEM supplemented with 5% CDCS plus the desired concentrations of ligands. Cells were harvested 24 h later. Luciferase and ?-galactosidase activity were assayed as described [ 41 ].  4. Conclusion This study extends our investigation of simple, non-steroidal ER?-selective bibenzyl diol ligands having non-polar internal substituents to their corresponding phenethyl pyridinols. The nitrogen-for-carbon substitution in one ring, which transforms a phenol into a pyridinol and makes the interior of the ligand more polar, gives ligands that conform more closely to the “narrow but somewhat polar interior” that characterizes the pharmacophore of most ER?-selective ligands reported to date. Some of the monosubstituted phenethyl pyridinols did exhibit high ER?-selective relative binding affinity and transcriptional potency that in some cases was greater than that of the corresponding bibenzyl diols, but their overall binding affinities were much lower. This reduction in affinity probably comes from the greater desolvation penalty experienced by the more polar pyridine compounds, which tracks with their lower lipophilic character as measured by their lower CLog P values. In reporter gene transcription assays, the ER?-selective transcriptional potencies of the phenethyl pyridinols mirrored quite closely their ER?-selective binding affinities. The vicinally disubstituted phenethyl pyridinols, like the disubstituted bibenzyl diols, showed enhanced ER binding affinity and transcriptional potencies, but reduced ER? selectivities. Unlike other ER?-selective ligands thus far described, polar elements in the interior region of these structurally simple bibenzyl diol and phenethyl pyridinol ligands are not required for their ER - subtype selectivity; in fact, while introducing the polar nitrogen into a benzene to make a pyridine maintained ER? selectivity, it did not improve it, and it uniformly reduced binding affinity. Thus, polar interior elements are not a prerequisite for non-steroidal ER?-selective ligands. Our findings provide further understanding of the design elements that should be considered in the continuing efforts to create ER?-selective ligands with improved biological characteristics.
