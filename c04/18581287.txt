MicroRNA and ovarian cancer Summary Ovarian cancer remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with little change in survival rates over the past 30 years. Research in the molecular biology underlying the disease demonstrates frequent mutation in the p53/Rb/p16 tumor suppressor pathways and activation of c-myc , K-ras and Akt oncogenic signaling. Recently, miRNAs have been demonstrated to play an important role in controlling proliferation, apoptosis and many other processes altered in the cancer state. In this review we discuss a number of recent publications that implicate a role for microRNAs in ovarian cancer and assess how this new field may improve our fundamental understanding of the disease and provide improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.
