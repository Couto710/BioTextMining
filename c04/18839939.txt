Improved synthesis of 6- epi -dictyostatin and antitumor efficacy in mice bearing MDA-MB231 human breast cancer xenografts Structure-activity studies centered on the naturally occurring antitumor agent dictyostatin have recently identified several highly active epimers and analogs. From these compounds, 6- epi -dictyostatin was selected for scaleup preparation and evaluation in animals. Here we describe a new total synthesis that produced more than 30 mg of 6- epi -dictyostatin. The compound was found to have potent antitumor activity in SCID mice bearing MDA-MB231 human breast cancer xenografts.
