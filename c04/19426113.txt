Mycobacterium tuberculosis Interferes with the Response to Infection by Inducing the Host EphA2 Receptor Background Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an unusual pathogen, persisting for years in infected persons despite an immune response. Erythropoietin-producing hepatoma (Eph) receptors are critical for tissue organization. One hallmark of tuberculosis is the presence of granulomas consisting of organized immune cells. The importance of granuloma structure makes it likely that Eph receptors play a role in immunity to tuberculosis. Methods We infected mice with low doses of M. tuberculosis by the aerosol method and examined the effects on ephA gene expression, pathology, composition of lymphocytes in the lungs (by flow cytometry), migration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and numbers of cytokine-expressing cells. Results Mice infected with M. tuberculosis displayed higher expression of ephA1 and ephA2 as well as ephrinA1, which encodes the ligand for EphA1 and EphA2. Interestingly, ephA2 ?/? mice displayed greater pathology, greater accumulation of T cells and dendritic cells, and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines than did normal C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, T cells from ephA2 ?/? mice migrated more efficiently than did those from C57BL/6 mice. Conclusions These observations suggest that ephA -related genes may provide a mechanism that M. tuberculosis uses to circumvent the host response, given that accumulation of T cells appears to be due to the inhibition of immune cell migration by EphA2. Ultimately, the absence of ephA2 results in greater clearance of M. tuberculosis during the chronic phase of infection, suggesting that induction of ephA2 is important for the survival of M. tuberculosis during latency.  Methods Animal experiments Five- to 8-week-old male and female ephA2 gene–disrupted mice ( B6;129S6-Epha2 tm1Jrui /J; stock no. 006028) and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. The ephA2 gene– disrupted mice were made by targeted disruption of exon 5 [ 19 ] in 129SV mice. The ephA2 ?/? homozygotes were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice and maintained by breeding nonagouti siblings for >10 years. This breeding process ensures that mice are homozygous with the C57BL/6 background and contain the ephA2 ?/? mutation, because C57BL/6 genes will segregate with nonagouti genes. All animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal use committee and complied with established guidelines. Bacterial culture and aerosol infection M. tuberculosis Erdman cultures were grown at 37°C in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with 10% albumin-dextrose complex and 0.25% Tween-80 (USB) to an optical density at 600 nm of ?0.8–1. Bacterial viability was assessed by plating on selective Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates (Difco) supplemented with 10% oleic acid–albumin–dextrose complex (MOADC). Mice ( n = 5 per group) were infected with M. tuberculosis by the aerosol method, using a Madison aerosol chamber delivering ?100 bacilli [ 37 ]. Bacterial load determination For each time point, lungs and spleens from infected mice were homogenized. Dilutions were plated on MOADC plates to enumerate colony-forming units. Histopathology and morphometric analyses Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin, and 5- ? m sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, as described elsewhere [ 38 ]. Sections were obtained from different portions of each organ and coded for masked examination, and granulomas were evaluated using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope. Acid-fast bacilli were detected by Ziehl-Nieelsen staining, as described elsewhere [ 39 ]. Morphometric analyses allowed quantification of the percentage of lung involved in granulomas. The ratio of areas of granulomatous to nongranulomatous tissue was determined on digitized images obtained using Image J software (version 1.41; National Institutes of Health). Masked quantification used the entire surface area of 3 separate random sections per mouse for 5 mice per group. Lung cell suspensions Total lung cell suspensions were prepared from infected mice ( n = 4 per group), as described elsewhere [ 10 , 11 ]. Lung cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion [ 40 ]. More than 90% of all cells isolated were viable. Lung cell suspensions had comparable numbers of cells after preparation (?5 × 106 cells) before flow cytometry analysis for all mice. Isolation of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells Spleens from uninfected and infected mice were homogenized, and single-cell suspensions were prepared by passage through a nylon cell strainer (70 ? m). CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations were purified using magnetic cell sorting (Miltenyi Biotech). The purity of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell preparations was verified to be >90% by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry Monoclonal antibodies specific for mouse CD4 (L3T4) and CD8 (Ly-2) were purchased from eBioscience, and monoclonal antibodies specific for CD3 (145-2C11), CD11b (M1/70), and CD11c (HL3) were purchased from BD Pharmingen, all as direct fluorochrome conjugates of fluorescein isothiocyanate, phycoerythrin (PE), PE–cyanine (Cy) 7, or PE-Cy5. Lung cell suspensions were incubated with Mouse Fc Block (BD Pharmingen), stained with specific antibodies, washed with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% sodium azide, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. Intracellular staining was performed to assess cytokine production. Lung cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% saponin before being incubated with anti–interferon (IFN)– ? (XMG1.2), anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF)– ? (MP6-XT22), and anti–IL-4 (11B11) (eBiosciences) directly conjugated to PE. Fluorescence intensity was acquired for 10,000 events for each sample using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 8.5; Treestar). Lymphocyte and macrophage/monocyte populations were gated using forward and side scatter profiles [ 10 , 11 ]. Migration assays Migration assays were performed using 96-well transwell plates (5 ? m) [ 30 ]. Briefly, 3 × 105 fluorescently labeled CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were layered on the top chamber, and medium with or without chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 21 or monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)–1 (100 ng/mL) was added to the bottom chamber. Wells containing medium with CCL21 or MCP-1 in both the top and bottom chambers were included as controls. Cells were allowed to migrate for 2 h at 37°C, collected, and counted by flow cytometry with CountBright absolute counting beads as an internal control (Invitrogen). Total RNA extraction and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis For each time point, cells were lysed using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega), followed by purification using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The quality of RNA was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and concentration was estimated using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (version 3.1.0; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reverse-transcription reactions on total RNA were performed using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) with random decamers. The PCRs were run on a 7500 Real-Time PCR System instrument (Applied Biosystems) [ 41 ], using the primer pairs ephaF3 (5?-CCAACTAGCTCCTGGTCAGC-3?; forward) and ephaR3 (5?-TGCAGCACAGGTTCTGATTC-3?; reverse) for ephA1 and mephA2F (5?-GTCAGATGTGGACTATGGCACCAACT-3?; forward) and mephA2R (5?-TGTGTATCGGAGACAGCGACAGCA-3?; reverse) for ephA2 . The cycle threshold values were used to calculate the relative fold difference in ephA1 and ephA2 gene expression normalized against the expression of gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), one of the most widely used housekeeping genes for transcript normalization. Experiments were repeated 3 times independently. Statistical analysis Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance using Student's t test (2-tailed). Differences with P < .05 were considered statistically significant.  Animal experiments Five- to 8-week-old male and female ephA2 gene–disrupted mice ( B6;129S6-Epha2 tm1Jrui /J; stock no. 006028) and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory.

Results Increases in <italic>ephA</italic>-related transcript levels in the lungs following <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection All data obtained in this study were derived from infecting normal C57BL/6 mice and ephA2 ?/? mice with low doses of M. tuberculosis by the aerosol method in 2 separate experiments. In both experiments, the number of colony-forming units received by the mouse strains was not significantly different: in experiment 1, ephA2 ?/? mice and C57BL/6 mice had a mean ± standard deviation of 77 ± 20 and 92 ± 27 cfu, respectively, on day 1; in experiment 2, ephA2 ?/? mice and C57BL/6 mice had 23 ± 6 and 24 ± 3 cfu, respectively, on day 1. Relative expression of ephA1, ephA2, and ephrinA1 (which encodes the ligand for EphA1 and EphA2) was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Although expression was not significantly different between uninfected and infected mice on day 1 after infection, M. tuberculosis –infected mice expressed ephA1, ephA2, and ephrinA1 ( figure 1 ) at 5–10-fold higher levels than did uninfected mice by 35 days after infection. As expected, we did not observe expression of the ephA2 gene in ephA2 ?/? mice. Interestingly, induction of ephA1 and ephrinA1 expression after M. tuberculosis infection occurred more rapidly in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice. It is possible that ephA -related genes are induced by the host as a mechanism to combat M. tuberculosis infection, by M. tuberculosis to harness natural host pathways in a manner that is beneficial to pathogenesis, or by a combination of these. Larger granulomas in <italic>ephA2</italic><sup>?/?</sup> mice than in C57BL/6 mice after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection Comparison of disease in C57BL/6 and ephA2 ?/? mice should provide insight into whether ephA -related gene induction is beneficial to the host or to M. tuberculosis. We examined the granulomatous response by both qualitative and quantitative analyses of hematoxylin-eosin–stained lung sections. Qualitatively, no obvious differences were observed at the histological level between C57BL/6 mice and ephA2 ?/? mice on days 14 and 21 after infection; both mouse strains displayed similar perivascular and peribronchiolar mixed cell infiltrates. However, on days 35 and 91 after infection, larger granulomas composed of dense mononuclear cell aggregates were observed in the lungs of ephA2 ?/? mice ( figure 2A ). On day 35 after infection, some lesions in ephA2 ?/? mice occupied up to 50% of the total lung section. In contrast, granulomas in C57BL/6 mice harbored more concentric lesions that were clearly demarcated from the surrounding normal lung parenchyma. In addition, granulomas in ephA2 ?/? mice contained a higher number of mononuclear cells on days 35 and 91 after infection ( figure 2B ). Although random foci of macrophage-like cells and foamy macrophages were present in both C57BL/6 mice and ephA2 ?/? mice, mononuclear cells comprised the majority of the lesions in ephA2 ?/? mice. Morphometric analyses revealed statistically significant ( P = .009) differences in the percentage of total lung tissue involved in granuloma formation between ephA2 ?/? mice and C57BL/6 mice on day 91 after infection ( figure 2C ). These observations are suggestive of a more robust inflammatory response in the absence of ephA2 . Higher proportions of T cells and DCs in the lungs of <italic>ephA2</italic><sup>?/?</sup> mice than C57BL/6 mice We investigated the contribution of different immune cells in the lungs of infected mice by means of flow cytometry. We focused on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, because these cells play a critical role in the protective response to M. tuberculosis [ 5 – 7 ]. Examination of the CD3+CD4+ T cell population revealed that these cells were more abundant in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice ( P < .01) ( figure 3A ). This trend continued with time: there was a 3-fold difference in abundance between ephA2 ?/? mice (4.9%) and C57BL/6 mice (16.4%) on day 91 after infection ( P < .001).The CD3+CD8+T cell population displayed differences later, with significantly higher levels in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice beginning on day 35 after infection ( P < .01) ( figure 3B ) that were sustained on day 91 after infection (7.2% for ephA2 ?/? mice vs. 9.5% for C57BL/6 mice; P < 0.01). We characterized DC populations on the basis of their surface expression of CD11b and CD11c [ 10 ]. We found significantly higher percentages of DCs in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice on day 35 after infection ( P < .01). This represents a 5-fold increase in the percentage of DCs relative to that on day 1 after infection in ephA2 ?/? mice ( figure 3C ). These observations suggest that differences in pathology after M. tuberculosis infection are likely to be due to changes in populations of immune cells in the lungs. More efficient migration of T cells from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>–infected <italic>ephA2</italic><sup>?/?</sup> mice than of those from C57BL/6 mice A possible mechanism that might lead to higher proportions T cells and DCs in the lungs of ephA2 ?/? mice after infection with M. tuberculosis would be increased migration of immune cells from peripheral sites. We tested this possibility by measuring the migration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells obtained from the spleens of M. tuberculosis –infected mice in response to a chemokine gradient. T cell migration was measured using transwell assays in the presence of CCL21, a chemokine that is involved in monocyte and lymphocyte recruitment [ 33 , 42 ] and that is induced during M. tuberculosis infection [ 43 ]. We observed statistically significantly higher levels of migration for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from ephA2 ?/? mice in response to CCL21 than for those from C57BL/6 mice ( P < .01) ( figure 4 ). As expected, cells from both ephA2 ?/? mice and C57BL/6 mice migrated poorly in the absence of chemokine. Similarly, there was negligible migration when the chemokine was added to both the upper and lower chamber of the transwell, confirming that the T cells require a chemokine gradient for migration. These observations support the conclusion that the increased pathology and higher proportion of T cells found in ephA2 ?/? mice after M. tuberculosis infection result from the role played by the EphA2 receptor in modulating the migration of T cells. Cytokine production in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>–infected <italic>ephA2</italic><sup>?/?</sup> mice Changes in the proportion of immune cells—particularly T cells and DCs—in the lungs are likely to affect the production of cytokines. We examined the local type 1 T helper (Th1) and type 2 T helper (Th2) cytokine profiles in the lungs by intracellular staining of cell suspensions from C57BL/6 mice and ephA2 ?/? mice infected with M. tuberculosis . The number of IFN- ? –producing cells was statistically significantly higher in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice ( figure 5 ). Similarly, the number of TNF- ? –producing cells was >4-fold higher in ephA2 ?/? mice on day 21 after infection and up to 1.5-fold higher on day 35. Differences in IL-4 production were observed only on day 35 after infection, possibly the result of differences in the production of proinflammatory cytokines at earlier time points. These data indicate that the EphA2 receptor is involved in the modulation of the proinflammatory response to M. tuberculosis infection and suggest that this response induces anti-inflammatory cytokines, possibly to mitigate tissue damage that would result from a robust inflammatory response. Loss of EphA2 improves control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection during the chronic phase Although the above-described observations provide insight into the mechanism responsible for the differences in pathology, it remains unclear how these changes affect disease. Because M. tuberculosis induces ephA -related gene expression in the lungs of mice and because the absence of ephA2 results in a more robust local inflammatory response, it seems likely that loss of ephA2 would negatively affect survival of the bacilli. Survival of M. tuberculosis in ephA2 ?/? mice and C57BL/6 mice was evaluated in 2 independent experiments ( figure 6 ). Despite comparable growth during the acute phase of infection, M. tuberculosis was consistently cleared 3–5-fold more efficiently in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice during the chronic phase of infection, in both the lungs and the spleen ( P < .01). Acid-fast staining confirmed the modestly lower numbers of bacilli in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice 5 weeks after infection (data not shown). The differences in persistence observed are not the result of differences in the initial inoculum, because comparable numbers of bacilli were present in the lungs on day 1 after infection in all mice. These data demonstrate that the absence of ephA2 allows modestly more efficient clearance of M. tuberculosis during the chronic phase of infection, compared with that in C57BL/6 mice, and suggest that induction of ephA -related genes is a mechanism used by M. tuberculosis to hijack host machinery to improve persistence.  Results Increases in <italic>ephA</italic>-related transcript levels in the lungs following <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection All data obtained in this study were derived from infecting normal C57BL/6 mice and ephA2 ?/? mice with low doses of M. tuberculosis by the aerosol method in 2 separate experiments.

Relative expression of ephA1, ephA2, and ephrinA1 (which encodes the ligand for EphA1 and EphA2) was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Although expression was not significantly different between uninfected and infected mice on day 1 after infection, M. tuberculosis –infected mice expressed ephA1, ephA2, and ephrinA1 ( figure 1 ) at 5–10-fold higher levels than did uninfected mice by 35 days after infection. As expected, we did not observe expression of the ephA2 gene in ephA2 ?/? mice. Interestingly, induction of ephA1 and ephrinA1 expression after M. tuberculosis infection occurred more rapidly in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice. It is possible that ephA -related genes are induced by the host as a mechanism to combat M. tuberculosis infection, by M. tuberculosis to harness natural host pathways in a manner that is beneficial to pathogenesis, or by a combination of these.

We characterized DC populations on the basis of their surface expression of CD11b and CD11c [ 10 ]. We found significantly higher percentages of DCs in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice on day 35 after infection ( P < .01). This represents a 5-fold increase in the percentage of DCs relative to that on day 1 after infection in ephA2 ?/? mice ( figure 3C ). These observations suggest that differences in pathology after M. tuberculosis infection are likely to be due to changes in populations of immune cells in the lungs. More efficient migration of T cells from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>–infected <italic>ephA2</italic><sup>?/?</sup> mice than of those from C57BL/6 mice A possible mechanism that might lead to higher proportions T cells and DCs in the lungs of ephA2 ?/? mice after infection with M. tuberculosis would be increased migration of immune cells from peripheral sites.

T cell migration was measured using transwell assays in the presence of CCL21, a chemokine that is involved in monocyte and lymphocyte recruitment [ 33 , 42 ] and that is induced during M. tuberculosis infection [ 43 ]. We observed statistically significantly higher levels of migration for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from ephA2 ?/? mice in response to CCL21 than for those from C57BL/6 mice ( P < .01) ( figure 4 ). As expected, cells from both ephA2 ?/? mice and C57BL/6 mice migrated poorly in the absence of chemokine. Similarly, there was negligible migration when the chemokine was added to both the upper and lower chamber of the transwell, confirming that the T cells require a chemokine gradient for migration. These observations support the conclusion that the increased pathology and higher proportion of T cells found in ephA2 ?/? mice after M. tuberculosis infection result from the role played by the EphA2 receptor in modulating the migration of T cells. Cytokine production in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>–infected <italic>ephA2</italic><sup>?/?</sup> mice Changes in the proportion of immune cells—particularly T cells and DCs—in the lungs are likely to affect the production of cytokines. We examined the local type 1 T helper (Th1) and type 2 T helper (Th2) cytokine profiles in the lungs by intracellular staining of cell suspensions from C57BL/6 mice and ephA2 ?/? mice infected with M. tuberculosis . The number of IFN- ? –producing cells was statistically significantly higher in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice ( figure 5 ). Similarly, the number of TNF- ? –producing cells was >4-fold higher in ephA2 ?/? mice on day 21 after infection and up to 1.5-fold higher on day 35. Differences in IL-4 production were observed only on day 35 after infection, possibly the result of differences in the production of proinflammatory cytokines at earlier time points. These data indicate that the EphA2 receptor is involved in the modulation of the proinflammatory response to M. tuberculosis infection and suggest that this response induces anti-inflammatory cytokines, possibly to mitigate tissue damage that would result from a robust inflammatory response. Loss of EphA2 improves control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection during the chronic phase Although the above-described observations provide insight into the mechanism responsible for the differences in pathology, it remains unclear how these changes affect disease. Because M. tuberculosis induces ephA -related gene expression in the lungs of mice and because the absence of ephA2 results in a more robust local inflammatory response, it seems likely that loss of ephA2 would negatively affect survival of the bacilli. Survival of M. tuberculosis in ephA2 ?/? mice and C57BL/6 mice was evaluated in 2 independent experiments ( figure 6 ). Despite comparable growth during the acute phase of infection, M. tuberculosis was consistently cleared 3–5-fold more efficiently in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice during the chronic phase of infection, in both the lungs and the spleen ( P < .01). Acid-fast staining confirmed the modestly lower numbers of bacilli in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice 5 weeks after infection (data not shown). The differences in persistence observed are not the result of differences in the initial inoculum, because comparable numbers of bacilli were present in the lungs on day 1 after infection in all mice. These data demonstrate that the absence of ephA2 allows modestly more efficient clearance of M. tuberculosis during the chronic phase of infection, compared with that in C57BL/6 mice, and suggest that induction of ephA -related genes is a mechanism used by M. tuberculosis to hijack host machinery to improve persistence.  Increases in <italic>ephA</italic>-related transcript levels in the lungs following <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection All data obtained in this study were derived from infecting normal C57BL/6 mice and ephA2 ?/? mice with low doses of M. tuberculosis by the aerosol method in 2 separate experiments. In both experiments, the number of colony-forming units received by the mouse strains was not significantly different: in experiment 1, ephA2 ?/? mice and C57BL/6 mice had a mean ± standard deviation of 77 ± 20 and 92 ± 27 cfu, respectively, on day 1; in experiment 2, ephA2 ?/? mice and C57BL/6 mice had 23 ± 6 and 24 ± 3 cfu, respectively, on day 1. Relative expression of ephA1, ephA2, and ephrinA1 (which encodes the ligand for EphA1 and EphA2) was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Although expression was not significantly different between uninfected and infected mice on day 1 after infection, M. tuberculosis –infected mice expressed ephA1, ephA2, and ephrinA1 ( figure 1 ) at 5–10-fold higher levels than did uninfected mice by 35 days after infection. As expected, we did not observe expression of the ephA2 gene in ephA2 ?/? mice. Interestingly, induction of ephA1 and ephrinA1 expression after M. tuberculosis infection occurred more rapidly in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice. It is possible that ephA -related genes are induced by the host as a mechanism to combat M. tuberculosis infection, by M. tuberculosis to harness natural host pathways in a manner that is beneficial to pathogenesis, or by a combination of these.

Larger granulomas in <italic>ephA2</italic><sup>?/?</sup> mice than in C57BL/6 mice after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection Comparison of disease in C57BL/6 and ephA2 ?/? mice should provide insight into whether ephA -related gene induction is beneficial to the host or to M. tuberculosis. We examined the granulomatous response by both qualitative and quantitative analyses of hematoxylin-eosin–stained lung sections. Qualitatively, no obvious differences were observed at the histological level between C57BL/6 mice and ephA2 ?/? mice on days 14 and 21 after infection; both mouse strains displayed similar perivascular and peribronchiolar mixed cell infiltrates. However, on days 35 and 91 after infection, larger granulomas composed of dense mononuclear cell aggregates were observed in the lungs of ephA2 ?/? mice ( figure 2A ). On day 35 after infection, some lesions in ephA2 ?/? mice occupied up to 50% of the total lung section. In contrast, granulomas in C57BL/6 mice harbored more concentric lesions that were clearly demarcated from the surrounding normal lung parenchyma. In addition, granulomas in ephA2 ?/? mice contained a higher number of mononuclear cells on days 35 and 91 after infection ( figure 2B ). Although random foci of macrophage-like cells and foamy macrophages were present in both C57BL/6 mice and ephA2 ?/? mice, mononuclear cells comprised the majority of the lesions in ephA2 ?/? mice. Morphometric analyses revealed statistically significant ( P = .009) differences in the percentage of total lung tissue involved in granuloma formation between ephA2 ?/? mice and C57BL/6 mice on day 91 after infection ( figure 2C ). These observations are suggestive of a more robust inflammatory response in the absence of ephA2 .

Higher proportions of T cells and DCs in the lungs of <italic>ephA2</italic><sup>?/?</sup> mice than C57BL/6 mice We investigated the contribution of different immune cells in the lungs of infected mice by means of flow cytometry. We focused on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, because these cells play a critical role in the protective response to M. tuberculosis [ 5 – 7 ]. Examination of the CD3+CD4+ T cell population revealed that these cells were more abundant in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice ( P < .01) ( figure 3A ). This trend continued with time: there was a 3-fold difference in abundance between ephA2 ?/? mice (4.9%) and C57BL/6 mice (16.4%) on day 91 after infection ( P < .001).The CD3+CD8+T cell population displayed differences later, with significantly higher levels in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice beginning on day 35 after infection ( P < .01) ( figure 3B ) that were sustained on day 91 after infection (7.2% for ephA2 ?/? mice vs. 9.5% for C57BL/6 mice; P < 0.01). We characterized DC populations on the basis of their surface expression of CD11b and CD11c [ 10 ]. We found significantly higher percentages of DCs in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice on day 35 after infection ( P < .01). This represents a 5-fold increase in the percentage of DCs relative to that on day 1 after infection in ephA2 ?/? mice ( figure 3C ). These observations suggest that differences in pathology after M. tuberculosis infection are likely to be due to changes in populations of immune cells in the lungs.

More efficient migration of T cells from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>–infected <italic>ephA2</italic><sup>?/?</sup> mice than of those from C57BL/6 mice A possible mechanism that might lead to higher proportions T cells and DCs in the lungs of ephA2 ?/? mice after infection with M. tuberculosis would be increased migration of immune cells from peripheral sites. We tested this possibility by measuring the migration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells obtained from the spleens of M. tuberculosis –infected mice in response to a chemokine gradient. T cell migration was measured using transwell assays in the presence of CCL21, a chemokine that is involved in monocyte and lymphocyte recruitment [ 33 , 42 ] and that is induced during M. tuberculosis infection [ 43 ]. We observed statistically significantly higher levels of migration for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from ephA2 ?/? mice in response to CCL21 than for those from C57BL/6 mice ( P < .01) ( figure 4 ). As expected, cells from both ephA2 ?/? mice and C57BL/6 mice migrated poorly in the absence of chemokine. Similarly, there was negligible migration when the chemokine was added to both the upper and lower chamber of the transwell, confirming that the T cells require a chemokine gradient for migration. These observations support the conclusion that the increased pathology and higher proportion of T cells found in ephA2 ?/? mice after M. tuberculosis infection result from the role played by the EphA2 receptor in modulating the migration of T cells.

Cytokine production in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>–infected <italic>ephA2</italic><sup>?/?</sup> mice Changes in the proportion of immune cells—particularly T cells and DCs—in the lungs are likely to affect the production of cytokines. We examined the local type 1 T helper (Th1) and type 2 T helper (Th2) cytokine profiles in the lungs by intracellular staining of cell suspensions from C57BL/6 mice and ephA2 ?/? mice infected with M. tuberculosis . The number of IFN- ? –producing cells was statistically significantly higher in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice ( figure 5 ). Similarly, the number of TNF- ? –producing cells was >4-fold higher in ephA2 ?/? mice on day 21 after infection and up to 1.5-fold higher on day 35. Differences in IL-4 production were observed only on day 35 after infection, possibly the result of differences in the production of proinflammatory cytokines at earlier time points. These data indicate that the EphA2 receptor is involved in the modulation of the proinflammatory response to M. tuberculosis infection and suggest that this response induces anti-inflammatory cytokines, possibly to mitigate tissue damage that would result from a robust inflammatory response.

Loss of EphA2 improves control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection during the chronic phase Although the above-described observations provide insight into the mechanism responsible for the differences in pathology, it remains unclear how these changes affect disease. Because M. tuberculosis induces ephA -related gene expression in the lungs of mice and because the absence of ephA2 results in a more robust local inflammatory response, it seems likely that loss of ephA2 would negatively affect survival of the bacilli. Survival of M. tuberculosis in ephA2 ?/? mice and C57BL/6 mice was evaluated in 2 independent experiments ( figure 6 ). Despite comparable growth during the acute phase of infection, M. tuberculosis was consistently cleared 3–5-fold more efficiently in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice during the chronic phase of infection, in both the lungs and the spleen ( P < .01). Acid-fast staining confirmed the modestly lower numbers of bacilli in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice 5 weeks after infection (data not shown). The differences in persistence observed are not the result of differences in the initial inoculum, because comparable numbers of bacilli were present in the lungs on day 1 after infection in all mice. These data demonstrate that the absence of ephA2 allows modestly more efficient clearance of M. tuberculosis during the chronic phase of infection, compared with that in C57BL/6 mice, and suggest that induction of ephA -related genes is a mechanism used by M. tuberculosis to hijack host machinery to improve persistence.

Discussion This is the first study to demonstrate that EphA receptors play a role in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis infection. We have developed a working model to guide additional studies examining the role played by EphA receptors and their ligand, EphrinA1, in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis ( figure 7 ). Our data indicate that EphA2 can modulate the immune response during M. tuberculosis infection by altering T cell recruitment, immune cell composition in the lungs, and cytokine production. In light of these observations, it is likely that M. tuberculosis induces the expression of Eph receptors and EphrinA1, which act in a coordinated fashion to reduce the migration of T cells and DCs to the site of infection, producing an environment that is conducive to bacterial persistence. In the absence of EphA2, as in our transgenic mouse model, T cells and DCs migrate to the site of infection more readily and produce an immune response that modestly improves bacterial clearance during the chronic phase of infection and that is beneficial to the host. We found that ephA1, ephA2, and ephrinA1 are induced after infection with M. tuberculosis . Because the absence of EphA2 results in improved clearance of M. tuberculosis during the chronic phase of infection, it is likely that induction of ephA -related genes is a virulence mechanism of M. tuberculosis . Our observations are consistent with those of previous studies describing induction of Eph receptor gene expression in monocytic cells by M. tuberculosis at 24–48 h after infection [ 35 , 36 ], although the time points at which induction is observed in mice are much later (21–35 days), most likely because of the use of monocytic cells alone rather than the whole lung tissue used in the present study. The greater induction of ephA1 and ephrinA1 in ephA2 ?/? mice than in C57BL/6 mice suggests that sensitivity to stimulation is increased in the absence of EphA2. It is possible that EphA1 and EphA2 are at least partially functionally redundant, suggesting that a double ephA2/ephA1 mutant could display a more obvious phenotype. Further investigation of the role played by Eph receptors during infectious diseases and the interactions of these receptors with each other and different components of the immune system will provide insight into the mechanisms of the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis infection. It would be interesting to examine bacterial mutants that affect survival during latency, because they may display more-pronounced differences in clearance between wild-type mice and ephA2 ?/? mice, providing insight into the mechanisms involved. Our transwell migration assays demonstrated that CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cells from the spleens of ephA2 ?/? mice migrate more efficiently than do those from C57BL/6 mice. As a result, the total numbers of CD4+ T cells become higher in the lungs of ephA2 ?/? mice than of C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, larger lesions are observed in ephA2 ?/? mice, making it likely that the enhanced mononuclear cell accumulation is due to dynamic changes in T cell migration. Previous studies have shown that CD4+ T cell migration is inhibited in response to a gradient of stromal cell–derived factor–1 ? and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)–3 ? chemokines after EphA receptor stimulation with EphrinA1 [ 19 , 23 ]. That T cells respond to CCL21 suggests that a mechanism by which EphA2 alters migration occurs through this cytokine. Interestingly, MIP-3 ? is a ligand for the chemokine receptor CCR7, which also binds to CCL21 and is up-regulated in M. tuberculosis –activated human DCs [ 32 , 33 ], and CCL21 is induced within granulomas in the lungs of M. tuberculosis –infected mice [ 43 ]. Because a lack of ephA2 enhances T cell chemotaxis in response to CCL21, it is likely that interactions between EphA2 and EphrinA1 negatively regulate the migration of murine T cells, similar to human T cells and endothelial cells [ 23 , 31 ]. Therefore, it is likely that the absence of EphA2 alters transvasation of immune cells during M. tuberculosis infection. Although increased T cell recruitment could account for the formation of larger granulomas, we cannot rule out the possibility that local proliferation, efflux from the lungs, or cell death play a role. However, our observations support the hypothesis that one of the mechanisms by which EphA2 affects the host immune response to M. tuberculosis is through modulation of immune cell recruitment. We also found that the absence of EphA2 leads to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs. This suggests a regulatory role for EphA2 in balancing the immune response to M. tuberculosis . It is possible that the increased levels of IFN- ? and TNF- ? are due to the increased number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Under normal conditions, expression of EphA2 would help to control production of IFN- ? and TNF- ? , preventing excess inflammation in the lungs. M. tuberculosis has the ability to subvert this host defense mechanism by inducing higher-than-normal levels of Eph receptors. However, in ephA2 ?/? mice, a more robust IFN- ? and TNF- ? response occurs, ultimately leading to greater bacterial clearance. That increased IL-4 production occurs immediately after the increase in both IFN- ? and TNF- ? levels suggests that IL-4 plays a regulatory role in reestablishing equilibrium. Interactions between EphA and EphrinA1 can suppress the production of IL-4 by human peripheral blood CD4+ T cells [ 22 ]. Therefore, a defect in EphA2 expression would most likely impair the regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine production, skewing the protective immune response from a Th1 toward a Th2 immune response. The present data indicate, for the first time, that EphA2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis infection in mice and has clear repercussions for the immunopathological outcome of tuberculosis. The absence of ephA2 affects the cellular immune response to low-dose aerosol infection with M. tuberculosis in the lungs. We have identified a novel mechanism by which EphA receptors affect T cell migration in M. tuberculosis –infected mice. As a consequence of T cell infiltration, IFN- ? and TNF- ? production increase, promoting the development of larger granulomas and improving bacterial clearance. These observations provide the first insight into the physiological and pathological importance of this key class of receptors in infectious diseases. We have unveiled a novel component of pathogenesis through identification of the EphA2 receptor as a modulator of the immune response to M. tuberculosis .
