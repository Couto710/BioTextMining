Significantly skewed memory CD8 + T cell subsets in HIV-1 infected infants during the first year of life 1 HIV-1 infection causes a severe T cell compromise; however, little is known about changes in naïve, memory, effector and senescent T cell subsets during the first year of life. T cell subsets were studied over the first year of life in blood from 3 infant cohorts: untreated HIV-infected, HIV-exposed but uninfected, and HIV-unexposed. In HIV-infected infants, the frequency of CCR7+CD45RA+ naïve CD8+ T cells was significantly decreased, whilst the frequency of CCR7?CD45RA? effector memory CD8+ T cells was increased, compared with the control cohorts. A larger population of CD8+ T cells in HIV-infected infants displayed a phenotype consistent with senescence. Differences in CD4+ T cell subset frequencies were less pronounced, and no significant differences were observed between exposed and unexposed HIV-uninfected infants. We concluded that the proportion of naïve, memory, effector and senescent CD8+ T cells during the first year of life is significantly altered by HIV-1 infection.  Participant characteristics Among 298 infants born to HIV+ mothers enrolled, 20 were ultimately identified as HIV+ by a positive viral amplification test. The number of patients in the HIV+ group decreased gradually over the 12 month period ( Table I ): 8 infants died early during the study, conducted during a period when ART was not routinely available in South Africa, and 4 infants were lost to follow-up. Three infants received ART, resulting in exclusion from analysis. Twenty five of the 278 non-infected infants born to HIV-infected mothers were included in the “Exposed HIV?“ group. Eleven of these infants were lost to follow-up over their first year or life. Twenty three infants born to HIV-negative mothers (termed “HIV?“) were also enrolled. Of these, 4 were ultimately lost to follow-up. At 3 months of age, blood of only 16 of 20 HIV+ infants was examined.  Total, CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts and viral load There were no differences in total lymphocyte counts between the groups, at all time points ( Table I ). The frequencies of CD4+ lymphocytes in the HIV+ group were lower than in the other groups ( Figure IA ), while absolute numbers differed between the HIV+ and the HIV? groups at 6 months of age ( Table I ). The frequencies of CD8+ T cells were significantly higher in the HIV+ group, compared with the other 2 groups ( Figure IB ), and absolute numbers were higher in HIV+ infants than in the other 2 groups at 3 months. As expected, the ratios of CD4+ to CD8+ T cell frequencies were significantly reduced in the HIV+ group, compared with the other groups ( Figure IC ). Participants from the HIV+ group had a detectable plasma HIV-1 viral load, which showed a characteristic gradual decline over the first year of life ( Table I ).  Memory phenotype of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells To investigate the memory phenotype of CD8+ T cells, we determined the expression of CD45RA and CCR7, or of CD45RA and CD62L, by flow cytometry ( Figure II ). The frequency of naïve CD8+ T cells (CD8+ TNaïve; CD45RA+CCR7+) was approximately 3-fold lower in HIV+ infants at 3 months of age, compared with infants from the other 2 groups ( Figure IIC ; Supplementary Figure IA ). This frequency decreased in all groups over the next 9 months, but HIV+ infants had consistently lower frequencies throughout ( Figure IIC , Supplementary Figure IA ). Differences between groups were not as prominent when the absolute number of CD8+ TNaïve cells was evaluated ( Figure IIE ; Supplementary Figure IIA ); however, the HIV? group had an increased CD8+ TNaïve subset, compared with the Exposed HIV? group, at 6 and 12 months. Very similar patterns were observed when CD62L was substituted for CCR7 in the analysis (data not shown). The frequency of effector memory CD8+ T cells (CD8 TEM; CD45RA?CCR7?) was significantly higher in the HIV+ group at all time points, compared with the other 2 groups, and increased over time in all groups ( Figure IID , left panel, Supplementary Figure IB ). The absolute numbers of CD8+ TEM cells followed a similar pattern ( Figure IIF left panel; Supplementary Figure IIB ). A mixed effects linear regression modelling of this data also demonstrated significant differences in the naïve and effector CD8 T cell subsets between the HIV-infected group and the control groups ( Supplementary Figure 5 ). At 3 months of age, HIV+ infants also had a significantly higher frequency of CD8+ TEM cells that re-expressed CD45RA (TEM45RA), compared with the Exposed HIV? group ( Figure IID middle panel, Supplementary Figure IC ). At later time points there were no differences in the frequency of these cells for the 3 groups, but absolute numbers were higher in HIV+ infants throughout the first year of life ( Figure IIF middle panel; Supplementary Figure IIC ). Again, when CD62L was substituted for CCR7, similar patterns were observed (data not shown). The frequencies of central memory CD8+ T cells (TCM) in the 3 groups, were extremely low when CCR7 was used to define this subset (CD45RA?CCR7+) ( Figure IID , right panel, Supplementary Figures ID ). When CD62L was used instead of CCR7 to define TCM, increased frequencies and absolute numbers of CD8 TCM cells could be detected in the HIV+group, compared with the other 2 groups, over the first year of life ( Figure IID , right panel; Supplementary Figures ID and IID ).  Memory phenotype of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells Phenotypic differences in CD4+ T cells were far less pronounced than in the CD8+ T cells, with only occasional differences that were significant between HIV+ and the HIV? infants ( Figure III ; Supplementary Figures III and IV ). Interestingly, CCR7 appeared to be a better marker to differentiate subsets, compared with CD62L. There were no dramatic differences between Exposed HIV? infants and HIV? infants in any of the CD4+ T cell subsets.  Expression of CD28 and CD57 The absolute number of CD8+ T cells expressing the senescence marker CD57 was higher in the HIV+ group at most time points, compared with the HIV? Exposed group. Surprisingly, expression of this marker tended to be higher in HIV? infants, compared with Exposed HIV? infants ( Figure IVA ). The absolute number of CD8+ T cells not expressing the costimulatory molecule CD28 was markedly higher in HIV+ infants, compared with the others, at most time points ( Figure IVB ). CD57 and CD28 expression on CD4+ T cells was not different between the groups (data not shown).  Methods Study population Infants born to HIV-infected and non-infected women from the Worcester region of the Western Cape, South Africa, were enrolled before the age of 3 months. HIV-1 infection status was determined in infants by PCR, and each was classified into 1 of 3 groups: non-HIV-infected born to a non-HIV-infected mother (HIV?), non-HIV-infected born to an HIV-infected mother (Exposed HIV?), or HIV-infected (HIV+). During the study period, roll-out of antiretroviral therapy (ART) as part of the mother-to-child HIV transmission prevention programme commenced. Toward the end of the project, roll-out of ART for treatment pediatric HIV-1 infection was also initiated. Infants who received ART were excluded from the analysis. The protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Cape Town, and by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. Good clinical practice and ethical guidelines of the US Department of Health and Human Services and the South African Medical Research Council were followed in the conduct of the project; this included written informed parental consent. Blood collection EDTA-anticoagulated peripheral blood was collected from the infants at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. In addition to the immunological analysis reported here, a complete blood count and HIV-1 viral load (EasyQ HIV1, version1.2 bioMérieux NucliSens®) were performed at each timepoint. Flow cytometric and hematology analysis Whole blood was transported at room temperature to the laboratory and processed within 4 hours of collection. Fifty microlitres of whole blood were incubated with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies against CD3-PE, CD4-allophycocyanin, CD8-PerCP, CD45-FITC, CD45RA-FITC, CCR7-PE, CD62L-PE, CD28-PE, and CD57-PE (all obtained from BD Biosciences), in different combinations, at room temperature for 30 minutes. Red cells were then lysed with FACS lysing solution (BD Biosciences), and white cells fixed in 1% para-formaldehyde. All cells were acquired on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), equipped for four colour detection, using Cellquest (BD Biosciences). Analysis was completed using Flowjo (Treestar) software. A complete blood count was performed on all infants, allowing calculation of absolute numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, as CD45 was used in flow cytometric panels to delineate total lymphocyte populations. A rigorous gating strategy was employed which was consistently applied to all participants. All antibodies in the panels were optimally titrated before use in the study. Statistical considerations The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test, with Dunn’s Multiple Comparison Test, were used to evaluate differences between study groups, and these statistical tests were performed using Prism 4.03 (GraphPad). A mixed effects linear regression model was used to compare the time profiles of the CD8 T cell populations ( Supplementary Figure 5 ). Maximum likelihood estimation was used so that the models coped with missing data arising from infant drop-out because observations at each time point influences estimates of treatment or other effects at every other time point due to the specification of the covariance pattern[ 31 ]. Where data was not normally distributed, values were log transformed.

Discussion This is a comprehensive report of changes in memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets in untreated HIV-infected infants (HIV+), which were also compared with HIV-exposed but uninfected infants (Exposed HIV?), and with HIV-unexposed infants (HIV?). The data show skewing of predominantly CD8+ T cell populations in HIV-infected infants, compared with the other infant groups. As early as 3 months after birth, the frequency of naïve CD8+ T cells was markedly reduced in HIV+ infants. In HIV-infected adults, loss of naïve T cells is the result of increased immune differentiation, driven by immune activation, which is characteristic of HIV-1 infection [ 32 ; 33 ; 34 ; 35 ]. In adults, the naïve CD4+ T cell compartment is more severely depleted than the CD8 compartment [ 11 ]. We found that loss of naïve CD8+ T cells was more prominent in infants, whereas Mc Closkey et al. reported a significant loss of naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells in the first year of life [ 14 ], and Gallagher et al. demonstrated a significant decrease in naïve CD8 T cells already at 6 weeks of age [ 36 ]. Naive T cell loss perturbs T cell homeostasis and consequently, thymic output [ 11 ]. Clinical studies have shown that thymic dysfunction is associated with rapid progression of disease in perinatally infected infants [ 25 ; 37 ; 38 ]. The numbers and proportions of effector memory CD8+ T cells (TEM) were significantly increased at all time points in HIV-infected infants. Such maturational skewing is well described in HIV-infected adults [ 22 ; 39 ]. The clonal expansion of antigen-specific effector T cells is important for immunity against primary infections, whereas the development and maintenance of memory T cell populations is critical for protective immunity against reinfections. HIV-driven, non-specific maturation may thus be particularly detrimental to the development of immunological memory in infants. Our results contrast with findings of Jordan, et al. , who failed to show changes in the distribution of memory and effector T cell populations in children aged 2–14 [ 22 ]; however, the latter study investigated very small cohorts of 10 HIV-infected and 4 uninfected children, and all HIV-infected children had received ART. The CD8+ TEMRA population, effector memory cells that have re-expressed CD45RA, was also increased in HIV+ infants, compared with Exposed HIV? infants. This increase has also been reported in adult HIV-1 infection [ 22 ], and may reflect chronic immune activation that drives cells into a state of terminal differentiation. Expression of the costimulatory molecule CD28 and of the senescence marker CD57 were also different between our infant groups. CD8+ T cells of HIV-infected infants displayed a phenotype consistent with senescence, with low CD28 and elevated CD57 expression. HIV-specific CD8+ T cells detected very early after birth, in utero-infected infants [ 40 ; 41 ; 42 ], may therefore be prone to senescence, and be less functional, especially in the absence of specific CD4+ T cell help [ 40 ; 43 ; 44 ]. These phenotypes have been shown to be prevalent in HIV? infected adults with high viremia, where the senescent T cells have also shown reduced proliferative capacity [ 9 ; 45 ]. Similarly, adults [ 46 ; 47 ; 48 ; 49 ; 50 ] and children [ 14 ; 21 ] with high viral replication characteristically have CD8+ T cell downregulation of CD28, which leads to dysregulation of normal T cell function. Interestingly, we found that HIV-exposed but uninfected infants expressed significantly lower levels of CD57 than HIV-1 unexposed infants. This result was surprising, since increased immune activation is expected in exposed HIV-uninfected infants [ 13 ; 28 ; 29 ; 30 ], which should result in greater T cell senescence, compared with unexposed infants. Further study would be necessary to clarify this finding. CCR7 and CD62L expression are often used interchangeably with CD45RA to define memory subsets. We showed that in infants, significant differences between the expression of these 2 markers do exist. For example, populations of central memory CD8+ T cells were detectable only when CD62L was used, and CCR7 was a better marker to define effector memory CD4+ T cells. We do not know why these markers were not equivalently useful to delineate T cell subsets in infants, but this warrants further inspection, and these differences should be taken into account when measuring these subsets in infant studies. The significant drop-out rates, primarily due to death of HIV-infected infants later in the first year of life, constituted a limitation of our study. These death rates were consistent with those observed in other cohorts of African infants not on antiretroviral therapy [ 26 ]. We therefore also assessed our results with maximum likelihood mixed effects linear regression modelling, which copes with loss to follow-up. These models showed results that were similar to those without applying the models. In turn, sensitivity of the models were tested by applying three different methods of imputation of missing data and comparing this with analysis of just those patients who had complete data: there was excellent agreement between the results of all four analyses (data not shown). Invariably, results from HIV-uninfected infants remained different from HIV-infected infants. Additionally, we did not prospectively address covariates that could have had an effect on infant immunity, such as maternal viral load and immune status, maternal thereapy, infant nutritional status, and additional infections in infants. Regardless, the T cell phenotype in HIV-infected infants during the first year of life remained strikingly different to the control groups. We therefore believe this study’s results are unique and completely novel, particularly as the current routine availability of antiretroviral therapy precludes this kind of study from ever being repeated. To conclude, the changes in T cell phenotype reported here suggest a gross dysfunction in T cell development and maturation in HIV-infected infants. A reduction of CD4+ T cells and increase in CD8+ T cells, with lower CD4/CD8 ratios, in HIV-infected infants is well documented [ 25 ]; however, we now demonstrate, in addition, that subsets of these cells are also significantly altered. Furthermore, the observation that total lymphocyte counts between the 3 groups are similar indicates that there is a re-distribution of the existing T cells from the CD4 to the CD8 compartment, and from naive T cells to effector T cells. In contrast, very little difference between HIV exposed but uninfected and HIV-1 unexposed infants was observed. The findings from this study indicate that T cell memory subsets are severely disrupted in HIV-infected infants, and this may have dire implications on the efficacy of childhood vaccination, and may contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality of infected infants. Our novel results also underscore the positive impact that early antiretroviral therapy may have in reversing the abnormal immune profile. This hypothesis is substantiated by recent findings of markedly improved clinical outcome of infants who have started antiretroviral therapy at 6 weeks of age, or at the earliest time point after HIV diagnosis, compared with infants who have started therapy at later ages [ 51 ].  Discussion This is a comprehensive report of changes in memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets in untreated HIV-infected infants (HIV+), which were also compared with HIV-exposed but uninfected infants (Exposed HIV?), and with HIV-unexposed infants (HIV?). The data show skewing of predominantly CD8+ T cell populations in HIV-infected infants, compared with the other infant groups. As early as 3 months after birth, the frequency of naïve CD8+ T cells was markedly reduced in HIV+ infants. In HIV-infected adults, loss of naïve T cells is the result of increased immune differentiation, driven by immune activation, which is characteristic of HIV-1 infection [ 32 ; 33 ; 34 ; 35 ]. In adults, the naïve CD4+ T cell compartment is more severely depleted than the CD8 compartment [ 11 ]. We found that loss of naïve CD8+ T cells was more prominent in infants, whereas Mc Closkey et al. reported a significant loss of naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells in the first year of life [ 14 ], and Gallagher et al. demonstrated a significant decrease in naïve CD8 T cells already at 6 weeks of age [ 36 ]. Naive T cell loss perturbs T cell homeostasis and consequently, thymic output [ 11 ]. Clinical studies have shown that thymic dysfunction is associated with rapid progression of disease in perinatally infected infants [ 25 ; 37 ; 38 ]. The numbers and proportions of effector memory CD8+ T cells (TEM) were significantly increased at all time points in HIV-infected infants. Such maturational skewing is well described in HIV-infected adults [ 22 ; 39 ]. The clonal expansion of antigen-specific effector T cells is important for immunity against primary infections, whereas the development and maintenance of memory T cell populations is critical for protective immunity against reinfections. HIV-driven, non-specific maturation may thus be particularly detrimental to the development of immunological memory in infants. Our results contrast with findings of Jordan, et al. , who failed to show changes in the distribution of memory and effector T cell populations in children aged 2–14 [ 22 ]; however, the latter study investigated very small cohorts of 10 HIV-infected and 4 uninfected children, and all HIV-infected children had received ART. The CD8+ TEMRA population, effector memory cells that have re-expressed CD45RA, was also increased in HIV+ infants, compared with Exposed HIV? infants. This increase has also been reported in adult HIV-1 infection [ 22 ], and may reflect chronic immune activation that drives cells into a state of terminal differentiation. Expression of the costimulatory molecule CD28 and of the senescence marker CD57 were also different between our infant groups. CD8+ T cells of HIV-infected infants displayed a phenotype consistent with senescence, with low CD28 and elevated CD57 expression. HIV-specific CD8+ T cells detected very early after birth, in utero-infected infants [ 40 ; 41 ; 42 ], may therefore be prone to senescence, and be less functional, especially in the absence of specific CD4+ T cell help [ 40 ; 43 ; 44 ]. These phenotypes have been shown to be prevalent in HIV? infected adults with high viremia, where the senescent T cells have also shown reduced proliferative capacity [ 9 ; 45 ]. Similarly, adults [ 46 ; 47 ; 48 ; 49 ; 50 ] and children [ 14 ; 21 ] with high viral replication characteristically have CD8+ T cell downregulation of CD28, which leads to dysregulation of normal T cell function. Interestingly, we found that HIV-exposed but uninfected infants expressed significantly lower levels of CD57 than HIV-1 unexposed infants. This result was surprising, since increased immune activation is expected in exposed HIV-uninfected infants [ 13 ; 28 ; 29 ; 30 ], which should result in greater T cell senescence, compared with unexposed infants. Further study would be necessary to clarify this finding. CCR7 and CD62L expression are often used interchangeably with CD45RA to define memory subsets. We showed that in infants, significant differences between the expression of these 2 markers do exist. For example, populations of central memory CD8+ T cells were detectable only when CD62L was used, and CCR7 was a better marker to define effector memory CD4+ T cells. We do not know why these markers were not equivalently useful to delineate T cell subsets in infants, but this warrants further inspection, and these differences should be taken into account when measuring these subsets in infant studies. The significant drop-out rates, primarily due to death of HIV-infected infants later in the first year of life, constituted a limitation of our study. These death rates were consistent with those observed in other cohorts of African infants not on antiretroviral therapy [ 26 ]. We therefore also assessed our results with maximum likelihood mixed effects linear regression modelling, which copes with loss to follow-up. These models showed results that were similar to those without applying the models. In turn, sensitivity of the models were tested by applying three different methods of imputation of missing data and comparing this with analysis of just those patients who had complete data: there was excellent agreement between the results of all four analyses (data not shown). Invariably, results from HIV-uninfected infants remained different from HIV-infected infants. Additionally, we did not prospectively address covariates that could have had an effect on infant immunity, such as maternal viral load and immune status, maternal thereapy, infant nutritional status, and additional infections in infants. Regardless, the T cell phenotype in HIV-infected infants during the first year of life remained strikingly different to the control groups. We therefore believe this study’s results are unique and completely novel, particularly as the current routine availability of antiretroviral therapy precludes this kind of study from ever being repeated. To conclude, the changes in T cell phenotype reported here suggest a gross dysfunction in T cell development and maturation in HIV-infected infants. A reduction of CD4+ T cells and increase in CD8+ T cells, with lower CD4/CD8 ratios, in HIV-infected infants is well documented [ 25 ]; however, we now demonstrate, in addition, that subsets of these cells are also significantly altered. Furthermore, the observation that total lymphocyte counts between the 3 groups are similar indicates that there is a re-distribution of the existing T cells from the CD4 to the CD8 compartment, and from naive T cells to effector T cells. In contrast, very little difference between HIV exposed but uninfected and HIV-1 unexposed infants was observed. The findings from this study indicate that T cell memory subsets are severely disrupted in HIV-infected infants, and this may have dire implications on the efficacy of childhood vaccination, and may contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality of infected infants. Our novel results also underscore the positive impact that early antiretroviral therapy may have in reversing the abnormal immune profile. This hypothesis is substantiated by recent findings of markedly improved clinical outcome of infants who have started antiretroviral therapy at 6 weeks of age, or at the earliest time point after HIV diagnosis, compared with infants who have started therapy at later ages [ 51 ].
