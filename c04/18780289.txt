The ING Gene Family in the Regulation of Cell Growth and Tumorigenesis The five members of the inhibitor of growth (ING) gene family have garnered significant interest due to their putative roles as tumor suppressors. However, the precise role(s) of these ING proteins in regulating cell growth and tumorigenesis remains uncertain. Biochemical and molecular biological analysis has revealed that all ING members encode a PHD finger motif proposed to bind methylated histones and phosphoinosital, and all ING proteins have been found as components of large chromatin remodeling complexes that also include histone acetyl transferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes, suggesting a role for ING proteins in regulating gene transcription. Additionally, the results of forced overexpression studies performed in tissue culture have indicated that several of the ING proteins can interact with the p53 tumor suppressor protein and/or the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-?B) protein complex. As these ING-associated proteins play well-established roles in numerous cell processes, including DNA repair, cell growth and survival, inflammation, and tumor suppression, several models have been proposed that ING proteins act as key regulators of cell growth not only through their ability to modify gene transcription but also through their ability to alter p53 and NF-?B activity. However, these models have yet to be substantiated by in vivo experimentation. This review summarizes what is currently known about the biological functions of the five ING genes based upon in vitro experiments and recent mouse modeling efforts, and will highlight the potential impact of INGs on the development of cancer.  Conclusions and Future Directions Although much has been learned about the newly emerging family of ING tumor suppressors, there remain many questions regarding the functional role of ING proteins in development, in regulation of cell growth and death, and in tumorigenesis. At present, only mice deficient for Ing1 have been reported. As multiple functions for each ING have been indicated by transfection studies and by biochemical analysis, and as some of these functions appear to be shared by several ING proteins, it will likely be necessary to generate and study mice deficient for each of the Ing genes in order to dissect the unique and overlapping functions of the various ING family members. In addition, analysis of mice bearing several Ing gene mutations will also be needed to document compensation for loss of a single ING protein by other ING proteins. It is quite possible that the absence of a p53-dependent phenotype in the Ing1 mouse studies might be due to overlapping effects exerted by one or more of the other ING family members on p53. In conclusion, ING genes appear to encode chromatin-modifying proteins that can regulate a variety of cellular processes, including tumorigenesis, and alterations in ING protein levels or localization can be found in a variety of human cancers. In addition, mice deficient for Ing1 have indicated that Ing1 suppresses the development of spontaneous follicular B cell lymphomas, although further epidemiological studies are needed to determine the significance of Ing1 loss in human lymphomagenesis. Furthermore, several in vivo mouse studies and transfection studies performed in cultured cells have indicated that there are p53-independent roles for ING proteins in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Thus, other candidate signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis that might be modulated by INGs need to be explored further. Although ING1 and ING4 have been proposed to regulate the NF-?B pathway, more work is needed to better dissect the mechanisms by which these ING proteins alter NF-?B activity and to determine if other ING proteins can also affect NF-?B signaling. Other important questions regarding the role of ING proteins in cell growth control involves the methods by which cells regulate these proteins under normal conditions and in cancer, as little is known about the effects of ING protein modifications on ING functions. Given that recent work has substantiated that the ING proteins function as bone fide tumor suppressors, further functional studies of the role of the ING genes in development and disease are clearly warranted.  Figures and Tables Fig. 1 Genomic organization of mouse and humanINGfamily members. Human ING genes are depicted on the top of each part and are in gray. Mouse Ing genes are depicted on the bottom and in black. Figure shows genomic structure of each gene and each alternatively spliced transcript with proteinmasses in kiloDaltons. Shaded region for each transcript represents protein coding region. Currently, extensive studies of genomic organization have been conducted for human and mouse ING1 and for human ING2-5. Shown for mouse ING2-5 is the predicted genomic organization and alternative splice variants. Fig. 2 Domain structure of human ING proteins. The domain composition and approximate location for each domain is shown for various ING proteins. Also shown for ING1 are the two known phosphorylation sites at serine 126 and 199. 14-3-3 binds to phosphorylated serine 199 and facilitates translocation from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Serine 126 is phosphorylated by CDK1 under non-stressed conditions and by CHK1 under DNA-damaging conditions. This site has also been reported to affect the half-life ofING1andits ability to repress the expression of CyclinB1. Each INGprotein is predicted to have three conserved regions, which are a PHD domain (Plant Homeodomain), NCR(Novel Conserved Region), and NLS(Nuclear Localization Sequence). The NLS has been reported to be the putative region which binds to p53. A Leucine Zipper-Like (LZL) domain is present in ING2-5. Little is known about this domain, but it was reported to affect the ability of ING2 to function in DNA repair and apoptosis. ING1 also has a PBD (Partial Bromodomain) and a PIP (PCNA-Interacting Protein Motif) domain. The PBD domain appears to bind to the SAP30 subunit of the mSin3-HDAC complex. Both ING1and ING2 have a PBR (Poly Basic Region) domain, which appears to be involved with phosphoinositide binding. The domain structures for mouse Ing proteins have not been characterized.
