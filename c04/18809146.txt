Human papillomavirus-related Diseases: Oropharynx Cancers and Potential Implications for Adolescent HPV Vaccination Molecular and epidemiological data now support an etiologic role for oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) in oral cancers in women and men. Recent studies have demonstrated an increase in the incidence of HPV-associated oral cancers in the United States (US). Moreover, the incidence rates for these cancers are higher in men than women. Oral HPV infections acquired through oral sex appear to be the principal risk factor for HPV-associated oral cancers. Despite reports in the popular press that the prevalence of oral sexual behaviors is increasing in the adolescent population, trends in these behaviors over time are largely unavailable. However, data indicate that oral-genital contact is frequently practiced among adolescents; adolescents do not typically consider this a risky behavior. The majority of oral cancers (approximately 90%) caused by HPV are identified as HPV 16 positive. Therefore, HPV-associated oral cancers could be prevented by a prophylactic vaccine if the vaccine were demonstrated to be capable of preventing oral HPV 16 infection. These findings have created new potential opportunities for the primary prevention of oral cancers.  Conclusion It is now apparent that HPV is a causal factor for a distinct group of oral cancers that occur more frequently in men than women. Sexual behavior is associated with risk for this cancer. HPV 16 is found in the majority of HPV-positive oral cancers. The increasing incidence of HPV-associated oral cancer (oropharyngeal cancer) in the US underscores the potential importance of cancer prevention via HPV prophylactic vaccination of both women and men. Currently, vaccines targeted against oncogenic HPV infection have been indicated for use in women only. Vaccinating males against oncogenic HPV infection may be a particularly important approach for the prevention of oral cancer, given the incidence is higher in men. Clinical trials are in progress to determine the efficacy of such vaccines in preventing genital oncogenic HPV infection in men. Clinical trials to evaluate the potential for vaccines to prevent oral HPV 16 infection are in the developmental stages. In the absence of such clinical trial data, vaccine effectiveness may only be evaluable via surveillance of cancer incidence rates in vaccinated populations over the next several decades.
