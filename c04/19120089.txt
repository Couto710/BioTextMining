From Hans Selye’s Discovery of Biological Stress to the Identification of Corticotropin Releasing Factor signaling pathways: Implication in Stress-Related Functional Bowel Diseases Selye’s pioneer the concept of biological stress in 1936 culminating to the identification of the corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) signaling pathways by Vale’s group in the last two decades. The characterization of the 41 amino-acid CRF and other peptide members of the mammalian CRF family, urocortin 1, urocortin 2 and urocortin 3, the cloning of CRF1 and CRF2 receptors, which display distinct affinity for CRF ligands, combined with the development of selective CRF receptor antagonists enable to unravel the importance of CRF1 receptor in the stress-related endocrine (activation of pituitary-adrenal axis), behavioral (anxiety/depression, altered feeding), autonomic (activation of sympathetic nervous system) and immune responses. The activation of CRF1 receptors is also part of key mechanisms through which various stressors impact the gut to stimulate colonic propulsive motor function and to induce hypersensitivity to colorectal distension as shown by the efficacy of the CRF1 receptor antagonists in blunting these stress-related components. The importance of CRF1 signaling pathways in the visceral response to stress in experimental animals provided new therapeutic approaches for treatment of functional bowel disorder such as irritable bowel syndrome, a multifactor functional disorder characterized by altered bowel habits and visceral pain for which stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology and is associated with anxiety-depression in subset of patients.  CONCLUSIONS As we are entering Selye’s centennial anniversary (1907–1982), and as former Ph.D. Selye student (YT), it is gratifying to see how much has been accomplished since his pioneer description of the stress concept emphasing the activation of the HPA as key component. Through the relentless efforts of several groups, the biochemical coding of the CRF/Ucns-CRF1/CRF2 receptor signaling pathways has been identified and characterized to coordinate the various facets of the response to stress. In particular, the activation of CRF1 receptors plays a pivotal role in the HPA stimulation and anxiogenic response to various stressors. In addition, consistent preclinical reports established that the activation of CRF1 receptors by CRF also recapitulates key symptomes of IBS-diarrhea predominent patients as it relates to stimulation colonic motility, watery diarrhea, mucus secretion, mast cell activation, visceral hyperalgesia, and anxiogenic/hypervigilance that are alleviated by various selective CRF1 receptors antagonists ( Table 1 ). Preliminary clinical studies also support a role of the CRF signaling system in the induction of IBS-like symptoms in healthy subjects and highten sensivity in IBS patients that are alleviated by a peptide CRF antagonist. 115 Targetting CRF1 receptor may provide a new therapeutic venue in the treatment of IBS. 24  Figures and Tables Figure 1 From Selye to unraveling the biochemical coding of stress response: the mentoring linkage.
