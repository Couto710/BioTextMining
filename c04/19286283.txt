Bibenzyl- and stilbene-core compounds with non-polar linker atom substituents as selective ligands for estrogen receptor beta A series of structurally simple bibenzyl-diol and stilbene-diol core molecules, structural analogs of the well-known hexestrol and diethylstilbestrol non-steroidal estrogens, were prepared and evaluated as estrogen receptor (ER) subtype-selective ligands. Analysis of their ER? and ER? binding showed that certain substitution patterns engendered binding affinities that were >100-fold selective for ER?. When further investigated in cell-based gene transcription assays, some molecules showed similarly high relative transcriptional potency selectivity in favor of ER?. Interestingly, the most ER?-selective molecules were those bearing non-polar substituents on one of the internal carbon atoms. These compounds should be useful probes for determining the physiological roles of ER?, and they might lead to the development of more selective and thus safer pharmaceuticals.  1. Introduction The estrogen receptor (ER) is a member of a superfamily of nuclear receptors (NRs) that are ligand-modulated transcription factors mediating the action of steroid hormones and various other bioactive ligands [ 1 ]. ER ligands regulate not only the female reproductive system, but also play an important role in other tissues, maintaining bone mineral density, regulating blood-lipid profiles [ 2 , 3 ], and supporting brain function [ 4 ]. The positive effects of estrogens are generally the basis for their use in the treatment of postmenopausal osteroporosis [ 5 ], atherosclerosis [ 6 ], and Alzheimer’s disease [ 7 ]. While the stimulation of ER has important benefits in some tissues, it can, however, increase the risk of cancer in the breast and uterus [ 8 , 9 ]. Much interest has therefore been focused on the development of more tissue-selective estrogens, notably the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), that might be safer and more effective pharmaceuticals [ 10 ]. The tissue selective effect of SERMs is thought to result from differential cell and promoter-specific interactions [ 11 ]. The newer ER subtype, ER? was discovered in 1996 and is encoded by a gene different from the one encoding the classical receptor (now referred to as ER?) [ 12 – 16 ]. The overall amino acid identity of the two ER subtypes is 44%, with the DNA-binding domains being nearly identical but the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) being less conserved (58% amino acid sequence identity). The ligand-binding pockets (LBPs) of ER? and ER?, however, are very similar and differ in only two amino acids, with Met421 and Leu384 in ER? being substituted in ER? by Ile373 and Met336, respectively. Perhaps more significantly, the internal volume of the ligand-binding pocket of ER? is somewhat smaller than in ER? [ 17 ]. The fact that the two ER subtypes have different patterns of tissue distribution and transcriptional regulation has opened new opportunities for creating SERMs with improved tissue selectivity that would derive from ER? vs. ER? selective binding affinity and transcriptional potency [ 16 ]. Such ER subtype-selective ligands could be effective probes of the respective biological roles of ER? and ER?. They could also be used to study the conformation of receptor subtype agonist and antagonist complexes. Moreover, new ER subtype-selective SERMs might function as improved tissue-selective estrogens for the treatment of a variety of estrogen-linked diseases [ 15 , 18 , 19 ]. The isoflavone phytoestrogen, genistein 2 , with a ca. 20-fold ER? relative binding affinity selectivity, was the first compound known to be selective for ER? ( Fig. 1 ) [ 16 ]. Among synthetic estrogens, the isocoumarin 3 and the benzoxazole 4 (also known as ERB-041) are reported to have 40-fold [ 20 ] and 200-fold [ 21 ] relative binding affinity selectivities for ER?, respectively. The latter represents the most ER?-selective ligand known so far and has been in clinical trials. We previously described a series of compounds having a bibenzyl core and bearing polar substituents on the central ethylene unit. The most selective ligand of this series was diarylpropionitrile (DPN) 5 , which had a 70-fold ER? relative binding selectivity ( Fig. 2 ) [ 22 ]. Other compounds showing ER? selectivity and possessing different core structures have been developed by us and others [ 20 , 23 – 28 ], and a pharmacophore model has evolved from these studies. According to this model, an ER?-selective ligand has a structurally slender core with hydroxyl groups at both ends and polar or polarizable groups in the interior of the ligand; this pharmacophore ( Fig. 3 ) is illustrated by DPN 5 and compounds 2 – 4 in Fig. 1 . Notably, estradiol ( 1 ), the main endogenous estrogen and the typical standard for comparison with other ligands, has modest binding and transcriptional potency preference in favor of ER?. Recently, we reexamined isobutestrol 6 , a compound that has long been known for its low affinity for ER? [ 29 , 30 ], and we were pleased to find that this simple compound had good affinity and an 18-fold relative binding selectivity for ER?. Interestingly, isobutestrol 6 is rather non-polar at its center, which stands in contrast to the pharmacophore model ( Fig. 3 ). Isobutestrol ( 6 ) also has much higher ER? binding selectivity than its more familiar congeners, hexestrol 7 and diethylstilbestrol (DES) 8 [ 29 ] (cf., Table 1 ), although its absolute affinity is lower. Because of the encouraging ER? selectivity of isobutestrol 6 , we decided to investigate analogs having various, mostly non-polar substitution patterns on the central ethylene group of the bibenzyl core, to see whether we might obtain ligands with even greater ER? selectivities. In this study, we describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of such bibenzyl-core compounds, and, in some cases, evaluation of their unsaturated stilbene analogs.  2. Chemical Synthesis 2.1 Synthesis of Monoalkyl Bibenzyl and Stilbene Diols Scheme 1 illustrates the syntheses of bibenzyl-core compounds and stilbenes with one of the two carbons of the central ethylene unit bearing one alkyl chain. All syntheses started with the introduction of alkyl substituents into desoxyanisoin 9 by Grignard addition. Steric effects had a strong influence on the reaction yields, which were excellent for small and moderate for large Grignard reagents. To complete the preparation of the bibenzyl-core compounds, the intermediate alcohols 10 – 14 were dehydroxylated [ 31 ] to give molecules 15 – 19 . These conversions took only about 30 min and gave excellent yields. In the final deprotection step, the phenolic hydroxy groups were revealed in convenient overnight reactions at room temperature using BBr3, furnishing the target compounds 6 and 21 – 25 in very good yields [ 32 ]. The stilbene derivatives 26 – 28 were obtained by treating racemic alcohols 10 – 12 with BBr3 at low temperature, which effected dehydration as well as deprotection of the methoxy groups in a single step [ 32 ]. The elimination took place at ?78 °C, and while no ether cleavage appeared at that temperature, when the reactions were allowed to warm to 0 °C, deprotection occurred rapidly, and the stilbenes were obtained in moderate yield. The stilbene derivatives proved to be much more sensitive to the acidic reaction conditions than their saturated analogs 6 , 21 and 22 . Extended reaction time especially at room temperature gave low yields, most possibly due to acid-catalyzed polymerization. However, it is noteworthy that the olefin formation occurred with remarkable regio-and stereoselectivity. In case of 27 and 28 , the trans-stilbenes were the major products, with only small amounts of the corresponding cis-isomers and both possible styrene derivatives being evident. In the case of compound 26 , the trans-isomer was the only product isolated. In addition, a certain amount of decomposition products were obtained, possibly a result of polymerization of possible styrene intermediates, which have a terminal and thus more reactive double bond than those of the stilbene species. The geometry of the alkenes was assigned initially by the chemical shift of the olefinic proton. In accordance to literature data on similar molecules [ 33 ], we found that the signal of the vinylic proton of the trans-isomers was significantly shifted down field in comparison to the cis-isomers (?? ? 0.25). This assignment was verified further with NOE studies, exemplified with compounds 26 and 27 . Irradiation of the vinylic proton (? 6.70, 6.54 for 26 , 27 , respectively) yielded enhancements of the neighboring aromatic protons meta to the phenolic hydroxyl ( 26 : ? 7.39, 13.7%; ? 7.22, 8.3%; 27 : ? 7.33, 12.6%, ? 7.19, 8.3%), without exhibiting detectable enhancement of the methylene protons trans to it. These results are in agreement with those obtained with similar molecules that were also investigated by NOE studies [ 34 ]. 2.2 Synthesis of Geminally Disubstituted Bibenzyl Diols Scheme 2 shows the synthesis of bibenzyl-core compounds bearing either one or two alkyl chains on one of the carbons of the central ethylene, and in some cases having an additional carbonyl function on the other carbon. Starting with ketone 9 , the alkyl chains were introduced by enolate alkylation to obtain the substituted ketones 29a , 30a and 31 within only 30 min at room temperature. In accordance with literature precedent [ 35 ], an excess of base and alkylating agent gave the monoalkylated products in good yields, together with much smaller amounts of the corresponding bis-alkylated compounds. Since the enolate is not preformed in that procedure, it is noteworthy that when one equivalent of base and iodoalkane were used, only a single alkyl chain was introduced selectively. In the next step, the second alkyl chain was introduced in the same manner to give the disubstituted ketones 32a and 33–35 . Subsequent removal of the carbonyl oxygen [ 36 ] in convenient overnight reactions at room temperature furnished the protected products 36a , 37a , 38a and 39a . Employing the BBr3 deprotection method described above gave the final bisphenol products 29b , 30b , 32b , 36b , 37b , 38b and 39b . 2.3 Synthesis of Spirocyclic Bibenzyl Diols The introduction of spirocycles onto the central ethylene of the bibenzyl-core started with the double alkylation of ketone 9 using ?,?-dibromoalkanes ( Scheme 3 ). In the literature protocol we followed [ 37 ], the reaction is performed at room temperature and takes about two days, but we were able to obtain compounds 40 and 41 within a few hours in good yields by refluxing the reaction mixtures. Despite our use of different bases and reaction conditions, we were unable to prepare smaller spirocycles by this method. The subsequent decarbonylation and deprotection reactions were performed as in case of the acyclic analogs described above, to furnish molecules 42a , 43a, and the final compounds 42b, 43b .  2.1 Synthesis of Monoalkyl Bibenzyl and Stilbene Diols Scheme 1 illustrates the syntheses of bibenzyl-core compounds and stilbenes with one of the two carbons of the central ethylene unit bearing one alkyl chain.

The subsequent decarbonylation and deprotection reactions were performed as in case of the acyclic analogs described above, to furnish molecules 42a , 43a, and the final compounds 42b, 43b .  3. Pharmacology 3.1 Estrogen Receptor Binding Assays The relative binding affinities (RBA) of the compounds we prepared were measured in a competitive radiometric binding assay using purified full-length human ER? and ER? [ 38 , 39 ]. The binding affinities are listed in Table 1 and are expressed as relative binding affinity (RBA) values, that is, relative to the affinity of estradiol, which is set at 100%. The table includes also the RBA values of isobutestrol 6 , DPN 5 , hexestrol 7 , and DES 8 . All chiral compounds were tested as racemates. Among the 18 target compounds we have prepared, eight ( 21 , 22 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 36b , 37b , 38b ) were found to have an ER? selectivity equal to or higher than the reference compound isobutestrol 6 , with compounds 25 , 26 , 37b and in particular 36b being the most selective ones (48-, 56-, 66- and 125-fold, respectively). With the exception of compound 25 , all of these compounds had also quite good ER? binding affinity. The highest affinity was observed with compounds 22 and 27 , having RBA values of 68 and 76, respectively, which is almost twice as high as isobutestrol 6 and even four times higher than DPN 5 . The series of monosubstituted bibenzyl compounds having a propyl or shorter substituent R on the central ethylene showed an interesting trend: Compound 25 (R = H) was the most selective one, but it also had the lowest affinity. Increasing the chain length led to higher affinities; however, the affinity for ER? increased faster than for ER?, resulting overall in lower ER? selectivity. Thus, compound 22 (R = Pr) had the highest affinity, while still having good selectivity. On the other hand, branching or further increasing the size of the substituent lowered the selectivity as well as the affinity ( 23 , 24 ). Interestingly, when one of the two carbons of the ethylene unit was di-substituted with small alkyl chains, the ER? selectivity was higher compared to the corresponding mono-substituted analogs ( 36b , 37b vs. 21 , 6 ). It is known that the two ethyl chains of hexestrol 7 and diethylstilbestrol (DES) 8 fit nicely into the 7? and 11? subpockets of the ERs [ 40 ], resulting in high affinity but very low selectivity. In comparison, isobutestrol 6 with just one ethyl chain on the two linking carbons, has lower affinity, but increased ER? selectivity. In this study, we found the same behavior in case of the stilbene analogs: Monoethylstilbestrol 27 had lower affinity than DES, but increased ER? selectivity. The monomethylstilbestrol 26 had even higher selectivity than monoethylstilbestrol 27 , or compound 21 , the saturated analog of 26 . In general, increasing the size of substituents ( 36b , 37b vs 38b , 39b ) or constraining them into a spirocycle ( 38b , 39b vs 42b , 43b ) gave lower selectivities and affinities for both ERs. These lower affinities suggest that these compounds are too large or too rigid to fit well into the LBD pockets of the ERs. The decrease in ER? selectivity is consistent with the larger ligand-binding pocket of ER?, which is being better able to accommodate the large and constrained ligands than ER?. Another trend noted is that the compounds with a carbonyl function on the central ethylene had much lower affinities and selectivities than their reduced analogs ( 29b vs. 21; 30b vs. 6; 32b vs. 36b ). 3.2 Activity in Gene Transcription Eight compounds ( 21 , 22 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 36b , 37b , and 38b ) that showed good selectivity between ER? and ER? in the binding assay were tested for their agonistic character as regulators of gene transcription. They were assayed in a cotransfection assay in human endometrial cancer (HEC-1) cells, using expression plasmids for either ER? or ER? and an estrogen-responsive reporter gene [ 41 ]. The dose-response curves for these compounds are given in Fig. 4 , and the EC50 values are listed in Table 1 . This table also includes the EC50 values for our ER?-selective ligand, DPN 5 , for comparison. All chiral compounds were tested as racemates. To facilitate comparisons of the ER subtype transcriptional potencies of our compounds with their ER subtype binding affinities , the EC50 values from the transcription assays were converted to relative transcriptional potency (RTP) values (See Table 1 , footnote c). The RTPs provide a measure of transcriptional potency relative to that of estradiol and thus can be better compared to their binding affinities, which are also measured relative to estradiol by the competitive radiometric binding assays. Estradiol has a 2.5-fold preference in favor of ER? in terms of binding (Kd [ER?] = 0.2 nM vs. [ER?] = 0.5 nM) and a 5-fold preference in terms of transcriptional potency (EC50 [ER?] = 0.1 nM vs. [ER?] = 0.5 nM). Of the eight compounds tested, seven showed very good potency selectivity for ER? (note RTP ratio) that was either very similar to their RBA ratios (compounds 21 , 25 , 36b , and 38b ) or at least of the same magnitude (compounds 22 , 26 , and 37b ); only compound 27 showed no ER? transcriptional potency preference yet had good ER? binding preference. Thus, our findings show overall a very good concordance of relative binding affinities and relative transcriptional potencies. This was not always the case, however, because affinity represents binding to the ER, whereas potency can also depend on other factors that can depend on the cell and promoter context: The interactions that ER-agonist ligand complexes have with coregulators and promoter elements can vary, depending on the precise conformations of the ER that are induced by binding to ligands of different structure, irrespective of their binding affinity. Compared to our previously prepared ER?-selective ligand, DPN 5 , some of the compounds we present here have higher ER? binding affinity (compounds 6 , 21 , 22 , 24 , 27 , 28 , and 37b ) and comparable or higher ER? binding selectivity (compounds 25 , 26 , 36b , and 37b ) and somewhat less to nearly equivalent ER? transcriptional potency (compounds 21 and 36b ).  3.1 Estrogen Receptor Binding Assays The relative binding affinities (RBA) of the compounds we prepared were measured in a competitive radiometric binding assay using purified full-length human ER? and ER? [ 38 , 39 ]. The binding affinities are listed in Table 1 and are expressed as relative binding affinity (RBA) values, that is, relative to the affinity of estradiol, which is set at 100%. The table includes also the RBA values of isobutestrol 6 , DPN 5 , hexestrol 7 , and DES 8 . All chiral compounds were tested as racemates. Among the 18 target compounds we have prepared, eight ( 21 , 22 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 36b , 37b , 38b ) were found to have an ER? selectivity equal to or higher than the reference compound isobutestrol 6 , with compounds 25 , 26 , 37b and in particular 36b being the most selective ones (48-, 56-, 66- and 125-fold, respectively). With the exception of compound 25 , all of these compounds had also quite good ER? binding affinity. The highest affinity was observed with compounds 22 and 27 , having RBA values of 68 and 76, respectively, which is almost twice as high as isobutestrol 6 and even four times higher than DPN 5 . The series of monosubstituted bibenzyl compounds having a propyl or shorter substituent R on the central ethylene showed an interesting trend: Compound 25 (R = H) was the most selective one, but it also had the lowest affinity. Increasing the chain length led to higher affinities; however, the affinity for ER? increased faster than for ER?, resulting overall in lower ER? selectivity. Thus, compound 22 (R = Pr) had the highest affinity, while still having good selectivity. On the other hand, branching or further increasing the size of the substituent lowered the selectivity as well as the affinity ( 23 , 24 ). Interestingly, when one of the two carbons of the ethylene unit was di-substituted with small alkyl chains, the ER? selectivity was higher compared to the corresponding mono-substituted analogs ( 36b , 37b vs. 21 , 6 ). It is known that the two ethyl chains of hexestrol 7 and diethylstilbestrol (DES) 8 fit nicely into the 7? and 11? subpockets of the ERs [ 40 ], resulting in high affinity but very low selectivity. In comparison, isobutestrol 6 with just one ethyl chain on the two linking carbons, has lower affinity, but increased ER? selectivity. In this study, we found the same behavior in case of the stilbene analogs: Monoethylstilbestrol 27 had lower affinity than DES, but increased ER? selectivity. The monomethylstilbestrol 26 had even higher selectivity than monoethylstilbestrol 27 , or compound 21 , the saturated analog of 26 . In general, increasing the size of substituents ( 36b , 37b vs 38b , 39b ) or constraining them into a spirocycle ( 38b , 39b vs 42b , 43b ) gave lower selectivities and affinities for both ERs. These lower affinities suggest that these compounds are too large or too rigid to fit well into the LBD pockets of the ERs. The decrease in ER? selectivity is consistent with the larger ligand-binding pocket of ER?, which is being better able to accommodate the large and constrained ligands than ER?. Another trend noted is that the compounds with a carbonyl function on the central ethylene had much lower affinities and selectivities than their reduced analogs ( 29b vs. 21; 30b vs. 6; 32b vs. 36b ).  3.2 Activity in Gene Transcription Eight compounds ( 21 , 22 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 36b , 37b , and 38b ) that showed good selectivity between ER? and ER? in the binding assay were tested for their agonistic character as regulators of gene transcription. They were assayed in a cotransfection assay in human endometrial cancer (HEC-1) cells, using expression plasmids for either ER? or ER? and an estrogen-responsive reporter gene [ 41 ]. The dose-response curves for these compounds are given in Fig. 4 , and the EC50 values are listed in Table 1 . This table also includes the EC50 values for our ER?-selective ligand, DPN 5 , for comparison. All chiral compounds were tested as racemates. To facilitate comparisons of the ER subtype transcriptional potencies of our compounds with their ER subtype binding affinities , the EC50 values from the transcription assays were converted to relative transcriptional potency (RTP) values (See Table 1 , footnote c). The RTPs provide a measure of transcriptional potency relative to that of estradiol and thus can be better compared to their binding affinities, which are also measured relative to estradiol by the competitive radiometric binding assays. Estradiol has a 2.5-fold preference in favor of ER? in terms of binding (Kd [ER?] = 0.2 nM vs. [ER?] = 0.5 nM) and a 5-fold preference in terms of transcriptional potency (EC50 [ER?] = 0.1 nM vs. [ER?] = 0.5 nM). Of the eight compounds tested, seven showed very good potency selectivity for ER? (note RTP ratio) that was either very similar to their RBA ratios (compounds 21 , 25 , 36b , and 38b ) or at least of the same magnitude (compounds 22 , 26 , and 37b ); only compound 27 showed no ER? transcriptional potency preference yet had good ER? binding preference. Thus, our findings show overall a very good concordance of relative binding affinities and relative transcriptional potencies. This was not always the case, however, because affinity represents binding to the ER, whereas potency can also depend on other factors that can depend on the cell and promoter context: The interactions that ER-agonist ligand complexes have with coregulators and promoter elements can vary, depending on the precise conformations of the ER that are induced by binding to ligands of different structure, irrespective of their binding affinity. Compared to our previously prepared ER?-selective ligand, DPN 5 , some of the compounds we present here have higher ER? binding affinity (compounds 6 , 21 , 22 , 24 , 27 , 28 , and 37b ) and comparable or higher ER? binding selectivity (compounds 25 , 26 , 36b , and 37b ) and somewhat less to nearly equivalent ER? transcriptional potency (compounds 21 and 36b ).  5. Experimental Section 5.1 Materials and Methods Reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich and Fisher Scientific; compound 44 was obtained from Aldrich. THF and dichloromethane were dried using a solvent-dispensing system (SDS) (neutral alumina columns) built by J.C. Meyer on the basis of a design developed by Pangborn et al. [ 42 ]. Glassware was oven- or flame-dried, assembled while hot, and cooled under nitrogen atmosphere. All reactions were performed in anhydrous solvents and under nitrogen atmosphere, unless stated otherwise. Reaction progress was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using 0.25 mm Merck silica gel 60 glass plates containing F254 UV-Indicator. The plates were visualized by either UV light (254 nm), or by dipping in a solution of potassium permanganate followed by heating. Column chromatography was performed using Woelm 32–63 ?m silica gel packing. 1H and 13C NMR were recorded on Varian UNITY 400 or 500 MHz spectrometers. NOE experiments were performed with a Varian UNITY INOVIA 500NB instrument. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm and referenced from solvent references. NMR coupling constants are reported in Hertz. Mass spectra were obtained either on a Micromass 70-VSE spectrometer (EI, 70 eV; CI, methane), or a Fisons VG Quattro instrument (ESI, cone voltage 25 V). Melting point (mp) determinations were carried out on Thomas Hoover Unimelt capillary apparatus and are uncorrected.

Cells were harvested 24 h later. Luciferase and ?-galactosidase activity were assayed as described [ 41 ]. All chiral compounds were tested as racemates.  5.1 Materials and Methods Reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich and Fisher Scientific; compound 44 was obtained from Aldrich. THF and dichloromethane were dried using a solvent-dispensing system (SDS) (neutral alumina columns) built by J.C. Meyer on the basis of a design developed by Pangborn et al. [ 42 ]. Glassware was oven- or flame-dried, assembled while hot, and cooled under nitrogen atmosphere. All reactions were performed in anhydrous solvents and under nitrogen atmosphere, unless stated otherwise. Reaction progress was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using 0.25 mm Merck silica gel 60 glass plates containing F254 UV-Indicator. The plates were visualized by either UV light (254 nm), or by dipping in a solution of potassium permanganate followed by heating. Column chromatography was performed using Woelm 32–63 ?m silica gel packing. 1H and 13C NMR were recorded on Varian UNITY 400 or 500 MHz spectrometers. NOE experiments were performed with a Varian UNITY INOVIA 500NB instrument. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm and referenced from solvent references. NMR coupling constants are reported in Hertz. Mass spectra were obtained either on a Micromass 70-VSE spectrometer (EI, 70 eV; CI, methane), or a Fisons VG Quattro instrument (ESI, cone voltage 25 V). Melting point (mp) determinations were carried out on Thomas Hoover Unimelt capillary apparatus and are uncorrected.

C19H22O2 (C, H).  5.3 Estrogen Receptor Binding Affinity Assays Relative binding affinities were determined by a competitive radiometric binding assay as previously described [ 38 , 39 ], using 10 nM [3H]estradiol as tracer (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), and purified full-length human ER? and ER? (PanVera/InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Incubations were for 18–24 h at 0 °C, then the receptor-ligand complexes were absorbed onto hydroxyapatite (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and unbound ligand was washed away. The binding affinities are expressed as relative binding affinity (RBA) values, with the RBA of estradiol set to 100. The values given are the average ± range or SD of two or more independent determinations. All chiral compounds were tested as racemates. Estradiol binds to ER? with a Kd of 0.2 nM and to ER? with a Kd of 0.5 nM.  5.4 Cell Culture and Transient Transfections Human endometrial cancer (HEC-1) cells were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) plus phenol-red supplemented with 5% calf serum and were changed to phenol-red-free Improved MEM and 5% charcoal dextran-treated calf serum (CDCS) for 3–4 days before use in experiments. Transfection assays were performed in 24-well plates using a mixture of 0.35 mL of serum-free improved MEM medium and 0.15 mL of Hank’s balanced salt solution containing 5 ?g of lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), 20 ?g of transferrin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 0.2 ?g of pCMV ?-galactosidase as internal control, 0.5 ?g of 2ERE-pS2-Luc, and 50 ng of ER expression vector per well. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-containing incubator for 6 h. The medium was then replaced with fresh Improved MEM supplemented with 5% CDCS plus the desired concentrations of ligands. Cells were harvested 24 h later. Luciferase and ?-galactosidase activity were assayed as described [ 41 ]. All chiral compounds were tested as racemates.  4. Conclusion By making various analogs of the bibenzyl non-steroidal estrogen isobutestrol and the related stilbenes, we have obtained a number of structurally simple compounds that have high ER? binding affinity and selectivity, and good ER? transcriptional potency and selectivity. In terms of ER? binding affinity, the best bibenzyl is compound 22 and the best stilbene is 27 ; in terms of ER? binding selectivity, the best in each series is 36b and 26 . In terms of ER? transcriptional potency and selectivity, 36b is the best bibenzyl, while among the stilbenes, 27 has the highest potency and 26 is the most selective. Although some of these compounds match the ER? binding selectivity of DPN ( 5 ), none matched or exceeded the ER? transcriptional potency selectivity of this compound. Nevertheless, these compounds represent new structures of remarkable simplicity that have high ER? activities, and they should thus serve as good probes to further investigate the biological functions of ER? in vivo, as well as to study ligand-induced conformations of ER? agonist complexes. It is also remarkable that many of the ER?-selective ligands in this study are ones having non-polar substituents on the central ethylene unit, while previous studies by us and others have validated a pharmacophore model for non-steroidal estrogens having rather more polar substituents on the interior of the ligand. Despite differences in the polarity of the ligand interior, the ER?-selective bibenzyl systems we have studied share with other ER?-selective ligands an interior that is generally more “slender” and/or less “symmetrical” than typical for ER?-selective ligands, such as hexestrol ( 7 ) and DES ( 8 ). These ER?-selective slender ligands appear to have a better fit with the somewhat smaller ligand binding pocket of ER? compared to ER? [ 17 ]. Further structural studies will be needed to elucidate this size/shape preference further, but the results we have obtained here indicate again that the estrogen receptors—both ER? and ER?—have a rather eclectic taste for the refined features of ligand structure, so that even ligands of simple structure can discriminate between the two ER subtypes. Nevertheless, despite our lack of understanding of the detailed features of this discrimination, our findings open new strategies for designing ligands having high selectivity for ER?.
