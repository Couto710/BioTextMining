Replication of the TNFSF4 (OX40L) Promoter Region Association with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus The tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4 gene ( TNFSF4) encodes the OX40 ligand (OX40L), a co-stimulatory molecule involved in T-cell activation. A recent study demonstrated the association of TNFSF4 haplotypes located in the upstream region with risk for- or protection from Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) (Graham et al, 2008). In order to replicate this association, five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging the previously associated haplotypes and passing the proper quality control filters were tested in 1312 cases and 1801 controls from Germany, Italy, Spain, and Argentina. The association of TNFSF4 with SLE was replicated in all the sets except Spain. There was a unique risk haplotype tagged by the minor alleles of the SNPs rs1234317 (pooled OR=1.39, p=0.0009) and rs12039904 (pooled OR=1.38, p=0.0012). We did not observe association to a single protective marker (rs844644) or haplotype as the first study reported; instead, we observed different protective haplotypes, all carrying the major alleles of both SNPs rs1234317 and rs12039904. Association analysis conditioning on the haplotypic background confirmed that these two SNPs explain the entire haplotype effect. This is the first replication study that confirms the association of genetic variation in the upstream region of TNFSF4 with susceptibility to SLE.  Introduction The TNFSF4 gene, is a recent acquisition to the soon long list of non-MHC susceptibility genes associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 1 such as PDCD1, 2 FCGRIIA , 3 ITGAM, 4 , 5 IRF5, 6 - 8 BANK1, 9 STAT4, 10 PTPN22, 11 , 12 and TNFAIP3 . 13 , 14 However, putative genetic associations need to be verified using sufficiently large independent cohorts of patients and controls, in order to confirm true susceptibility genes. TNFSF4 belongs to the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) ligand superfamily of genes and encodes the ligand for OX40 (OX40L, CD252). This receptor-ligand pair is involved in various important regulatory functions associated with lymphocyte activation. OX40L is expressed primarily on antigen presenting cells, including plasmacytoid dendritic cells, whereas OX40 is expressed on CD4+ T cells. 15 OX40L has been found to inhibit the generation of IL-10-producing CD4+ type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1) from naïve and memory T cells, and to strongly inhibit IL-10 production and suppressive function of differentiated Tr1 cells. 16 The recently identified association of TNFSF4 with SLE 1 described a haplotype block in the upstream region of the gene with four SNPs (rs10912580, rs12039904, rs2205960, rs1234317) tagging a unique risk haplotype, and one SNP (rs844644) tagging a protective haplotype. Although no functional variants were identified, correlation with expression of OX40L and CD86 was observed. 1 The present study replicates the genetic association between TNFSF4 polymorphisms and SLE in four independent European SLE sets from Germany, Italy, Spain, and Argentina.  Materials and Methods In this study we analyzed a total of 1312 SLE cases and 1801 controls previously described 7 , 9 comprising 259 SLE cases and 322 healthy controls from Germany, 258 cases and 223 controls from Italy, 517 cases and 901 controls from Spain, and 278 cases and 355 controls from Argentina. All the study subjects had an individual genotyping rate > 90%. The SLE patients fulfilled the ACR revised criteria for the classification of SLE. 31 The study has been approved by the local ethical committees of each participating center. Using Haploview v4.1 on aggressive mode and r2 > 0.8, 32 six tag SNPs were selected from the HapMap-CEU genotype data to capture the common variants (MAF > 5%) across the 80-kb haplotype block previously associated with SLE. 1 Genotyping was preformed using TaqMan® 5? exonuclease pre-developed assays from ABI (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Statistical analysis was performed in Haploview v4.1 32 , PLINK v1.03 17 and StatsDirect v2.4.6. First, quality control filters were applied to remove SNPs with more than 10% of missing data, differential missing rate between cases and controls (p < 0.05), significant deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in controls (p < 0.001), or a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 1%. Allele frequencies of the remaining SNPs (5 of 6) were tested for significant association by a chi square (?2) test within each study population. Pooled odds ratios were estimated by DerSimonian-Laird meta-analysis, including a Breslow-Day test for homogeneity of the odds ratio between strata. Multiple testing was corrected adjusting p-values by false discovery rate (FDR) control. The PLINK’s proxy association function was applied to find flanking markers in strong linkage disequilibrium with the reference SNPs (proxies of all the SNPs typed) and test these proxies for association with disease within a haplotype-based framework. The proxies not genotyped were imputed from multimarker combinations using the HapMap-CEU genotypes as the reference panel. Only imputed SNPs with an INFO value > 0.8 were selected. The data was also analyzed for haplotype associations by both omnibus and haplotype-specific association statistics (T test) as implemented in PLINK. Only haplotypes present in at least 5% of the chromosomes were tested for association. The case/control omnibus test is an H-1 degree of freedom test, for H haplotypes. Conditional tests were used to refine the SNPs and haplotype association signals.  Supplementary Material Supplementary data  Results Single marker analysis Six SNPs were genotyped in the upstream region of TNFSF4 . After frequency and genotyping quality control filters, five markers were tested for differences in allelic frequencies between cases and controls ( Table 1 ). All the markers were strongly associated in the Argentineans and Italians, whereas three markers (rs1234317, rs12039904 and rs844648) displayed only weak association in the Germans, and none reached statistical significance in the Spanish set. In terms of statistical significance (p-value), the SNPs with the strongest effect were: rs1234317 in the Argentine set [OR=1.73(1.36-2.20), p-value=6.23×10?6], rs12039904 in Germans [OR=1.36(1.05-1.77), p-value=2.05×10?2], and rs844644 was the strongest marker with a protective effect [OR=0.64(0.49-0.82), p-value=5.68×10?4] in the Italian set ( Table 1 ). Due to the observed heterogeneity for some markers, the pooled odds ratios estimates were considered under a random effects model (DerSimonian-Laird method) in the meta-analysis. In general, the minor alleles of the SNPs rs1234317 (T) and rs120399904 (T) displayed the most consistent association, as they were associated with an increased risk to develop SLE in 3 of the 4 populations studied and showed the strongest effect size (odds ratio) in the meta-analysis [rs1234317: ORDL=1.39(1.15-1.69), p-value=9×10?4, rs12039904: ORDL=1.38(1.14-1.68), p-value=1.2×10?3]. The Breslow-day test indicated homogeneity of the odds ratio for rs12039904 (p>0.05) and borderline heterogeneity for rs1234317 (p=0.045) ( Table 1 ). The rare A allele of rs844644 previously shown to tag a protective haplotype 1 was associated only in the Italian (p=1.59×10?3) and Argentine sets (5.68×10?4)( Table 1 ). The Breslow-Day test for this marker was significant (p=0.0014) suggesting heterogeneity in the distribution of protective haplotypes. Proxy association In order to refine the SNP’s association signals, we reanalyzed the data in PLINK by the proxy association function on imputation mode. 17 The proxy association test enables the extension of the SNP coverage by imputing non-genotyped SNPs on the basis of patterns of haplotype structure from HapMap, 17 , 18 and may reveal markers with higher association values not detectable otherwise. 17 We successfully imputed five SNPs that were associated in the previous TNFSF4 fine mapping study 1 ( Table S1 ). We observed a similar magnitude of association between the SNPs rs1234317 (genotyped), rs12039904 (genotyped), rs2205960 (imputed) and rs10912580 (imputed) in Argentineans, Germans and Italians ( Table S1 ), which was expected as rs12039904 is highly correlated with rs2205960 (r2=0.90) and rs10912580 (r2=0.95) according to the HapMap-CEU data. The LD between rs1234317 and rs12039904 is high but not enough to be complete proxies of each other (r2=0.64 in HapMap, r2=0.65-0.72 in our cohorts). We did not detect any imputed SNP with an effect stronger than the genotyped markers. Haplotype association After determining the LD structure of the region, and given the overall high correlation between SNPs, we considered a single 5-markers block for subsequent haplotype analyses (rs1234314-rs1234317-rs844644-rs12039904-rs844648) ( Table 2 ). The haplotype omnibus test results displayed a similar association pattern as the single marker results: higher effects in the Argentine (p=8×10?5) and Italian (p=5.8×10?6) cohorts, weak association in the Germans (p=1.86×10?2) and no association in the Spanish group. A unique haplotype ( GTCTA ) was associated with increased risk of disease but, unlike the first association report, 1 different protective haplotypes were observed ( Table 2 ). The A allele of rs844644, previously reported to tag a protective haplotype, 1 was not a consistent finding among the protective haplotypes observed in this study. Instead, the common feature of the protective haplotypes was the background x C x C x, in other words, the presence of the major alleles for the markers rs1234317 (C) and rs12039904 (C) suggesting that they hold the main effects ( Figure 1 ). We examined whether the haplotype block was still associated after controlling for the SNPs rs1234317 and rs12039904 by means of conditional haplotype association test. The omnibus association did not remain significant and therefore we concluded that these two markers explain the complete haplotype effect in our material ( Table S2 ). Conditional tests controlling for each haplotype at a time ( Table S3 ) indicated that only GTCTA and CCCCG are true disease haplotypes, the former associated with risk and the latter with protection.

Discussion This study confirms the genetic association of SLE with a risk haplotype in the TNFSF4 upstream region, in three independent sets of European cases and controls. The lack of association in the Spanish cohort may reflect locus heterogeneity between populations, but could also be affected by the relatively small effect (OR ~1.35) of the TNFSF4 variants on the risk for SLE. A certain degree of heterogeneity between sets might be expected and, even though the Spanish set was the largest in this study, the strength of the genetic association may vary between populations. Genetic associations are more difficult to determine unambiguously at effects with small odds ratios and with larger numbers of individuals needed for confirmation. For example PDCD1, 19 , 20 PTPN22, 21 , 22 or CTLA4 23 - 26 all with odds ratios below 1.40 have displayed inconsistent results in various independent multiethnic sets. The original study describing TNFSF4 also showed inconsistency between the sets used, from the UK and the USA. 1 We observe a risk haplotype including two SNPs in strong LD, although not complete proxies of each other. The SNP contributing to the main effect at TNFSF4 is not known, and by conditional haplotype analysis we demonstrated that rs1234317 and rs12039904 explain the complete haplotypic effect in our dataset. Owing to the high degree of correlation between these SNPs, it can not be determined if they constitute independent effects. Neither rs1234317 nor rs12039904 remained significant when conditioning on the other due to co-linearity between them (data not shown). Thus, additional functional studies are needed to shed light on the true functional variants of TNFSF4 . Contrary to the previous study, we do not identify an independent protective haplotype for TNFSF4 . Instead, the protection is explained by the major alleles of the two most important SNPs contributing to the risk effect. TNFSF4 is located in a previously identified linkage region for SLE in multicase families (1q25). 27 , 28 Although no fine mapping across the region has been performed yet, and other candidates cannot be excluded, it is a plausible candidate gene. In the work by Graham et al . 1 this gene was selected as a biologically feasible candidate and we hereby replicated the association. The haplotypes associated with SLE susceptibility were correlated with an increase in surface expression of OX40L and CD86 and mRNA levels of TNFSF4 . 1 The SNP rs1234317 was found to potentially disrupt a putative binding site for the transcriptional repressor E4BP4 1 , a transcription factor with a role in the interleukin-13-mediated survival of B-cell progenitors. 1 , 29 , 30 Our genetic data supports a role for this SNP. To date no mobility shift assay have been performed to corroborate this bioinformatic finding, and no antibodies are available for E4BP4. Taking all results into account, it is very likely that the region upstream of the TNFSF4 gene presents genomic elements involved in susceptibility to SLE by a mechanism, as yet, completely unknown.  Discussion This study confirms the genetic association of SLE with a risk haplotype in the TNFSF4 upstream region, in three independent sets of European cases and controls. The lack of association in the Spanish cohort may reflect locus heterogeneity between populations, but could also be affected by the relatively small effect (OR ~1.35) of the TNFSF4 variants on the risk for SLE.

TNFSF4 is located in a previously identified linkage region for SLE in multicase families (1q25). 27 , 28 Although no fine mapping across the region has been performed yet, and other candidates cannot be excluded, it is a plausible candidate gene. In the work by Graham et al . 1 this gene was selected as a biologically feasible candidate and we hereby replicated the association. The haplotypes associated with SLE susceptibility were correlated with an increase in surface expression of OX40L and CD86 and mRNA levels of TNFSF4 . 1 The SNP rs1234317 was found to potentially disrupt a putative binding site for the transcriptional repressor E4BP4 1 , a transcription factor with a role in the interleukin-13-mediated survival of B-cell progenitors. 1 , 29 , 30 Our genetic data supports a role for this SNP. To date no mobility shift assay have been performed to corroborate this bioinformatic finding, and no antibodies are available for E4BP4. Taking all results into account, it is very likely that the region upstream of the TNFSF4 gene presents genomic elements involved in susceptibility to SLE by a mechanism, as yet, completely unknown.
