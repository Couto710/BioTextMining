Genome-wide association study identifies five susceptibility loci for glioma To identify risk variants for glioma, we conducted a meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies by genotyping 550K tagging SNPs in a total of 1,878 cases and 3,670 controls, with validation in three additional independent series totaling 2,545 cases and 2,953 controls. We identified five risk loci for glioma at 5p15.33 (rs2736100, TERT ; P = 1.50 × 10?17), 8q24.21 (rs4295627, CCDC26 ; P = 2.34 × 10?18), 9p21.3 (rs4977756, CDKN2A-CDKN2B ; P = 7.24 × 10?15), 20q13.33 (rs6010620, RTEL1 ; P = 2.52 × 10?12) and 11q23.3 (rs498872, PHLDB1 ; P = 1.07 × 10?8). These data show that common low-penetrance susceptibility alleles contribute to the risk of developing glioma and provide insight into disease causation of this primary brain tumor.
