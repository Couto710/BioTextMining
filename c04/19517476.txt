Quality of pathologic response and surgery correlate with survival for completely resected bladder cancer following neoadjuvant chemotherapy BACKGROUND In a retrospective study of SWOG-S8710/INT-0080 (radical cystectomy [RC] alone vs 3 cycles of MVAC neoadjuvant chemotherapy [NC] before RC for bladder cancer), factors associated with improved overall survival (OS) included pathologic complete response (pCR) defined as P0, treatment with NC, completion of RC with negative margins and ?10 pelvic lymph nodes (LNs) removed. METHODS We used stratified Cox regression to retrospectively study the association of quality of pathologic response post-RC with OS in the subset of S8710 patients that received NC and RC with negative margins. RESULTS Of 154 patients who received NC, 68 (44.2%) were <P2 (P0, Pa, P1, or CIS) at RC, 46 (29.9%) were P0, and the remainder had P2+ disease or did not undergo RC. In 115 patients who had RC with negative margins, compared to P0 patients, those with residual Pa, P1 or CIS appeared to have worse OS (p=.054); OS was significantly worse for residual P2+ (p=.0006). LN+ disease was associated with worse OS than LN- (p=.0005). In patients with LN- disease, those with <10 nodes removed appeared to have inferior OS compared to 10+ nodes (p=.079). The combination of pre-NC clinical stage and post-RC pathologic stage was predictive of OS (p<.0001). CONCLUSION NC and RC with negative margins for bladder cancer followed by pathological P0 and LN- disease correlate with improved OS. A combination of baseline clinical stage and post-RC pathologic stage may better predict OS.  INTRODUCTION Neoadjuvant MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) chemotherapy was evaluated for locally advanced bladder cancer (clinical T2 to T4a) treated with radical cystectomy (RC) in a phase III trial (S8710) conducted by SWOG (Southwest Oncology Group) [ 1 ]. A total of 317 patients were randomized to RC or 3 cycles of MVAC followed by RC. The median survival among patients assigned to surgery alone was 46 months compared to 77 months with MVAC (P=0.06). Significantly more patients in the MVAC group had no residual disease (P0) than patients in the cystectomy group (38% vs. 15%, P<0.001). In both groups, improved survival was associated with P0 disease, with 5-year survival for all patients with P0 being an impressive 85%. The International Collaboration of Trialists trial and a meta-analysis have confirmed the value of neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy [ 2 - 4 ]. Retrospective analyses of S8710 revealed that survival was associated with neoadjuvant MVAC, completion of RC and ?10 pelvic lymph nodes (LNs) removed [ 5 , 6 ]. Five year survival was 81% in patients who had neoadjuvant MVAC and RC with ?10 LNs removed (n=66), 66% in patients given RC alone with ?10 LNs removed (n=60), 55% for those given MVAC and RC with <10 LNs removed (N=49), and 39% for those given RC alone with <10 LNs removed (n=44). Pooled across treatment arms, the 5-year survival of patients with positive surgical margins (N=25) and those who did not undergo RC (N=39) was dismal at 0% and 11%, respectively. Therefore, both the quality of surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy appeared to impact favorably and independently on outcomes. pCR (pathologic complete remission) with neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer is also highly correlated with survival. However, the optimal definition of pCR is unsettled [ 7 - 12 ]. When there is no residual invasive cancer in the breast, the number of involved axillary lymph nodes is inversely related to survival. Conversely, patients who convert to node-negative status after treatment have excellent survival, even with residual disease in the breast. There is no evidence that residual in situ carcinoma increases risk of distant relapse [ 13 , 14 ]. In a recent retrospective analysis, residual cancer burden calculated following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer as a continuous index combining primary tumor (size and cellularity) and nodal (number and size) characteristics for prediction of distant relapse-free survival was independently prognostic in a multivariate model [ 15 ]. In another retrospective analysis of women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, risk-stratification of patients was facilitated by the combination of pre-treatment clinical stage and post-therapy pathologic stage [ 16 ]. S8710 defined pCR as the absence of all residual bladder cancer (P0). However, residual non-muscle invasive cancer including CIS (carcinoma in situ), Pa and P1 disease may correlate with outcomes similar to P0 and may differentially impact prognosis compared to P2+ disease. Similar to breast cancer, outcomes following neoadjuvant chemotherapy are likely associated with pre-therapy clinical staging and post-therapy pathologic staging and tumor burden. Therefore, we planned a retrospective study of the S8710 trial to evaluate the correlation of the quality of pathologic response to neoadjuvant MVAC and surgical resection with OS.  METHODS We used stratified Cox regression to retrospectively study the association of quality of pathologic response post-RC with OS in the subset of S8710 patients that received NC and RC with negative margins.  RESULTS Of 154 patients who received NC, 68 (44.2%) were <P2 (P0, Pa, P1, or CIS) at RC, 46 (29.9%) were P0, and the remainder had P2+ disease or did not undergo RC. In 115 patients who had RC with negative margins, compared to P0 patients, those with residual Pa, P1 or CIS appeared to have worse OS (p=.054); OS was significantly worse for residual P2+ (p=.0006). LN+ disease was associated with worse OS than LN- (p=.0005). In patients with LN- disease, those with <10 nodes removed appeared to have inferior OS compared to 10+ nodes (p=.079). The combination of pre-NC clinical stage and post-RC pathologic stage was predictive of OS (p<.0001).  CONCLUSION NC and RC with negative margins for bladder cancer followed by pathological P0 and LN- disease correlate with improved OS. A combination of baseline clinical stage and post-RC pathologic stage may better predict OS.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective cohort study of a prospective trial We retrospectively studied patients in S8710 who received neoadjuvant MVAC chemotherapy and completed RC with negative margins. The primary goals were to determine the association of pathologic response (P0 vs Pa, P1, CIS vs P2+), pathologic lymph node involvement and quality of pelvic lymph node dissection with overall survival (OS). In addition, the correlation of a combination of baseline clinical stage and RC pathological stage with OS was analyzed. Statistical analysis Associations between various pathologic and clinical features in the subset of S8710 patients that received NC and RC with negative margins with overall survival were evaluated using stratified proportional hazards regression. Baseline clinical T stage (T2 vs T3-4), pathologic stage at cystectomy (P0 vs Pa/P1/CIS vs P2+), and number of lymph nodes removed (<10 vs 10+) were explored as potential prognostic factors. Since all patients included in the analysis received RC, Day 0 in these survival models was defined as the date of cystectomy.

RESULTS Quality of pathologic response with neoadjuvant MVAC appears to be a function of baseline stage Of all 154 patients who received neoadjuvant MVAC, 68 (44%) had <P2 disease (P0, Pa, P1, or CIS) at RC, and 46 (30%) had P0 disease. The remainder of patients exhibited residual ?P2 disease or did not undergo RC for a variety of reasons. Among the 62 (40%) with clinical T2 disease at baseline, 34 (55%) and 24 (39%) were <P2 and P0, respectively. Among the 92 (60%) with T3-4 disease, 32 (35%) were <P2 and 22 (24%) were P0. Pathologic stage at cystectomy confers prognostic impact In the 115 of these 154 patients who underwent RC with negative margins, several pathologic features were associated with OS ( Table 1 ). Pathologic response defined as either P0 or <P2 predicted for enhanced OS. The hazard ratio (HR) of OS for >P0 versus P0 was 2.51 (95% CI=1.47, 4.27; p=0.0008), while the HR for P2+ versus <P2 was 2.24 (95% CI=1.34, 3.76; p=0.0022). Compared to P0 patients, those with residual Pa, P1 or CIS appeared to have worse OS ( Figure 1 ), but the difference did not quite achieve statistical significance (HR (95% CI)=2.05 (0.99, 4.24); p=.054), while OS was significantly worse for residual P2+ (HR (95% CI)=2.75 (1.54,4.89); p=.0006). Pathological lymph node (LN) positive disease was associated with worse OS than LN negative disease (HR (95% CI)=2.90 (1.59,5.28); p=.0005) ( Figure 2 ) . The quality of lymph node dissection has prognostic value In patients with LN negative disease, those with <10 nodes removed appeared to have inferior OS compared to 10+ nodes, although this result was not statistically significant (HR (95% CI)=1.66 (0.94,2.90); p=.079) ( Figure 3 ) . The median OS was 7.2 years for <10 LNs removed versus 13.7 years for ? 10 LNs removed. The combination of baseline clinical stage and post-MVAC pathologic stage as a prognostic factor The combination of baseline clinical stage and post-RC pathologic stage (<P2 versus P2+) was prognostic for OS ( Figure 4 ). Among patients with initial T2 disease, P2+ disease post-RC was associated with a >7-fold higher risk of death than <P2 ( Table 1 ).  RESULTS Quality of pathologic response with neoadjuvant MVAC appears to be a function of baseline stage Of all 154 patients who received neoadjuvant MVAC, 68 (44%) had <P2 disease (P0, Pa, P1, or CIS) at RC, and 46 (30%) had P0 disease.

DISCUSSION Among patients who received NC and RC with negative margins for bladder cancer, pathological P0 and LN- disease at RC correlate with improved OS. Compared to P0 patients, those with residual Pa, P1 or CIS appeared to have worse OS, while those with P2+ disease had significantly worse OS. A combination of baseline clinical stage and post-RC pathologic stage may better predict OS. Since positive margins and lack of RC correlated with dismal outcomes in a previous retrospective analysis of all patients enrolled on the S8710 trial, we conducted this analysis only in patients who underwent a complete RC with negative margins [ 5 , 6 ]. Although this retrospective analysis is limited due to the modest number of patients studied, it suggests that residual pathologic stage following neoadjuvant MVAC is associated with post-cystectomy survival in patients that undergo RC with negative margins. Progression-free survival (PFS) could not be analyzed due to the inadequate capture of this endpoint in the prospective trial. Furthermore, due to the very long follow-up time now available on these patients, a large number of non-cancer related deaths may have been captured in this analysis. Therefore, the hazard ratio estimates presented here may represent conservative estimates of the true association between survival and pathologic and clinical stage. Additionally, the original pathology slides and specimens were not available for a more detailed analysis of residual tumor volume. Central pathology review was performed for the initial tumor biopsy, but not for the cystectomy specimen. Among LN negative patients, those with more extensive LN dissection had superior outcomes, although this result was not statistically significant. Similar findings have been reported elsewhere in RC patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy [ 17 ]. The prognostic impact of the number of lymph nodes removed in node positive patients was not analyzed since there were few patients in this category (n=17) and the dismal OS of patients with node positive disease was already known. Patients with lower baseline clinical stage (T2) achieved subsequent major pathologic response (<P2) more often (73%) than those with T3-4 disease (49%). Baseline T2 disease followed by <P2 at RC was associated with the best post-RC survival, whereas those with T2 and subsequent residual muscle-invasive disease (P2+) had the worst outcomes, and may represent patients with chemoresistant disease, although this result is based upon a small subset (N=13) and therefore must be interpreted with caution. Tumor biology is probably the underlying factor driving the chemoresponsiveness in addition to initial clinical stage, but tumor genomics and proteomics could not be evaluated on this study. Since a proportion of patients with T2 disease may attain <P2 residual stage with the initial cystoscopic biopsy or transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT), an independent impact of maximal TURBT on OS may also be occurring in patients receiving MVAC; i.e. all of the benefit may not be attributable to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, urologists should probably still perform an optimal and maximal TURBT in patients with T2 disease that may receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Studies support some breast cancers being generally sensitive to different classes of chemotherapy whereas others may be intrinsically resistant to different classes of chemotherapy [ 18 , 19 ]. This finding in the setting of breast cancer may be applicable to the bladder cancer setting. Our data are hypothesis-generating and with further validation, they may assist in optimally risk-stratifying patients enrolled in future trials of adjuvant therapy with potentially non-cross resistant biologic agents based on pathologic stage of residual disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. While adjuvant chemotherapy has been evaluated for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, definitive data from large randomized trials have not been available [ 20 - 23 ]. Additionally, a recent retrospective study demonstrated that 30% of patients that underwent radical cystectomy suffered from complications within 90 days that could contraindicate adjuvant chemotherapy [ 24 ]. Response to neoadjuvant MVAC may also be predicted by genomic and proteomic analysis of tumor tissue obtained at baseline biopsy. Fourteen genes predicted pCR in a retrospective study of patients with bladder cancer who received neoadjuvant MVAC [ 25 , 26 ]. Among those genes, topoisomerase IIa (target of doxorubicin) was down-regulated in the nonresponder group. Correlation was found between low/intermediate BRCA1 mRNA levels (which mediates DNA repair) and pCR as well as long-term outcomes with neoadjuvant cisplatin-combination chemotherapy for bladder cancer in a retrospective study of 49 patients [ 27 ]. In the setting of neoadjuvant therapy of breast cancer, early modulation of pharmacodynamic biomarkers (e.g. Ki-67) after brief neoadjuvant therapy appears to correlate with long-term clinical outcomes and this paradigm needs to be evaluated in bladder cancer [ 28 , 29 ]. Thus, the neoadjuvant paradigm holds considerable promise to develop tailored therapy for patients with locally advanced bladder cancer. Additionally, this paradigm has the potential to enable the efficient use of resources and accelerate the pace of systemic therapy development due to the availability of pathologic response as an intermediate endpoint.  DISCUSSION Among patients who received NC and RC with negative margins for bladder cancer, pathological P0 and LN- disease at RC correlate with improved OS.
