A systems approach to analysis of molecular complexity in breast cancer In this issue of Clinical Cancer Research , Andre et al. apply high-resolution arrays to elucidate copy number anomalies in breast cancer. They identify a series of genomic regions that may contain oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that contibute to breast carcinogenesis and that serve as potential therapy targets.
