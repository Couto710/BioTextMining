Epidemiology of Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder in the United States [ 1 ]. Symptomatic disease in the knee and hip occurs in approximately 6% and 3%, respectively, of adults 30 years of age or older [ 2 ]. From 1995 to 2005, the number people affected with symptomatic OA has grown from 21 million to nearly 27 million in the United States, probably reflecting the aging of the population and the obesity epidemic [ 3 ]. Pain from OA is a key symptom in the decision to seek medical care and is an important antecedent to disability [ 4 ]. Because of its high prevalence and the frequent disability that accompanies disease in major joints such as the knee and hip, OA accounts for more trouble with climbing stairs and walking than any other disease [ 5 ] and is the most common reason for total hip and total knee replacement [ 6 ]. The rapid increase in the prevalence of this already common disease suggests that OA will have a growing impact on health care and public health systems in the future [ 3 ].
