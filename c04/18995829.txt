Chromatin Recruitment of DNA repair proteins: Lessons from the Fanconi Anemia and Double Strand Break Repair Pathways Summary In response to DNA damage, eukaryotic cells must rapidly load DNA repair proteins onto damaged chromatin. Chromatin recruitment often entails ubiquitination of a damage-specific DNA repair protein, interaction with a ubiquitin binding factor, assembly of a multisubunit DNA repair complex, and eventually a deubiquitination event once the DNA repair reaction has been completed. This review focuses on the recent discoveries in the Fanconi Anemia (FA) and DNA double strand break (DSB) repair pathways which underscore the importance of regulated chromatin loading in the DNA damage response. Interestingly, these two pathways share several features, suggesting a more general mechanism for DNA repair regulation.
