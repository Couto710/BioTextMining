Enhancing therapeutic HPV DNA vaccine potency through depletion of CD4 +CD25 + T regulatory cells Therapeutic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines targeting E6 and/or E7 antigens represent an opportunity to control HPV-associated lesions. We have previously generated several therapeutic DNA vaccines targeting HPV-16 E7 antigen and generated significant antitumor effects. Since regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in suppressing immune responses against tumors by immunotherapy, such as DNA vaccines, we tested if the therapeutic effects of a DNA vaccine encoding E7 linked to heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) can be improved by a strategy to deplete Tregs using a anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (PC61) in vaccinated mice. We found that administration of PC61 prior to vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA was capable of generating higher levels of E7-specific CD8+ T cells compared to the control antibody, leading to significantly improved therapeutic and long-term protective antitumor effects against an E7-expressing tumor, TC-1. Thus, a strategy to deplete CD4+CD25+ Tregs in conjunction with therapeutic tumor antigen-specific DNA vaccine may represent a potentially promising approach to control tumor. The clinical implications of our study are discussed.  2.0 Introduction Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of death by cancer for women worldwide. Close to half a million women are diagnosed each year with cervical cancer and about 2/5ths of these women do not survive [ 1 ]. The primary treatment for cervical cancer is radical hysterectomy and surgical debulking in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Patients with advanced cervical cancer still have a poor prognosis despite undergoing these conventional therapies with significant side effects. Thus, the development of innovative approaches to treatment remains a priority. It is now clear that almost all cervical cancers are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly types 16 and 18. Two HPV oncogenic proteins, E6 and E7, are constantly expressed in cervical cancer and are responsible for the malignant transformation of cervical cancer. Thus, immunotherapy and vaccine development targeting E6 and/or E7 represents a great opportunity to control HPV-associated cervical malignancies. Numerous therapeutic vaccines targeting E6 and/or E7 have been reported in preclinical studies as well as early phases of clinical trials (for review, see [ 2 ]). Antigen-specific immunotherapy using DNA vaccines has emerged as a promising alternative to current therapies for cervical cancer. Naked DNA vaccines are safe, very stable relative to protein vaccines and easy to reproduce (for review, see [ 3 , 4 ]). DNA vaccines are capable of generating tumor antigen-specific immune responses, which may potentially destroy tumors while sparing normal tissues. However, DNA vaccines are limited by a lack of immunogenicity and require additional means to improve their ability to generate strong immune responses. Using a gene gun administration system, it is now possible to directly deliver DNA vaccines to Langerhans cells in the skin, which are immature dendritic cells (DCs). Langerhans cells, once they uptake and express the DNA, will mature and migrate to the draining lymph nodes, where they prime and activate naïve cytotoxic T cells specific for tumor antigen (for review, see [ 5 , 6 ]). We have used this system to develop a number of strategies to enhance DNA vaccine potency by modifying the properties of DCs (for review, see [ 7 , 8 ]). DNA vaccination employing intracellular targeting strategies to improve MHC class I and II presentation of the encoded antigen in DCs represents a potentially effective strategy to improve DNA vaccine potency. This strategy involves linking the tumor antigen to a chaperone protein, which includes members of the heat shock protein (Hsp) family. Hsps bound with antigens are concentrated in DCs and are able to activate other immature DCs [ 9 - 11 ]. We have previously shown that DNA vaccines encoding Hsp70 linked to model antigen, human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 antigen (E7/Hsp70 DNA) significantly increases the expansion and activation of E7-specific CD8+ T cells, resulting in enhanced antitumor immunity against established tumors [ 12 ]. The employment of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (PC61) represents another opportunity to enhance the potency of DNA vaccines because it targets naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ T cells. It has been shown that the administration of PC61 can lead to the depletion of CD4+CD25+ T cells [ 13 ]. T regulatory cells (Tregs) not only influence self-antigen specific immune responses, but also dampen foreign-antigen specific immunity. It has also been suggested that tumor cells secrete cytokines to attract Tregs to the tumor microenvironment (for review, see [ 14 ]). PC61 has been previously used in combination with a tumor cell-based vaccine, and has been shown to enhance the efficacy of the vaccine in treating melanoma tumors [ 15 ]. A comparable strategy has been used by Furuichi et al [ 16 ] and Toka et al [ 17 ] using murine viral infection models. In respect to anti-tumour immunity, studies have demonstrated significant improvement in CTL responses following T reg cell depletion [ 18 ]. Thus, Treg depletion using PC61 represents a potentially promising strategy to improve the potency of DNA vaccines. In the current study, we investigate whether the depletion of CD4+CD25+ Tregs using PC61 would lead to the enhancement of HPV DNA vaccine potency in vaccinated mice. We found that administration of PC61 prior to vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA was capable of generating higher levels of E7-specific CD8+ T cells compared to administration of the isotype control antibody, leading to significantly improved therapeutic and long-term protective antitumor effects against TC-1 tumors. Thus, a strategy to deplete CD4+CD25+ Tregs in conjunction with therapeutic tumor antigen-specific DNA vaccine may represent a potentially promising approach to control tumor. The clinical implications of our study are discussed.  3.0 Materials and Methods 3.1 Animals and tumor cell line Female C57BL/6 mice, 5 to 6 week-old, were purchased from National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD). Animals were used in compliance with institutional animal health care regulations, and all experimental procedures were approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The production and maintenance of TC-1 cells has been described previously [ 19 ]. In brief, the cells were grown in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM nonessential amino acids, and 0.4 mg/ml G418 at 37°C with 5% CO2. On the day of tumor challenge, TC-1 cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with 1X Hanks buffered salt solution, and finally resuspended in 1X Hanks buffered salt solution to the designated concentration for injection. 3.2 Antibodies, peptides and plasmid DNA Constructs Antibodies against mouse CD4 (PE-conjugated, clone L3T4), CD8a (PE-conjugated, clone 53.6.7), IFN-? (FITC-conjugated, clone XMG1.2), CD25 to check depletion (PerCP Cy5.5-conjugated, clone 7D4) and rat isotype-matched immunoglobulin were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Antibodies against CD25 for depletion (FITC-conjugated, clone PC61.5) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Rat anti-mouse CD25 mAbs (PC61) were used as ascites produced by PC61 hybridoma in nu/nu mice and purified by Prosep G Ig purification kit (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The HPV-16 E7 peptide (aa49-57) was synthesized by Macromolecular Resources (Denver, CO) at a purity of ? 70%. The generation of pcDNA3-E7/Hsp70 plasmid construct has been described previously [ 12 ]. 3.3 Depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells with PC61 Two doses of monoclonal antibody PC61 were administered to C57BL/6 mice groups, 500 ?g or 170 ?g / mouse via intraperitoneal injection. As a negative control, rat isotype-matched antibody (isotype control Ab) was administered to C57BL/6 mice via intraperitoneal injection, using a dose of 500 ?g / mouse. Splenocytes were harvested and the cell surfaces were stained using anti-CD4 and anti-CD25 to determine levels of depletion. Persistence of CD4+CD25+ Treg depletion using 170 ?g / mouse of PC61 was then determined using time points day 4 and 14 after antibody injection. Groups of C57BL/6 mice were injected with 170 ?g / mouse of PC61 or isotype Ab as a control. Splenocytes were harvested and stained using anti-CD4 and anti-CD25 to determine levels of depletion at each time point. 3.4 DNA Vaccination following Treg Depletion For the vaccination, DNA-coated gold particles were prepared according to a protocol described previously [ 12 ]. Gold particles coated with the pcDNA3-E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine were delivered to the shaved abdominal regions of mice using a helium-driven gene gun (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with a discharge pressure of 400 lb/in2. Mice were then immunized with 2 ?g / mouse of the DNA vaccine twice with a 1-wk interval. In the experiments using PC61 together with DNA vaccination, C57BL/6 mice were injected with 170 ?g / mouse PC61 4 days prior to DNA vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine. As a negative control, a group of mice were injected with 170 ?g of isotype control Ab. 3.5 Intracellular Staining and Flow Cytometry To check for CD4+CD25+ T cells in the depletion experiments, splenocytes (3×105 /mouse) harvested from the mice were stained using anti-CD4 followed by anti-CD25 clone 7D4. After staining, flow cytometry analysis was performed using FACScalibur with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, Calif.). To check for E7-specific CD8+ T cells, harvested splenocytes (3×105 /mouse) were incubated with 2 ?g/ml of E7 peptide (aa 49–57) containing an H-2 Db-restricted CTL epitope to detect E7-specific CD8+ T-cell precursor responses. Golgistop (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) was added 6 h before harvesting the cells from the culture. Cells were subjected to intracellular cytokine staining by using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Pharmingen). Intracellular gamma interferon (IFN-?) was stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rat anti-mouse IFN-?. Intracellular CD8a was stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal rat anti-mouse CD8a. 3.6 <italic>In Vivo</italic> Long-Term Tumor Protection Experiments C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were administered 170 ?g / mouse of PC61 or isotype control Ab 4 days prior to vaccination twice with a 1-wk interval with E7/Hsp70 DNA. One control group of mice was administered 170 ?g / mouse of PC61 alone. A group of naïve mice used was another control. 53 days after the last vaccination, the mice groups were subjected to tumor challenge with 5×104 /mouse of TC-1 tumor cells in the right flank. Tumor sizes in the mice were monitored and measured every 3-4 days using digital calipers. 3.7 <italic>In Vivo</italic> Tumor Treatment Experiments C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were subjected to tumor inoculation using 5×104 TC-1 tumor cells/mouse in the right flank. Five days after tumor inoculation, groups of tumor-bearing mice were administered 170 ?g / mouse of PC61 via intraperitoneal injection 4 days prior to vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA twice with a 1-wk interval. One group of tumor-bearing mice was administered PC61 alone as a control. A different group of tumor-bearing mice was left without treatment as another control. Tumor sizes in the mice were monitored and measured every 3-4 days using digital calipers. 3.8 Statistical Analysis All data expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD) are representative of at least two different experiments. Comparisons between individual data points for tumor sizes were made using a Student's t -test or repeated measure ANOVA (analysis of variance) test. Differences in survival between experimental groups were analyzed using the Log rank test. Tumor sizes were calculated using the following equation: (tumor length × width × height) / 2. Death of mouse was arbitrarily defined as tumor diameter greater than 2 cm.  3.1 Animals and tumor cell line Female C57BL/6 mice, 5 to 6 week-old, were purchased from National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD).

On the day of tumor challenge, TC-1 cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with 1X Hanks buffered salt solution, and finally resuspended in 1X Hanks buffered salt solution to the designated concentration for injection.  3.2 Antibodies, peptides and plasmid DNA Constructs Antibodies against mouse CD4 (PE-conjugated, clone L3T4), CD8a (PE-conjugated, clone 53.6.7), IFN-? (FITC-conjugated, clone XMG1.2), CD25 to check depletion (PerCP Cy5.5-conjugated, clone 7D4) and rat isotype-matched immunoglobulin were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA).

As a negative control, rat isotype-matched antibody (isotype control Ab) was administered to C57BL/6 mice via intraperitoneal injection, using a dose of 500 ?g / mouse. Splenocytes were harvested and the cell surfaces were stained using anti-CD4 and anti-CD25 to determine levels of depletion. Persistence of CD4+CD25+ Treg depletion using 170 ?g / mouse of PC61 was then determined using time points day 4 and 14 after antibody injection. Groups of C57BL/6 mice were injected with 170 ?g / mouse of PC61 or isotype Ab as a control. Splenocytes were harvested and stained using anti-CD4 and anti-CD25 to determine levels of depletion at each time point.  3.4 DNA Vaccination following Treg Depletion For the vaccination, DNA-coated gold particles were prepared according to a protocol described previously [ 12 ]. Gold particles coated with the pcDNA3-E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine were delivered to the shaved abdominal regions of mice using a helium-driven gene gun (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with a discharge pressure of 400 lb/in2. Mice were then immunized with 2 ?g / mouse of the DNA vaccine twice with a 1-wk interval. In the experiments using PC61 together with DNA vaccination, C57BL/6 mice were injected with 170 ?g / mouse PC61 4 days prior to DNA vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine. As a negative control, a group of mice were injected with 170 ?g of isotype control Ab.  3.5 Intracellular Staining and Flow Cytometry To check for CD4+CD25+ T cells in the depletion experiments, splenocytes (3×105 /mouse) harvested from the mice were stained using anti-CD4 followed by anti-CD25 clone 7D4.

Death of mouse was arbitrarily defined as tumor diameter greater than 2 cm.  4.0 Results 4.1 Administration of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (PC61) leads to depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells in PC61-treated mice In order to determine whether treatment with anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (PC61) would deplete mice of CD4+CD25+ T cells, we performed in vivo experiments using C57BL/6 mice. We administered doses of either 170?g or 500?g/mouse of PC61 via intraperitoneal injection based on previously determined pilot experiments. We also performed a negative control using 500 ?g/mouse of rat isotype-control antibody (isotype Ab). Four days after the injection, splenocytes were harvested and checked for CD4+CD25+ T cells using flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 1A , the percentages of CD4+CD25+ T cells from splenocytes were similar in the mice treated with both the doses of PC61. In comparison, the percentage of CD4+CD25+ T cells from splenocytes in mice treated with isotype Ab was significantly higher. We also compared the depletion in mice treated with 170 ?g/mouse of PC61 at time points 4 and 14 days using isotype Ab as a negative control. As shown in Figure 1B , the percentages of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells from splenocytes in mice treated with 170 ?g/mouse of PC61 were similar on day 4 and 14. Furthermore, the same trend was observed in the negative control. Taken together, our data suggests that the PC61 antibody at the dose of 170 ?g/mouse leads to effective depletion of CD4+CD25+ T cells. 4.2 Depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells with PC61 enhances the E7-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune responses generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA It has been shown that CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells suppress the activation of effector T cells in vitro [ 20 ]. In order to determine if depletion of these CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells in C57BL/6 mice would enhance the activation of E7-specific CD8+ T cells induced by vaccination with pcDNA3-E7/Hsp70 DNA, C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were administered 170?g/mouse of PC61 or isotype control Ab via intraperitoneal injection and 4 days later, vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA intradermally via gene gun twice with 1-week interval as depicted in Figure 2A . A group of naïve mice vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA without antibody treated were used as negative controls. 1 week after the last vaccination, splenocytes were harvested from the different groups and characterized for E7-specific CD8+ T cells using intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 2B and C , mice treated with PC61 and E7/Hsp70 DNA demonstrated significantly greater E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to the mice treated with isotype Ab and E7/Hsp70 DNA or E7/Hsp70 DNA only. Thus, our results indicate that depletion of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells using PC61 enhances the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA in treated mice. 4.3 PC61 enhances the long-term protective antitumor effects generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA To determine if the observed enhancement of E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA by PC61 would translate into long-term tumor protection, we performed in vivo tumor protection experiments using C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were administered 170?g/mouse of PC61 or isotype control Ab via intraperitoneal injection 4 days later, vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA intradermally via gene gun twice with 1-week interval as depicted in Figure 2A . One group of mice was administered PC61 alone and another group of untreated mice was used as a negative control. All groups of mice were challenged with TC-1 tumor cells 53 days after the last vaccination. We observed that all the TC-1 tumor bearing mice showed increased numbers of T regulatory cells in the lymphoid tissues and in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes compared to naïve mice [ 21 , 22 ]. Furthermore, we also found that PC61 injection can result in the depletion of T regulatory cells without significantly changing the composition of CD4 and CD8 effector cells in the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (data not shown). As shown in Figure 3A , the mice treated with PC61 and vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA before tumor challenge exhibited significantly decreased tumor growth compared to vaccinated mice treated with the isotype control Ab (* p =0.017). We further characterized the survival in the different mice groups using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. As shown in Figure 3B , the mice treated with PC61 and vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA before tumor challenge exhibited significantly improved survival compared to vaccinated mice treated with the isotype control Ab (** p =0.039). Taken together, our data indicate that depletion of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells with PC61 can enhance the long-term protective antitumor effects generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA and improve the survival in tumor-challenged mice. 4.4 PC61 enhances the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by treatment of TC-1 tumor-bearing mice with E7/Hsp70 DNA In order to demonstrate whether PC61 can enhance the antitumor effects generated by treatment of tumor-bearing mice with E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine, we performed in vivo tumor treatment experiments. C57BL/6 mice were challenged with 5×104 /mouse of TC-1 tumor cells on day 0. Five days after tumor challenge, mice were administered 170?g/mouse of PC61 or isotype control Ab via intraperitoneal injection then were 4 days later, vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA intradermally via gene gun twice with 1-week interval as depicted in Figure 2A . One group of mice was administered PC61 alone and another group of untreated mice was used as a negative control. As shown in Figure 4A , the tumor-bearing mice treated with PC61 followed by E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine exhibited significantly decreased tumor size compared to the tumor-bearing mice treated with the isotype control Ab followed by E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine (* p =0.127). We further characterized the survival of the different mice groups using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. As shown in Figure 4B , the tumor-bearing mice treated with PC61 followed by E7/Hsp70 DNA exhibited significantly improved survival compared to vaccinated mice treated with the isotype control Ab (** p =0.094). Taken together, our data indicate that PC61 enhances the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by treatment with E7/Hsp70 DNA and prolongs survival in tumor-bearing mice.  4.0 Results 4.1 Administration of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (PC61) leads to depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells in PC61-treated mice In order to determine whether treatment with anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (PC61) would deplete mice of CD4+CD25+ T cells, we performed in vivo experiments using C57BL/6 mice. We administered doses of either 170?g or 500?g/mouse of PC61 via intraperitoneal injection based on previously determined pilot experiments. We also performed a negative control using 500 ?g/mouse of rat isotype-control antibody (isotype Ab). Four days after the injection, splenocytes were harvested and checked for CD4+CD25+ T cells using flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 1A , the percentages of CD4+CD25+ T cells from splenocytes were similar in the mice treated with both the doses of PC61. In comparison, the percentage of CD4+CD25+ T cells from splenocytes in mice treated with isotype Ab was significantly higher. We also compared the depletion in mice treated with 170 ?g/mouse of PC61 at time points 4 and 14 days using isotype Ab as a negative control. As shown in Figure 1B , the percentages of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells from splenocytes in mice treated with 170 ?g/mouse of PC61 were similar on day 4 and 14. Furthermore, the same trend was observed in the negative control. Taken together, our data suggests that the PC61 antibody at the dose of 170 ?g/mouse leads to effective depletion of CD4+CD25+ T cells. 4.2 Depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells with PC61 enhances the E7-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune responses generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA It has been shown that CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells suppress the activation of effector T cells in vitro [ 20 ]. In order to determine if depletion of these CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells in C57BL/6 mice would enhance the activation of E7-specific CD8+ T cells induced by vaccination with pcDNA3-E7/Hsp70 DNA, C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were administered 170?g/mouse of PC61 or isotype control Ab via intraperitoneal injection and 4 days later, vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA intradermally via gene gun twice with 1-week interval as depicted in Figure 2A . A group of naïve mice vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA without antibody treated were used as negative controls. 1 week after the last vaccination, splenocytes were harvested from the different groups and characterized for E7-specific CD8+ T cells using intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 2B and C , mice treated with PC61 and E7/Hsp70 DNA demonstrated significantly greater E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to the mice treated with isotype Ab and E7/Hsp70 DNA or E7/Hsp70 DNA only. Thus, our results indicate that depletion of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells using PC61 enhances the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA in treated mice. 4.3 PC61 enhances the long-term protective antitumor effects generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA To determine if the observed enhancement of E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA by PC61 would translate into long-term tumor protection, we performed in vivo tumor protection experiments using C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were administered 170?g/mouse of PC61 or isotype control Ab via intraperitoneal injection 4 days later, vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA intradermally via gene gun twice with 1-week interval as depicted in Figure 2A .

Taken together, our data indicate that depletion of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells with PC61 can enhance the long-term protective antitumor effects generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA and improve the survival in tumor-challenged mice. 4.4 PC61 enhances the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by treatment of TC-1 tumor-bearing mice with E7/Hsp70 DNA In order to demonstrate whether PC61 can enhance the antitumor effects generated by treatment of tumor-bearing mice with E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine, we performed in vivo tumor treatment experiments. C57BL/6 mice were challenged with 5×104 /mouse of TC-1 tumor cells on day 0. Five days after tumor challenge, mice were administered 170?g/mouse of PC61 or isotype control Ab via intraperitoneal injection then were 4 days later, vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA intradermally via gene gun twice with 1-week interval as depicted in Figure 2A . One group of mice was administered PC61 alone and another group of untreated mice was used as a negative control. As shown in Figure 4A , the tumor-bearing mice treated with PC61 followed by E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine exhibited significantly decreased tumor size compared to the tumor-bearing mice treated with the isotype control Ab followed by E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine (* p =0.127). We further characterized the survival of the different mice groups using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. As shown in Figure 4B , the tumor-bearing mice treated with PC61 followed by E7/Hsp70 DNA exhibited significantly improved survival compared to vaccinated mice treated with the isotype control Ab (** p =0.094). Taken together, our data indicate that PC61 enhances the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by treatment with E7/Hsp70 DNA and prolongs survival in tumor-bearing mice.  4.1 Administration of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (PC61) leads to depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells in PC61-treated mice In order to determine whether treatment with anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (PC61) would deplete mice of CD4+CD25+ T cells, we performed in vivo experiments using C57BL/6 mice. We administered doses of either 170?g or 500?g/mouse of PC61 via intraperitoneal injection based on previously determined pilot experiments. We also performed a negative control using 500 ?g/mouse of rat isotype-control antibody (isotype Ab). Four days after the injection, splenocytes were harvested and checked for CD4+CD25+ T cells using flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 1A , the percentages of CD4+CD25+ T cells from splenocytes were similar in the mice treated with both the doses of PC61. In comparison, the percentage of CD4+CD25+ T cells from splenocytes in mice treated with isotype Ab was significantly higher. We also compared the depletion in mice treated with 170 ?g/mouse of PC61 at time points 4 and 14 days using isotype Ab as a negative control. As shown in Figure 1B , the percentages of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells from splenocytes in mice treated with 170 ?g/mouse of PC61 were similar on day 4 and 14. Furthermore, the same trend was observed in the negative control. Taken together, our data suggests that the PC61 antibody at the dose of 170 ?g/mouse leads to effective depletion of CD4+CD25+ T cells.  4.1 Administration of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (PC61) leads to depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells in PC61-treated mice In order to determine whether treatment with anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (PC61) would deplete mice of CD4+CD25+ T cells, we performed in vivo experiments using C57BL/6 mice. We administered doses of either 170?g or 500?g/mouse of PC61 via intraperitoneal injection based on previously determined pilot experiments. We also performed a negative control using 500 ?g/mouse of rat isotype-control antibody (isotype Ab). Four days after the injection, splenocytes were harvested and checked for CD4+CD25+ T cells using flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 1A , the percentages of CD4+CD25+ T cells from splenocytes were similar in the mice treated with both the doses of PC61. In comparison, the percentage of CD4+CD25+ T cells from splenocytes in mice treated with isotype Ab was significantly higher. We also compared the depletion in mice treated with 170 ?g/mouse of PC61 at time points 4 and 14 days using isotype Ab as a negative control. As shown in Figure 1B , the percentages of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells from splenocytes in mice treated with 170 ?g/mouse of PC61 were similar on day 4 and 14. Furthermore, the same trend was observed in the negative control. Taken together, our data suggests that the PC61 antibody at the dose of 170 ?g/mouse leads to effective depletion of CD4+CD25+ T cells.  4.2 Depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells with PC61 enhances the E7-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune responses generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA It has been shown that CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells suppress the activation of effector T cells in vitro [ 20 ]. In order to determine if depletion of these CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells in C57BL/6 mice would enhance the activation of E7-specific CD8+ T cells induced by vaccination with pcDNA3-E7/Hsp70 DNA, C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were administered 170?g/mouse of PC61 or isotype control Ab via intraperitoneal injection and 4 days later, vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA intradermally via gene gun twice with 1-week interval as depicted in Figure 2A . A group of naïve mice vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA without antibody treated were used as negative controls. 1 week after the last vaccination, splenocytes were harvested from the different groups and characterized for E7-specific CD8+ T cells using intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 2B and C , mice treated with PC61 and E7/Hsp70 DNA demonstrated significantly greater E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to the mice treated with isotype Ab and E7/Hsp70 DNA or E7/Hsp70 DNA only. Thus, our results indicate that depletion of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells using PC61 enhances the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA in treated mice.  4.2 Depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells with PC61 enhances the E7-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune responses generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA It has been shown that CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells suppress the activation of effector T cells in vitro [ 20 ]. In order to determine if depletion of these CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells in C57BL/6 mice would enhance the activation of E7-specific CD8+ T cells induced by vaccination with pcDNA3-E7/Hsp70 DNA, C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were administered 170?g/mouse of PC61 or isotype control Ab via intraperitoneal injection and 4 days later, vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA intradermally via gene gun twice with 1-week interval as depicted in Figure 2A . A group of naïve mice vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA without antibody treated were used as negative controls. 1 week after the last vaccination, splenocytes were harvested from the different groups and characterized for E7-specific CD8+ T cells using intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 2B and C , mice treated with PC61 and E7/Hsp70 DNA demonstrated significantly greater E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to the mice treated with isotype Ab and E7/Hsp70 DNA or E7/Hsp70 DNA only. Thus, our results indicate that depletion of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells using PC61 enhances the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA in treated mice.  4.3 PC61 enhances the long-term protective antitumor effects generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA To determine if the observed enhancement of E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA by PC61 would translate into long-term tumor protection, we performed in vivo tumor protection experiments using C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were administered 170?g/mouse of PC61 or isotype control Ab via intraperitoneal injection 4 days later, vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA intradermally via gene gun twice with 1-week interval as depicted in Figure 2A . One group of mice was administered PC61 alone and another group of untreated mice was used as a negative control. All groups of mice were challenged with TC-1 tumor cells 53 days after the last vaccination. We observed that all the TC-1 tumor bearing mice showed increased numbers of T regulatory cells in the lymphoid tissues and in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes compared to naïve mice [ 21 , 22 ]. Furthermore, we also found that PC61 injection can result in the depletion of T regulatory cells without significantly changing the composition of CD4 and CD8 effector cells in the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (data not shown). As shown in Figure 3A , the mice treated with PC61 and vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA before tumor challenge exhibited significantly decreased tumor growth compared to vaccinated mice treated with the isotype control Ab (* p =0.017). We further characterized the survival in the different mice groups using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. As shown in Figure 3B , the mice treated with PC61 and vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA before tumor challenge exhibited significantly improved survival compared to vaccinated mice treated with the isotype control Ab (** p =0.039). Taken together, our data indicate that depletion of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells with PC61 can enhance the long-term protective antitumor effects generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA and improve the survival in tumor-challenged mice.  4.3 PC61 enhances the long-term protective antitumor effects generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA To determine if the observed enhancement of E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA by PC61 would translate into long-term tumor protection, we performed in vivo tumor protection experiments using C57BL/6 mice.

As shown in Figure 3B , the mice treated with PC61 and vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA before tumor challenge exhibited significantly improved survival compared to vaccinated mice treated with the isotype control Ab (** p =0.039). Taken together, our data indicate that depletion of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells with PC61 can enhance the long-term protective antitumor effects generated by vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA and improve the survival in tumor-challenged mice.  4.4 PC61 enhances the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by treatment of TC-1 tumor-bearing mice with E7/Hsp70 DNA In order to demonstrate whether PC61 can enhance the antitumor effects generated by treatment of tumor-bearing mice with E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine, we performed in vivo tumor treatment experiments. C57BL/6 mice were challenged with 5×104 /mouse of TC-1 tumor cells on day 0. Five days after tumor challenge, mice were administered 170?g/mouse of PC61 or isotype control Ab via intraperitoneal injection then were 4 days later, vaccinated with E7/Hsp70 DNA intradermally via gene gun twice with 1-week interval as depicted in Figure 2A . One group of mice was administered PC61 alone and another group of untreated mice was used as a negative control. As shown in Figure 4A , the tumor-bearing mice treated with PC61 followed by E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine exhibited significantly decreased tumor size compared to the tumor-bearing mice treated with the isotype control Ab followed by E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine (* p =0.127). We further characterized the survival of the different mice groups using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. As shown in Figure 4B , the tumor-bearing mice treated with PC61 followed by E7/Hsp70 DNA exhibited significantly improved survival compared to vaccinated mice treated with the isotype control Ab (** p =0.094). Taken together, our data indicate that PC61 enhances the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by treatment with E7/Hsp70 DNA and prolongs survival in tumor-bearing mice.  4.4 PC61 enhances the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by treatment of TC-1 tumor-bearing mice with E7/Hsp70 DNA In order to demonstrate whether PC61 can enhance the antitumor effects generated by treatment of tumor-bearing mice with E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine, we performed in vivo tumor treatment experiments. C57BL/6 mice were challenged with 5×104 /mouse of TC-1 tumor cells on day 0.

One group of mice was administered PC61 alone and another group of untreated mice was used as a negative control. As shown in Figure 4A , the tumor-bearing mice treated with PC61 followed by E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine exhibited significantly decreased tumor size compared to the tumor-bearing mice treated with the isotype control Ab followed by E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine (* p =0.127). We further characterized the survival of the different mice groups using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. As shown in Figure 4B , the tumor-bearing mice treated with PC61 followed by E7/Hsp70 DNA exhibited significantly improved survival compared to vaccinated mice treated with the isotype control Ab (** p =0.094). Taken together, our data indicate that PC61 enhances the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by treatment with E7/Hsp70 DNA and prolongs survival in tumor-bearing mice.  5.0 Discussion In the current study, we demonstrate the efficient depletion of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells using the anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody PC61. Furthermore, we showed that administration of PC61 prior to vaccination with E7/Hsp70 DNA generated significantly higher levels of E7-specific CD8+ T cells compared to administration of isotype Ab with DNA vaccination. In addition, treatment with PC61 before DNA vaccination led to significantly greater long-term protective and therapeutic antitumor effects against TC-1 tumor challenge compared to vaccination alone. Thus, combining a strategy to reduce the levels of Tregs utilizing PC61 with an intracellular targeting strategy utilizing E7/Hsp70 DNA vaccine represents an effective approach to improve the potency of therapeutic HPV DNA vaccines. Increasing evidence suggests that it is important to modify the tumor microenvironment in order to improve effectiveness of immunotherapy (for review see [ 23 ]). Studies have shown that tumors secrete the chemokine CCL22, which is chemotactic for CD4+ CD25+ T regulatory cells, which may recruit the Tregs to the tumor microenvironment to suppress cytotoxic activity of effector T cells [ 24 , 25 ]. Furthermore, it has been recently suggested that immunosuppression via CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell recruitment is one of the major evasion mechanisms of tumors (for review, see [ 14 ]) and a key obstacle to successful cancer immunotherapy [ 26 - 28 ]. Therefore, curtailing the influence of immune suppressor cells such as CD4+CD25+ Tregs is an important approach to improving the potency of HPV DNA vaccines. An important limitation in the depletion of Tregs using PC61 Ab is lack of specificity for functionally suppressive CD4+ T cells. Activated CD4+ T cells have also been shown to express CD25, however the level of CD25 is significantly lower in these cells (for reviews on CD4+CD25+ T cells, see [ 27 , 29 ]). In addition to using CD25 to identify CD4+CD25+ T cells, it may be of interest to utilize other markers for these cells. Nuclear transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) has been heavily associated with Tregs since it is required for the development of natural Tregs [ 30 - 32 ] and in many cases has been used for the identification for Tregs [ 33 ]. However, it has been found that not all CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells have regulatory function and some FOXP3 negative T cells are also suppressive in nature [ 30 , 34 ]. It has been recently proposed that low levels of phosphodiesterase 3B can be used to identify natural CD4+CD25+ Tregs [ 34 ]. Thus, further investigation into functional markers for CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells will allow us to improve methods for specific targeting of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells, which may further enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapeutic strategies. In summary, combining a strategy to deplete Tregs with PC61 Ab with a therapeutic HPV DNA vaccine represents a potentially promising approach for the control of HPV-associated lesions. Our strategies to deplete T regulatory cells include the employment of cimetidine [ 35 ], sunitinib [ 36 ], cyclophosphamide [ 37 ] and several other chemotherapeutic agents. For example, cimetidine has been recently shown to enhance immune response of DNA vaccination by impairing the regulatory function of Tregs [ 35 ]. Thus, it will be important to identify the best approach for specific depletion of T regulatory cells for future clinical translation.  5.0 Discussion In the current study, we demonstrate the efficient depletion of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells using the anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody PC61.
