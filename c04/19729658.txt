Activation of the PI3K Pathway in Cancer through Inhibition of PTEN by Exchange Factor P-REX2a Summary PTEN (Phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome ten) is a tumor suppressor whose cellular regulation remains incompletely understood. We identified Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate RAC Exchanger 2a (P-REX2a) as a PTEN-interacting protein. P-REX2a mRNA was more abundant in cancer, and significantly increased in tumors with wild type PTEN that expressed an activated mutant of PIK3CA encoding the p110 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-? (PI3K?). P-REX2a inhibited PTEN lipid phosphatase activity and stimulated the PI3K pathway only in the presence of PTEN. P-REX2a stimulated cell growth and cooperated with a PIK3CA mutant to promote growth factor-independent proliferation and transformation. Depletion of P-REX2a reduced amounts of phosphorylated AKT and growth in cell lines with intact PTEN. Thus P-REX2a is a component of the PI3K pathway that can antagonize PTEN in cancer cells.
