Digoxin and Reduction of Heart Failure Hospitalization in Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Heart Failure In the Digitalis Investigation Group trial, digoxin-associated reduction in the combined end point of heart failure (HF) hospitalization or HF mortality was significant in systolic but not in diastolic HF. To assess whether this apparent disparity can be explained by differences in baseline characteristics and sample size, we used propensity score matching to assemble a cohort of 916 pairs of systolic and diastolic HF patients who were balanced in all measured baseline covariates. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the effect of digoxin on outcomes separately in systolic and diastolic HF, at 2 years (protocol pre-specified) and at the end of 3.2 years of median follow up. HF hospitalization or HF mortality occurred in 28% and 32% of systolic (HR when digoxin was compared with placebo =0.85, 95% CI =0.67 to 1.08, p =0.188), and 20% and 25% of diastolic (HR =0.79, 95% CI =0.60 to 1.03, p =0.085) HF patients respectively receiving digoxin and placebo. At 2 years, HR for this combined end point were similar for systolic (0.72, 95% CI =0.55 to 0.95, p =0.022) and diastolic (0.69, 95% CI =0.50 to 0.95, p =0.025) HF. Digoxin also reduced 2-year HF hospitalization in both systolic (HR =0.73, 95% CI =0.54 to 0.97, p =0.033) and diastolic (HR =0.64, 95% CI =0.45 to 0.90, p =0.010) HF. In conclusion, as in systolic HF, digoxin was equally effective in diastolic HF, who constitutes half of all patients with HF, yet has few evidence-based therapeutic options.  Methods We used a public-use copy of the DIG dataset obtained from the NHLBI. The rationale, design, and results of the DIG trial have been previously reported. 5 Briefly, 7788 chronic HF patients in normal sinus rhythm were randomized to receive digoxin or placebo. These patients were recruited from 302 clinical centers in the US (186) and Canada (116) between 1991 and 1993. Patients with LVEF ?45% (n = 6800) were enrolled in the main trial and those with LVEF >45% (n = 988) were enrolled in the ancillary trial. Patients received 4 different daily doses of digoxin or matching placebo (0.125, 0.25, 0.375, and 0.5 mg). 5 Most patients were receiving diuretics (>80%) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (>90%). Our main outcome was the combined end point of HF hospitalization or HF mortality because it was the primary outcome of the DIG ancillary trial and was used as the basis of US Food and Drug Administration approval of digoxin. Since this combined end point was primarily driven by a reduction in HF hospitalization, we also examined that outcome separately. We analyzed the effect of digoxin on these outcomes both at study end and at 2 years of follow up. The 2-year analysis was pre-specified in the DIG protocol and was also the basis of FDA approval. 10 , 11 Outcomes data were classified by DIG investigators who were blinded to the patient’s study-drug assignment and were 98.9% complete. 12 To ensure that the effect of digoxin in systolic and diastolic HF patients would not be in part due to differences in baseline characteristics between these 2 groups, we assembled a propensity-matched population in which 916 pairs of systolic and diastolic HF patients were balanced in all measured baseline covariates. We calculated propensity scores for diastolic HF for each patient using a non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model adjusting for all measured baseline covariates displayed in Figure 1 . 13 , 14 Absolute standardized differences of <10% for all measured covariates suggested inconsequential post-match imbalance. 13 , 15 , 16 Kaplan-Meier cumulative plots for digoxin and placebo were constructed and compared using log-rank statistics, separately for systolic and diastolic HF. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to compare the effects of digoxin on both outcomes. To determine if the effect of digoxin persisted despite baseline differences, we repeated our analyses in a cohort of 988 systolic HF patients, randomly selected from the 6800 patients in the main trial. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis, with 2-sided values of p <0.05 considered significant, using SPSS 15 for Windows. 17  Results Imbalances in baseline characteristics between patients with systolic and diastolic HF in the original dataset, and balance achieved after propensity matching are displayed in Figure 1 . Baseline patient characteristics between patients receiving digoxin and placebo for matched systolic and diastolic HF patients are displayed in Table 1 . The effect of digoxin on the combined end point of HF hospitalization or HF mortality was similar among systolic (hazard ratio {HR} = 0.85, 95% confidence interval {CI} = 0.67 to 1.08, p = 0.188) and diastolic (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.60 to 1.03, p = 0.085) HF ( Table 2 and Figure 2a ). There was no significant interaction between digoxin and LVEF, regardless whether it was used as a categorical (using a 45% cut-off; p = 0.655) or a continuous variable (p = 0.991). The effect of digoxin on HF hospitalization was also similar in both systolic (HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.62–1.03, p = 0.079) and diastolic (HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.03, p = 0.074) HF ( Table 2 and Figure 2b ), also without any interaction. At the end of 2 years of follow up, the effect of digoxin on the combined end point was similar among systolic (0.72, 95% CI = 0.55 to 0.95, p = 0.022) and diastolic (0.69, 95% CI = 0.50 to 0.95, p = 0.025) HF and digoxin also reduced HF hospitalization in both systolic (0.73, 95% CI = 0.54 to 0.97, p = 0.033) and diastolic (0.64, 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.90, p = 0.010) HF ( Table 3 ). Among a random subset of systolic HF patients (n=988), digoxin use was associated with non-significant reduction in the combined end points (HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.70–1.06, p = 0.158) and HF hospitalization (HR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.65–1.01, p = 0.059). These associations were similar to those observed in diastolic HF (n=988) in the DIG ancillary trial ( Table 2 ). 6  Results Imbalances in baseline characteristics between patients with systolic and diastolic HF in the original dataset, and balance achieved after propensity matching are displayed in Figure 1 . Baseline patient characteristics between patients receiving digoxin and placebo for matched systolic and diastolic HF patients are displayed in Table 1 . The effect of digoxin on the combined end point of HF hospitalization or HF mortality was similar among systolic (hazard ratio {HR} = 0.85, 95% confidence interval {CI} = 0.67 to 1.08, p = 0.188) and diastolic (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.60 to 1.03, p = 0.085) HF ( Table 2 and Figure 2a ).

Among a random subset of systolic HF patients (n=988), digoxin use was associated with non-significant reduction in the combined end points (HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.70–1.06, p = 0.158) and HF hospitalization (HR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.65–1.01, p = 0.059). These associations were similar to those observed in diastolic HF (n=988) in the DIG ancillary trial ( Table 2 ). 6  Discussion Findings from the present analysis demonstrate that digoxin use was associated with a significant reduction in HF hospitalization during the first 2 years of follow-up and a near-significant reduction at the study end in both systolic and diastolic HF patients. These findings are important as patients with diastolic HF are as likely as systolic HF patients to be hospitalized and yet there are few evidence-based recommendations for these patients. Moreover, nearly half of all HF patients have diastolic HF and this number is expected to increase in the coming decades with the aging of the population. 1 There were 2 distinct differences between systolic and diastolic HF patients in the DIG trial. The sample size of patients with diastolic HF was approximately 7 times smaller (988 versus 6800) and despite their older age, they had better survival profiles than systolic HF patients. Treatment effect is generally more pronounced in subgroups of patients with higher burden of disease severity and poorer outcomes. 18 However, when we examined the effect of digoxin in a random subset of 988 systolic HF patients, who had different baseline characteristics than those with diastolic HF ( Figure 1 , pre-match), we found similar results suggesting that the lack of a significant effect of digoxin in diastolic HF in the DIG trial was more likely a function of sample size, and is less likely due to differences in baseline patient characteristics between systolic and diastolic HF patients. Our finding of a similar effect of digoxin in systolic and diastolic HF patients is mechanistically plausible. The neurohormonal activation is a common pathophysiological pathway in both systolic and diastolic HF that may contribute to disease progression. Growing evidence points to neurohormonal antagonism as a more probable mechanism of action of digoxin in HF than its cardiac positive inotropic effect. Digitalis has been shown to reduce the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by inhibiting the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme respectively in vagal afferent fibers and the kidneys. 1 The beneficial effect of digoxin lost statistical significance after the first 2 years of follow up, and more importantly, the effect of digoxin was not harmful in later years. This diminished late effect may be due to cross-over in later years and the use of higher doses of digoxin in the DIG trial, as evidenced from later post-hoc analyses, which may have resulted in higher cumulative digoxin serum concentrations in later years and elimination of earlier benefits. 11 , 19 Low-dose digoxin is a strong independent predictor of low serum digoxin concentrations, which have been shown to reduce mortality. 11 Evidence on the treatment of diastolic HF remains scarce. The effect of candesartan on HF hospitalization in diastolic HF was very similar to the effect of digoxin in the ancillary DIG trial. 7 , 9 However, digoxin has fewer side effects and is less expensive, an important consideration for patients in the developing nations. 7 Perindopril was among the few other drugs tested in diastolic HF and it had no effect on the primary outcome of all-cause death or unplanned HF hospitalization. 20 Currently, irbesartan and aldosterone are being studied in diastolic HF in 2 separate large randomized clinical trials. 21 , 22 A key limitation of the current analysis is the use of smaller sample size of systolic HF that resulted in non-significant effect of digoxin on the combined end point. However, the magnitude of the effect was similar to that observed in the main trial. Yet, findings from the current analysis demonstrate that digoxin may be effective in reducing HF hospitalization in both systolic and diastolic HF. These findings are relevant to contemporary diastolic HF patients as since the DIG trial no new drug has been shown to be effective in these patients. Digoxin in low dosages should be used in systolic HF patients with or without atrial fibrillation who remain symptomatic despite therapy with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and approved beta-blockers, especially in those who cannot afford or tolerate these drugs. In patients with diastolic HF, digoxin should be prescribed to reduce symptoms and hospitalizations. Digoxin may also be helpful in controlling heart rate for those with atrial fibrillation which is more prevalent in diastolic HF. 23  Discussion Findings from the present analysis demonstrate that digoxin use was associated with a significant reduction in HF hospitalization during the first 2 years of follow-up and a near-significant reduction at the study end in both systolic and diastolic HF patients.
