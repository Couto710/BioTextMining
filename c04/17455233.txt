Nuclear Structure as a Source of Cancer Specific Biomarkers Nuclear Microenvironments in Cancer Series There are few biomarkers that have been developed which have proven clinical utility for the detection and prognosis of cancer. Cancer is diagnosed today, in large part, by examining cells under the microscope and determining the shape and texture of the nucleus. The molecular underpinnings of this hallmark of cancer are the components of the nuclear matrix. Utilizing proteomics focused on this subset of proteins, biomarkers have been identified that are specific for cancer types including prostate, colon and bladder cancer. These cancer biomarkers now serve as the basis of assays which can specifically identify individuals with cancer by sampling their blood and/or urine. In addition, these may serve as potential therapeutic targeting or imaging approaches.  CONCLUSIONS As described in the examples above, the initial concept of utilizing changes in nuclear structure as cancer specific biomarkers has been substantiated. For a number of cancer types, clinically useful assays have been produced which focus on these nuclear structure changes. These nuclear structure changes provide specific alterations associated with cancer that may be the molecular correlates of what the pathologist is observing under the microscope. In fact, these may represent some of the few documented changes which are specifically associated with cancer. In addition, these changes may be playing an active role in the cancer process by contributing too many of the nuclear changes which are observed in the functionality of a cancer cell. Nuclear matrix changes appear to be a rich source for potential cancer biomarkers, and may, indeed, reveal important cellular clues about the cancer process. These markers may also provide targeting systems for therapeutic agents as well as revealing processes which may be able to be explored for therapeutic means.
