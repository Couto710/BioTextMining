Sexually dimorphic effects of four genes (COMT, SLC6A2, MAOA, SLC6A4) in genetic associations of ADHD: A preliminary study A growing body of literature finds gender differences in ADHD. However, little is known about the causes of these differences. One possibility is that ADHD risk genes have sexually dimorphic effects. We have investigated four ADHD candidate genes (COMT, SLC6A2, MAOA, SLC6A4) for which there is evidence of sexually dimorphic effects. Past neurobiological and genetic studies suggest that COMT, and SLC6A4 variants may have a greater influence on males and that SLC6A2, and MAOA variants may have a greater influence on females. Our results indicate that genetic associations are stronger when stratified by sex and in the same direction as the previous neurobiological studies indicate: associations were stronger in males for COMT, SLC6A4 and stronger in females for SLC6A2, MAOA. Moreover, we found a statistically signficant gender effect in the case of COMT (P=0.007) when we pooled our work with a prior study. In conclusion, we have found some evidence suggesting that the genetic association for these genes with ADHD may be influenced by the sex of the affected individual. Although our results are not fully validated yet, they should motivate further investigation of gender effects in ADHD genetic association studies.  Materials and Methods Participants The current analyses are derived from family studies of ADHD and bipolar disorder being conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Subjects from our case-control family studies of boys and girls with ADHD ( Biederman and others 1992 ; Biederman and others 1999 ) were referred from psychiatric and pediatric sources. Psychiatric probands were selected from consecutive referrals to a pediatric psychopharmacology program. This site is not a tertiary care clinic, since approximately 50% of new patients have never been diagnosed or treated before. Pediatrically-referred probands with ADHD came from a large Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) in the Boston area. For these studies, screening and recruitment occurred prior to the publication of DSM-IV; thus, initial affection status for individuals and their relatives was based on DSM-IIIR criteria; however lifetime DSM-IV criteria was asked at follow up interviews. During the screening phase, mothers were administered a telephone questionnaire containing criteria for DSM-IIIR ADHD and exclusionary criteria for their referred child. Potential probands were excluded if they were adopted, if their nuclear family was not available for study or if they had major sensori-motor handicaps, psychosis, autism or a Full Scale IQ less than 70. Individuals who screened positive for DSM-IIIR ADHD were invited to enroll in the study along with their first-degree relatives. Referrals with subthreshold ADHD diagnoses were excluded. Study procedures were reviewed with all subjects, and participants were informed that they could withdraw at any time. Individuals 18 years of age or older provided written informed consent for themselves. Mothers provided written informed consent for minor children, and children provided written assent. Those classified as having ADHD at both the screen and the interview (described below) were included as index cases. Additional sibling pairs with ADHD were ascertained from a family study of adults with ADHD ( Faraone and others 2006a ; Faraone and others 2006b ), an affected sibling pair linkage study of ADHD and family studies of bipolar disorder. The screening methods for these studies were similar to the methods for the family studies of ADHD boys and girls with the following exceptions: 1) ADHD cases were only obtained from the psychiatry clinics at MGH (and for the linkage study, the child psychiatry clinic at Children’s Hospital in Boston) as well as advertisements and referrals from individual child psychiatrists in the community; 2) ascertainment was based on DSM-IV diagnoses; 3) the pediatric bipolar studies screened cases for bipolar disorder and did not use psychosis as a rule-out. For subjects coming from these studies, affection status was based on DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. The final data set used in this study consisted of 474 ADHD affected offspring. Of those, 266 were probands and the remaining 208 were siblings who had ADHD. DNA was available for both parents in all families (100%). The age for the ADHD patients at the time of assessment ranged from 2 to 39 years. 361 patients were children and 83 patients were adults at the time of assessment. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample are indicated in Table 1 . Psychiatric Interviews Diagnoses of probands and siblings 12 years of age and older were obtained from independent interviews with them and their mothers using the Schedule for Affective Disorders – Epidemiologic Version for children (Kiddie SADS-E); ( Orvaschel and Puig-Antich 1987 ) which, for all studies except the family studies of girls and boys with ADHD, was adapted to include DSM-IV criteria. For children younger than 12, diagnostic information on these subjects came from parent interviews only. Interviewers were unaware of the proband’s diagnosis. Diagnostic assessments of parents and siblings older than 18 years were based on direct interviews using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM III-R (SCID; ( Spitzer and others 1990 ) also adapted to include DSM-IV criteria in the relevant studies. Interviewers had undergraduate degrees in psychology and were trained to high levels of inter-rater reliability. Diagnoses were scored as positive if all DSM criteria were unequivocally met, with a subthreshold diagnosis assigned to individuals meeting over two thirds of the symptoms of the condition (i.e. ? 6 DSM-IIIR symptoms or ?4 DSM-IV symptoms of either inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity and cross-situationality) and at least a moderate level of impairment. For children older than 12, diagnoses were based on combined data from child and parent interviews, by considering a diagnosis positive if criteria were met in either interview. Diagnostic uncertainties were resolved by a committee of board-certified child psychiatrists and psychologists who were unaware of the subject’s ascertainment group and all data collected from family members. Selection of Genetic Markers We genotyped tag SNPs which covers most of the common SNPs (minimum r2 >0.8) across COMT (10 SNPs), SLC6A2 (24 SNPs), MAOA (11 SNPs) and SLC6A4 (7 SNPs) genes as described previously ( Kim and others 2007 ). However, for our analysis, we chose only one SNP per gene in order to avoid the burden of multiple testing. We chose the SNP with the lowest p-value for each gene ( Figure 1 ) and tested them for gender effects in the full sample. After this analysis, we performed a post-hoc exploratory analysis for all of the tag SNPs in each gene to see if other loci produced stronger association signals. Genotyping The genotyping for SNPs was performed using a multiple base extension reaction with allele discrimination by MassArray mass spectrometry system (Bruker-Sequenom) as previously described ( Sklar and others 2002 ). A number of quality control measures were implemented to ensure the accuracy of the data collected. Genotypes from intra- and inter-plate controls were compared for accuracy, and negative test controls were confirmed to have no genotypes called. In addition, assays that failed in over 10% of the samples were excluded and samples that failed in over 10% of the assays were excluded. SNPs with a Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium p-value less than 0.001 were excluded from analysis. Families with Mendel error rates greater than 5% and SNPs with Mendel error rates greater than 1% were excluded. Statistical Analysis The pedigree data were screened for genotype inconsistencies by using PLINK ( http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/ ) (Purcell and others In press). PLINK was also used to assess genotype distributions for departures from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. The TDTPHASE program of the UNPHASED set ( Dudbridge 2003 ) was used for TDT analysis of transmission to each sex. We also tested whether there was a statistically significant difference between the transmissions to males vs. transmissions to females (gender effect) for each gene using a standard chi-square test with 1 degree of freedom. To examine the overall effect of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism in two independent samples including our families and another case-control study ( Qian and others 2003 ), we converted each chi-square value to z scores, using the formula (?2-n)/? 2n, where n is the degrees of freedom for the chi square value. The combined z score was obtained using the inverse normal method by adding the two z scores and then dividing the sum by ?2 ( Hedges and Olkin 1985 ).  Participants The current analyses are derived from family studies of ADHD and bipolar disorder being conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Subjects from our case-control family studies of boys and girls with ADHD ( Biederman and others 1992 ; Biederman and others 1999 ) were referred from psychiatric and pediatric sources.

Selection of Genetic Markers We genotyped tag SNPs which covers most of the common SNPs (minimum r2 >0.8) across COMT (10 SNPs), SLC6A2 (24 SNPs), MAOA (11 SNPs) and SLC6A4 (7 SNPs) genes as described previously ( Kim and others 2007 ). However, for our analysis, we chose only one SNP per gene in order to avoid the burden of multiple testing. We chose the SNP with the lowest p-value for each gene ( Figure 1 ) and tested them for gender effects in the full sample. After this analysis, we performed a post-hoc exploratory analysis for all of the tag SNPs in each gene to see if other loci produced stronger association signals.  Genotyping The genotyping for SNPs was performed using a multiple base extension reaction with allele discrimination by MassArray mass spectrometry system (Bruker-Sequenom) as previously described ( Sklar and others 2002 ).

Genotypes from intra- and inter-plate controls were compared for accuracy, and negative test controls were confirmed to have no genotypes called. In addition, assays that failed in over 10% of the samples were excluded and samples that failed in over 10% of the assays were excluded. SNPs with a Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium p-value less than 0.001 were excluded from analysis. Families with Mendel error rates greater than 5% and SNPs with Mendel error rates greater than 1% were excluded.  Statistical Analysis The pedigree data were screened for genotype inconsistencies by using PLINK ( http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/ ) (Purcell and others In press). PLINK was also used to assess genotype distributions for departures from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. The TDTPHASE program of the UNPHASED set ( Dudbridge 2003 ) was used for TDT analysis of transmission to each sex. We also tested whether there was a statistically significant difference between the transmissions to males vs. transmissions to females (gender effect) for each gene using a standard chi-square test with 1 degree of freedom. To examine the overall effect of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism in two independent samples including our families and another case-control study ( Qian and others 2003 ), we converted each chi-square value to z scores, using the formula (?2-n)/? 2n, where n is the degrees of freedom for the chi square value. The combined z score was obtained using the inverse normal method by adding the two z scores and then dividing the sum by ?2 ( Hedges and Olkin 1985 ).  Results The most significant SNPs for each gene as a result of the TDT analysis in the full sample are shown in Table 2 . SNPs rs4680 (val158met) from COMT and rs3785143 from SLC6A2 showed nominally significant (p<0.05) association, while the other two SNPs (rs3027399 from MAOA and rs2066713 from SLC6A4) were not significant. As we have reported previously ( Kim and others 2007 ), the association of rs3785143 with ADHD is a direct replication of a previous finding ( Brookes and others 2006 ). In gender-stratified analyses of COMT , we observed over-transmission of the Met (A) allele to male offspring (OR=1.42, 95% CI= 1.12-1.81; p=0.003) but not to female offspring (p=0.936) ( Table 2 ). This replicates a previous finding which reported significant association of the Met (A) allele of Val158Met in males with ADHD ( Qian and others 2003 ). For SLC6A2, we found that the T allele of rs3785143 displayed a stronger effect in females (OR=2.11, 95% CI= 1.20 -3.69; p=0.006) than in males (p=0.370) ( Table 2 ). For MAOA, the SNP associating to ADHD in the full sample (rs3027399; p=0.093) showed a nominally significant effect for females (OR=2.5, 95% CI=1.10-5.67; p=0.02) but not for males (p=0.757) ( Table 2 ). Finally, we observed no evidence of association between the SLC6A4 SNP rs2066713 with ADHD, either in the full sample or when stratified by gender. Despite the apparent gender differences from the stratified analyses, our formal test of gender differences did not detect a significant gender effect across the four genes (P>0.05 for each polymorphism) ( Table 2 .). However, when we combined our COMT (Val158Met) data with data from another study which investigated the sex effect of Val158Met ( Qian et al 2003 ), the pooled result showed a statistically significant gender effect for Val158Met in ADHD (z=2.69, p=0.007) ( Table 3 ). We also performed an exploratory analysis by looking at every SNP marker of each gene to see whether we missed any SNP that may have shown a gender specific effect. As a consequence, we have discovered a nominally significant effect (p<0.05) for COMT (rs2239393; p=0.054) and SLC6A2 (rs36020; p=0.014) ( Table 4 ). However, these results did not survive correction for multiple testing by Bonferroni’s method.  Results The most significant SNPs for each gene as a result of the TDT analysis in the full sample are shown in Table 2 . SNPs rs4680 (val158met) from COMT and rs3785143 from SLC6A2 showed nominally significant (p<0.05) association, while the other two SNPs (rs3027399 from MAOA and rs2066713 from SLC6A4) were not significant. As we have reported previously ( Kim and others 2007 ), the association of rs3785143 with ADHD is a direct replication of a previous finding ( Brookes and others 2006 ). In gender-stratified analyses of COMT , we observed over-transmission of the Met (A) allele to male offspring (OR=1.42, 95% CI= 1.12-1.81; p=0.003) but not to female offspring (p=0.936) ( Table 2 ). This replicates a previous finding which reported significant association of the Met (A) allele of Val158Met in males with ADHD ( Qian and others 2003 ). For SLC6A2, we found that the T allele of rs3785143 displayed a stronger effect in females (OR=2.11, 95% CI= 1.20 -3.69; p=0.006) than in males (p=0.370) ( Table 2 ). For MAOA, the SNP associating to ADHD in the full sample (rs3027399; p=0.093) showed a nominally significant effect for females (OR=2.5, 95% CI=1.10-5.67; p=0.02) but not for males (p=0.757) ( Table 2 ). Finally, we observed no evidence of association between the SLC6A4 SNP rs2066713 with ADHD, either in the full sample or when stratified by gender. Despite the apparent gender differences from the stratified analyses, our formal test of gender differences did not detect a significant gender effect across the four genes (P>0.05 for each polymorphism) ( Table 2 .). However, when we combined our COMT (Val158Met) data with data from another study which investigated the sex effect of Val158Met ( Qian et al 2003 ), the pooled result showed a statistically significant gender effect for Val158Met in ADHD (z=2.69, p=0.007) ( Table 3 ). We also performed an exploratory analysis by looking at every SNP marker of each gene to see whether we missed any SNP that may have shown a gender specific effect. As a consequence, we have discovered a nominally significant effect (p<0.05) for COMT (rs2239393; p=0.054) and SLC6A2 (rs36020; p=0.014) ( Table 4 ). However, these results did not survive correction for multiple testing by Bonferroni’s method.  Discussion By stratifying by sex, we observed modest evidence of association between ADHD and variants in three genes that was not evident in our full family-based sample. The effect sizes are modest (OR=1.2~2.5) as expected for a complex genetic disorder, and a formal test of gender differences was not significant. Nevertheless, when we pooled our COMT data with a prior report we did find a significant gender differences for the Val158Met allele. Although our exploratory analysis ( Table 4 ) found gender specific effect for two SNPs, there are some limitations. First, although two SNPs (rs2239393, rs36020) showed nominally significant (p<0.05) gender effects, it did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing . Second, rs2239393 (COMT) is in high LD (D’=0.99; r2=0.73) with rs4680 and thus highly correlated to the rs4680 association. It is also an intronic SNP with no known functional effects and it may be unlikely that it will have any causative effect. Third, while rs36020 (SLC6A2) showed a gender specific effect in the chi-square test, stratified results for each sex were not significant ( Table 4 ). This happened since the involved allele merely ran in opposite directions in each group. Since there is no effect for either males or females, this is a false-positive finding. We observed association of the Met (A) allele of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism in males (OR=1.42, 95% CI= 1.12-1.81; p=0.003) but not females (p=0.936) with ADHD, replicating the findings of Qian et al. (2003) , however, because this latter study was a case-control study, its results could have been an artifact of population stratification. Evidence from previous genetic and biological studies also indicates that the Met allele plays a deleterious role specifically in males. It has been consistently reported to be associated with aggressive and impulsive behavior in males ( Gogos 1998 ; Strous 1997; Lachman 1998; Kotler 1999; Strous 2003). Similarly, COMT deficient mice show elevated aggressive behavior in males only ( Gogos and others 1998 ). This is in concert with a report that ADHD boys display more hyperactive/impulsive behaviors and other externalizing behaviors such as conduct problems than do girls with ADHD ( Abikoff and others 2002 ; Biederman and others 2002 ; Gaub and Carlson 1997b ). One recent meta-analytic study ( Pooley and others 2007 ) found that the Met allele of COMT was significantly associated with obsessive compulsive disorder for males only. The effects of the Val158Met polymorphism on brain dopaminergic (DA) transmission are complex ( Bilder and others 2004 ). The Met allele is associated with decreased synaptic DA transmission subcortically and increased DA concentrations cortically. The Val allele is associated with increased synaptic DA transmissions subcortically and decreased DA concentrations cortically. Despite this prior evidence for a stronger association of COMT for males, if COMT is associated with ADHD, meta-analyses of prior work (which used primarily male samples) should have found a significant effect but did not ( Cheuk and Wong 2006 ). We also observed gender-based differences in association with a SNP in SLC6A2 . Specifically, the T allele of rs3785143 displayed association with ADHD for females (OR=2.11, 95% CI= 1.20 -3.69; p=0.006) but not for males (p=0.370). SNP rs3785143 is located in intron 1, a region reported to be responsible for high-level transcription of SLC6A2 . Previous findings from animal studies suggest that dysfunction of the SLC6A2 gene may be more harmful to females that males ( Curtis and others 2006 ; Keller and others 2006 ). A recent study compared the activation of the locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine (NE) system in response to stress between female and male rats ( Curtis and others 2006 ). The mean basal LC discharge rate was similar between groups. However, the magnitude of LC activation elicited by hypotensive stress was substantially greater in females, regardless of hormonal status. The difference in stress sensitivity could be attributed to the differential postsynaptic sensitivity of LC neurons to corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), which mediates LC activation by hypotension. CRF was 10-30 times more potent in activating LC neurons in female vs male rats. In mice lacking the norepinephrine transporter ( SLC6A2 ) gene, females appear to be significantly more vulnerable to anxiogenic challenges than male mice in several measures of fear and anxiety ( Keller and others 2006 ). With respect to MAOA, we also observed nominal evidence of association of rs3027399 in females only (OR=2.5, 95% CI=1.10-5.67; p=0.02). This SNP is an intronic SNP which has no evidence of any functional effect currently but it is possible that this SNP may be in LD with a nearby functional variant. Our study is not the first to report a stronger association for female ADHD with MAOA. Manor et al (2002) previously reported an association for MAOA in females with ADHD ( Manor and others 2002 ). They investigated a 30 bp VNTR located 1.2kb upstream in the promoter region of the MAOA gene which is reported to be associated with transcriptional efficiency ( Sabol and others 1998 ). Data from the International HapMap Project (CEU; release 22) indicate that the entire MAOA gene region (including the 10kb upstream promoter region) is actually one large haplotype block using the most conservative block defining method ( Gabriel and others 2002 ). Thus, while we did not genotype the promoter VNTR, it is likely to be that rs3027399 is in LD with it. Results from these two ADHD genetic studies show that MAOA association may be female specific for ADHD. Our results should be evaluated in the context of several limitations. Our significant gender effect for COMT obtained by combining two disparate samples could be a false positive result and the finding from the case-control study could be due to population stratification. All of our results are vulnerable to the possibility of Type 1 errors because no correction for multiple testing was made. If the effects we observed are real, they are very small, which highlights the difficulty of finding a suitable replication sample and questions the value of the result in explaining much of the genetic diathesis of ADHD. Despite these limitations, by stratifying by offspring sex, we observed modest evidence of gender effects of COMT, SLC6A2 and MAOA with ADHD. The findings of our study need to be replicated in other independent samples for corroboration. Our results suggest that future studies of genes with biological evidence of sexually dimorphic effects should examine gender-specific effects.  Discussion By stratifying by sex, we observed modest evidence of association between ADHD and variants in three genes that was not evident in our full family-based sample. The effect sizes are modest (OR=1.2~2.5) as expected for a complex genetic disorder, and a formal test of gender differences was not significant. Nevertheless, when we pooled our COMT data with a prior report we did find a significant gender differences for the Val158Met allele. Although our exploratory analysis ( Table 4 ) found gender specific effect for two SNPs, there are some limitations. First, although two SNPs (rs2239393, rs36020) showed nominally significant (p<0.05) gender effects, it did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing . Second, rs2239393 (COMT) is in high LD (D’=0.99; r2=0.73) with rs4680 and thus highly correlated to the rs4680 association. It is also an intronic SNP with no known functional effects and it may be unlikely that it will have any causative effect. Third, while rs36020 (SLC6A2) showed a gender specific effect in the chi-square test, stratified results for each sex were not significant ( Table 4 ). This happened since the involved allele merely ran in opposite directions in each group. Since there is no effect for either males or females, this is a false-positive finding. We observed association of the Met (A) allele of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism in males (OR=1.42, 95% CI= 1.12-1.81; p=0.003) but not females (p=0.936) with ADHD, replicating the findings of Qian et al.

The Val allele is associated with increased synaptic DA transmissions subcortically and decreased DA concentrations cortically. Despite this prior evidence for a stronger association of COMT for males, if COMT is associated with ADHD, meta-analyses of prior work (which used primarily male samples) should have found a significant effect but did not ( Cheuk and Wong 2006 ). We also observed gender-based differences in association with a SNP in SLC6A2 . Specifically, the T allele of rs3785143 displayed association with ADHD for females (OR=2.11, 95% CI= 1.20 -3.69; p=0.006) but not for males (p=0.370).

With respect to MAOA, we also observed nominal evidence of association of rs3027399 in females only (OR=2.5, 95% CI=1.10-5.67; p=0.02). This SNP is an intronic SNP which has no evidence of any functional effect currently but it is possible that this SNP may be in LD with a nearby functional variant. Our study is not the first to report a stronger association for female ADHD with MAOA. Manor et al (2002) previously reported an association for MAOA in females with ADHD ( Manor and others 2002 ). They investigated a 30 bp VNTR located 1.2kb upstream in the promoter region of the MAOA gene which is reported to be associated with transcriptional efficiency ( Sabol and others 1998 ).

Thus, while we did not genotype the promoter VNTR, it is likely to be that rs3027399 is in LD with it. Results from these two ADHD genetic studies show that MAOA association may be female specific for ADHD. Our results should be evaluated in the context of several limitations. Our significant gender effect for COMT obtained by combining two disparate samples could be a false positive result and the finding from the case-control study could be due to population stratification. All of our results are vulnerable to the possibility of Type 1 errors because no correction for multiple testing was made. If the effects we observed are real, they are very small, which highlights the difficulty of finding a suitable replication sample and questions the value of the result in explaining much of the genetic diathesis of ADHD. Despite these limitations, by stratifying by offspring sex, we observed modest evidence of gender effects of COMT, SLC6A2 and MAOA with ADHD. The findings of our study need to be replicated in other independent samples for corroboration. Our results suggest that future studies of genes with biological evidence of sexually dimorphic effects should examine gender-specific effects.
