Role of DMP1 and its future in lung cancer diagnostics Lung cancer is the most lethal carcinoma worldwide. Mutations of p53, inactivation of p16INK4a, and overexpression of cyclins E, A and B are independently associated with poor prognoses of patients, while the prognostic value of cyclin D1 or RB expression is inconclusive. Cyclin D binding myb-like protein 1 (Dmp1) encodes a DNA binding protein that receives signals from oncogenic Ras and functions as a tumor suppressor by activating the Arf-p53 pathway. Dmp1 has been shown to be haplo-insufficient for tumor suppression in mouse models including K-ras-mediated lung carcinogenesis. The human DMP1 gene is located on chromosome 7q21, and our recent results revealed that the hDMP1 gene is deleted, but not mutated or silenced, in approximately 40 % of human non-small-cell lung carcinomas. These cases typically retained wild-type ARF and p53 and expressed very low levels of the h DMP1 protein. Thus, hDMP1 loss could be a novel diagnostic marker for non-small-cell lung carcinomas.
