Targeted deletion of hepatocyte Ikk? confers growth advantages Mice lacking hepatocyte IKK? ( Ikk? ?hep ) are defective in TNF?-activation of hepatocellular transcription factor NF-?B, and highly susceptible to hepatotoxicity. Following diethylnitrosamine (DEN) exposure, Ikk? ?hep mice develop more hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than control mice due partly to enhanced DEN-induced hepatocyte death. Here we show that Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes display growth advantages over normal hepatocytes consisting of precocious PCNA and cyclin D1 expression during liver regeneration (shortened hepatocyte G0 ? G1 transitions), and enhanced recovery efficiency, cyclin D1 expression and cell proliferation after plating. Ex vivo deletion of Ikk? also accelerates hepatocyte growth. Ikk? ?hep hepatocyte proliferative responses show heightened sensitivity to TGF? and TNF?, and heightened expression of fibronectin, collagens I/III, nidogen, ?-actin and integrin ?1 mRNAs. These findings suggest that altered mitogen signaling and expression of extracellular matrix and its associated components underlie growth advantages. Increased HCC development in Ikk? ?hep mice may also be caused by growth advantages of surviving Ikk? -deleted hepatocytes.  Materials and methods Animals Ikk? F/F and Ikk? F/F : Alb-Cre (referred to as Ikk? ?hep ) mice were maintained per NIH guidelines [ 6 ]. Homogeneous backgrounds were obtained by backcrossing Ikk? F/F with C57BL/6J mice for ? 8 generations. Ikk? F/F : Alb-Cre ? mice were bred with Ikk? F/F ? mice to generate Ikk? F/F and Ikk? ?hep ? littermates; these and C57BL/6J mice were used at 6–8 weeks. Liver regeneration and tissue processing Seventy percent PH and sham hepatectomy, and liver analyses (histology; DNA, RNA, and proteins) were described elsewhere [ 7 ]. Apoptotic cells were quantified by TUNEL assays [ 7 ]. Genotyping, deletion analysis, PCR and real time Q-PCR Cre and F/F alleles, and Ikk? deletions were assessed by PCR assays of tail, liver and cultured hepatocyte DNA [ 6 , 7 ]. Q-PCR was performed on liver, and freshly isolated and cultured hepatocyte RNA ( Suppl. Table 1 lists primers); results were normalized to glyceral-dehyde phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels [ 11 ]. Primary culture Hepatocytes were isolated by intraportal perfusion using a 23G-needle with 5 ml digestion buffer containing 0.5 mg Sigma Type I collagenase/ml [ 12 ; Appendix A ]. Cells were plated ( N 0 = initial cell concentrations) into uncoated plastic 35 mm-diameter tissue culture dishes or 10 mm-diameter 24-multiwell plates (NUNC) containing 2 ml or 1 ml plating medium [ 12 ], respectively. Human TGF? and mouse TNF? (R&D) were aliquoted into serum-free medium and stored at ?20 °C until use. Attached cells were trypsinized from cultures washed 3× with PBS and Coulter-counted. Adenoviruses Ad-CMV-Cre adenovirus (Vector Biolabs) was amplified in HEK293 cells. Ad-CMV-GFP was constructed by inserting GFP cDNA into a pshuttle-CMV transfer vector (Stratagene); GFP-expressing adenovirus was obtained via homologous recombination between pshuttle-CMV-GFP and pAdEasy-1 (Stratagene). Titers were obtained using HEK293 cells [ 13 ]. Hepatocytes were infected at a multiplicity of infection = 10. BrdU L.I., immunofluorescence and Western blots L.I. measurements were made in cultures exposed 18 h to 10 ?M BrdU, followed by washing, overnight fixation in 4% formalin and re-washing. Immunofluorescence staining (BrdU = red, albumin = green) was performed using 1°-rabbit anti-BrdU and goat anti-albumin antibodies (Megabase), and 2°-donkey Alexa 594-conjugated anti-rabbit- and chick Alexa 488-conjugated anti-goat antibodies (Invitrogen), respectively; no staining occurred in the absence of 1°- or 2°-antibodies. To circumvent problems arising from heterogeneously distributed cells, ? 2000 hepatocytes, visualized microscopically using a dual red–green filter (Chroma Technology), were scored over similar evenly-spaced sites/dish. Photomicrographs (Ni-kon DXM1200C camera) were archived using Nikon software. Western blots were performed using anti-PCNA and cyclin D1 (PC10 and M-20, Santa Cruz sc-56 and 718), IKK? (10AG2, Imgenex IMG129A) and anti-actin (Sigma A4700) antibodies [ 7 ]. Statistical analysis Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Significance (P ? 0.05) was judged by 1-way ANOVA or Student’s t -tests. Areas under curves (AUC) were calculated with SigmaPlot v.7 software.  Animals Ikk? F/F and Ikk?

Results Targeted Ikk? deletion accelerates PCNA and cyclin D1 expression and shortens hepatocyte G<sub>0</sub> ? G<sub>1</sub> transitions during liver regeneration after PH G0 ? G1 transitions were shortened after 70% PH in Ikk? ?hep mice ( Fig. 1A ), as shown by elevated and sustained levels of PCNA at 24–60 h, and cyclin D1 at 24–48 h. Similar changes, absent after sham hepatectomy, did not occur until 36 h in control Ikk ?F/F mice, in which cyclin D1 levels oscillated and peaked between 36 and 60 h ( Fig. 1A ). Intergenotypic differences ( Fig. 1A ) agreed with published hepatocyte BrdU L.I. values: S-phase onset times, S t [ 14 ], were shortened in Ikk? ?hep mice, as shown by a 200-fold higher BrdU L.I. (10%) compared to controls (0.05%) at 24 h ( P < 0.0001); BrdU L.I. levels peaked normally in both groups [ 15 ] by 36 h, and BrdU-staining occurred only in hepatocytes [ 7 ]. Ikk? ?hep mitotic indexes (M.I.) were higher than Ikk? F/F controls by ~40% at peak mitotic times (48 h; Fig. 1B ); however, apoptotic hepatocyte fractions were equivalent in both strains at 0–36 h ( Fig. 1C ). ?1-Fetoprotein positive oval-like cells (not shown), inflammatory cells or necrotic hepatocytes were not observed ( Fig. 1B ). Thus, Ikk? deletion enhanced hepatocyte proliferation during liver regeneration without affecting apoptosis. Differences between plating and growth properties of Ikk?<sup>F/F</sup> and Ikk?<sup>hep</sup> hepatocytes are revealed in primary culture To determine whether Ikk? deletion directly affects growth, primary cultures were prepared in the absence of non-parenchymal cells. Hepatocytes spread and flattened between d1 and d4, as expected [ 12 ] ( Suppl. Fig. 1A ); consistent with growth ( Fig. 2A ), more hepatocytes were seen between d4 and d24 and, after ~3 population doublings, large differentiated hepatocyte-aggregates appeared ( Suppl. Fig. 1A ). Growth curves ( Fig. 2A ) showed intergenotypic differences when cells were plated at varying concentrations. At low N 0(1.5 ×105 cells/dish), d1 Ikk? ?hep hepatocyte R.E. [ 15 ] exceeded controls ( Ikk? ?hep ~ 58–68% > Ikk? F/F ~ 36–38%, Suppl. Fig. 1A ). Because R.E. curves were linear over a broad N 0 range ( Suppl. Fig. 2 ), such differences were unlikely results of differential media conditioning [ 16 ]. When plateau phase was attained (d12), Ikk? ?hep hepatocyte numbers exceeded controls by ~1.5-fold ( P < 0.01). At progressively higher N 0 (3 × 105 or 6 × 105), although d2–d8 growth rates and d12–d21 plateau densities were similar, intergenotypic R.E. differences were sustained ( Ikk? ?hep > Ikk? F/F , Suppl. Fig. 2 ), Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes/dish exceeded controls until d8 ( P < 0.0001), and Ikk? ?hep lag phases relative to controls were attenuated ( P < 0.003, Fig. 2A ). Additional findings support cell-autonomous growth differences between Ikk? F/F and Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes. First, because both kinds of hepatocytes came from age- and weight-matched littermates, and were isolated with similar yields and viabilities ( Suppl. Table 2 ), the results could not be explained by differences in these parameters. Second, non-parenchymal cells could not have contributed measurably to growth because cell isolation and plating conditions select against non-hepatocyte survival [ 10 , 12 , 16 ]; this was visually evident from uniform d1 hepatocyte morphologies ( Suppl. Fig. 1 ) and findings that >90% of cells expressed hepatocyte-specific albumin in d1 cultures ( Fig. 2D [ top curves]; Suppl. Fig. 1B ). Genotyping analysis failed to reveal significant levels of non-parenchymal Ikk? DNA (an ~2-kb product generated from intact Ikk? genomes) in freshly isolated (0-time) or cultured Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes on d3–d4 ( Fig. 2B ) or d8 (not shown). The origins of trace 2-kb bands in d1–d2 cultures is unclear; such bands represented <0.1% of observed PCR products and were absent in 0-time cells (they may have come from rare non-hepatocyte contaminants, undetected at 0-time and lost from cultures as selection-pressure prevailed). Non-hepatocyte-derived IKK? proteins were also undetectable in d1 Ikk? ?hep cultures [ 6 ], consistent with ~6-fold intergenotypic differences in Ikk? mRNA levels in d1–d6 cultures ( Ikk? F/F > Ikk? ?hep , P < 0.00004; Fig. 2C ). Thus targeted Ikk? deletion conferred growth advantages to Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes that are independent of non-parenchymal cells. Targeted Ikk? deletion causes precocious expression of cyclin D1 and enhanced S-phase entry in primary hepatocytes To investigate growth-associated cell-cycle parameters, S-phase entry and cyclin D1 expression were measured d1–d8 post-plating. If precocious G0,1 ? S transitions were properties of growth-stimulated Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes, BrdU L.I. and cyclin D1 expression levels should be augmented compared to controls. Indeed, S-phase entry (visualized by scoring BrdU + albumin + cells, Suppl. Fig. 1B ) was specifically 2-fold higher in Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes between d1 and d4 ( P < 0.009; Fig. 2D , bottom curves). Using 18h labeling intervals to exclude scoring log-phase cells transiting S-phase more than once (given ~72 h population doubling times, Fig. 2A ), BrdU labeled mitotic hepatocytes were also detected ( Fig. 2E ). Cyclin D1 mRNA expression peaked bimodaly d3 and d6, and declined towards baseline on d8 in both groups; however, Ikk? ?hep hepatocyte rates and peak amplitudes of cyclin D1 mRNA expression exceeded controls ( P < 1.8 ×10?5, Fig. 2F ). Albumin expression did not parallel intergenotypic G1 ? S transition differences; instead, it changed inversely with growth-state (12): highest initially on d1, with its L.I. falling to 80–82% ( Fig. 2D , top curves) as log–growth ensued ( Fig. 2A and D [ bottom curves]). Thus, constitutive Ikk? deletion directly enhanced hepatocyte proliferative transitions. Ex vivo deletion of Ikk? stimulates hepatocyte proliferation To circumvent strain-dependent R.E., the effects of abrupt Ikk? deletion were investigated in equal numbers of Ikk? F/F hepatocytes ( N 0 = 3 × 105) infected with Cre recombinase-expressing (Ad-Cre) or control GFP-expressing adenovirus (Ad-GFP). Ad-Cre infection effectively deleted Ikk? ( Suppl. Fig. 3A ) and stimulated proliferation compared to controls ( P < 0.0009; Fig. 3A , top panel). Ad-Cre infection also augmented rates and levels of hepatocyte BrdU labeling ( P < 0.05; Fig. 3A , bottom panel). Net increases in cells/dish and L.I. were similar to uninfected Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes ( Figs. 2A and D [ bottom curves]). Ad-Cre infection also augmented cyclin D1 ( P < 0.05; Fig. 3B , top panel) and reduced IKK? mRNA expression ( P < 0.0001; Fig. 3B , bottom panel) compared to controls. Neither Cre expression artifacts [ 17 ] nor cytotoxicity could have caused Ad-Cre-augmented responses because equivalent growth ( Suppl. Fig. 3B ) and albumin expression curves (not shown) of Ad-Cre, Ad-GFP- or vehicle-treated C57BL/6 hepatocytes were observed. Ikk? deletion affects hepatocyte growth-signaling systems Signaling system components, including mitogens and mitogen receptor/ECM/basement membrane/cytoskeleton/integrin complexes concertedly regulate hepatocyte growth [ 14 , 18 ]. Therefore, selected components were investigated for growth advantage-correlations in Ikk? ?hep cells. Firstly, increased receptor sensitivities to mitogens were monitored by quantifying growth-responses to TGF? or TNF?. Mitogens were added after attachment (d1) and replicate cell counts measured d1–d9 ( Suppl. Fig. 4 and Table 3 ). Again, Ikk? ?hep hepatocyte R.E. exceeded controls by ~2-fold. Without added mitogens, following a long lag-phase >3–5d (perhaps due to differences between multiwells and dishes), Ikk? ?hep hepatocyte growth surged between d5 and d7, ahead of controls d7–d9. With added mitogens, lag phases shortened; by d7, Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes responded better than controls to TNF? ( P < 0.0005) and TGF? ( P < 0.03): Suppl. Fig. 4 shows nearly doubled peak numbers of cells. These results suggested that Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes were more sensitive to mitogens than controls, a conclusion more evident when data were plotted as mitogen dose-response curves ( Fig. 4A ). Left-shifts occurred in both groups. Ikk? ?hep responses to TGF? plateaued before controls (attenuated responses were not observed.). In contrast, both groups showed biphasic TNF? responses, heightened in Ikk? ?hep cultures in which TNF?-dependent growth was considerably higher at low or blunted at high ligand concentrations ( Fig. 4A ). Secondly, correlations with ECM, basement membrane, cytoskeletal and mitogen receptor-associated integrin mRNA expression were investigated [ 19 ]. Specifically elevated changes ( Ikk? ?hep > Ikk? F/F ) were observed in 6 of 12 candidate mRNAs surveyed between d1 and d6 ( Fig. 4B ): fibronectin, collagens I and III, nidogen, ?-actin, and EGF receptor-associated integrin B1. No differences were seen in laminin, elastin, FAK, SPARC, or mitogen receptor-associated integrin B3 (c-MET) or B4 (insulin) mRNAs, or in freshly isolated hepatocyte, or Ikk? ?hep and control liver mRNAs.

Hepatocytes spread and flattened between d1 and d4, as expected [ 12 ] ( Suppl. Fig. 1A ); consistent with growth ( Fig. 2A ), more hepatocytes were seen between d4 and d24 and, after ~3 population doublings, large differentiated hepatocyte-aggregates appeared ( Suppl. Fig. 1A ). Growth curves ( Fig. 2A ) showed intergenotypic differences when cells were plated at varying concentrations. At low N 0(1.5 ×105 cells/dish), d1 Ikk? ?hep hepatocyte R.E. [ 15 ] exceeded controls ( Ikk? ?hep ~ 58–68% > Ikk? F/F ~ 36–38%, Suppl. Fig. 1A ). Because R.E. curves were linear over a broad N 0 range ( Suppl. Fig. 2 ), such differences were unlikely results of differential media conditioning [ 16 ]. When plateau phase was attained (d12), Ikk? ?hep hepatocyte numbers exceeded controls by ~1.5-fold ( P < 0.01). At progressively higher N 0 (3 × 105 or 6 × 105), although d2–d8 growth rates and d12–d21 plateau densities were similar, intergenotypic R.E. differences were sustained ( Ikk? ?hep > Ikk? F/F , Suppl. Fig. 2 ), Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes/dish exceeded controls until d8 ( P < 0.0001), and Ikk? ?hep lag phases relative to controls were attenuated ( P < 0.003, Fig. 2A ). Additional findings support cell-autonomous growth differences between Ikk? F/F and Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes. First, because both kinds of hepatocytes came from age- and weight-matched littermates, and were isolated with similar yields and viabilities ( Suppl. Table 2 ), the results could not be explained by differences in these parameters. Second, non-parenchymal cells could not have contributed measurably to growth because cell isolation and plating conditions select against non-hepatocyte survival [ 10 , 12 , 16 ]; this was visually evident from uniform d1 hepatocyte morphologies ( Suppl. Fig. 1 ) and findings that >90% of cells expressed hepatocyte-specific albumin in d1 cultures ( Fig. 2D [ top curves]; Suppl. Fig. 1B ). Genotyping analysis failed to reveal significant levels of non-parenchymal Ikk? DNA (an ~2-kb product generated from intact Ikk? genomes) in freshly isolated (0-time) or cultured Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes on d3–d4 ( Fig. 2B ) or d8 (not shown). The origins of trace 2-kb bands in d1–d2 cultures is unclear; such bands represented <0.1% of observed PCR products and were absent in 0-time cells (they may have come from rare non-hepatocyte contaminants, undetected at 0-time and lost from cultures as selection-pressure prevailed). Non-hepatocyte-derived IKK? proteins were also undetectable in d1 Ikk? ?hep cultures [ 6 ], consistent with ~6-fold intergenotypic differences in Ikk? mRNA levels in d1–d6 cultures ( Ikk? F/F > Ikk? ?hep , P < 0.00004; Fig. 2C ). Thus targeted Ikk? deletion conferred growth advantages to Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes that are independent of non-parenchymal cells.

Targeted Ikk? deletion causes precocious expression of cyclin D1 and enhanced S-phase entry in primary hepatocytes To investigate growth-associated cell-cycle parameters, S-phase entry and cyclin D1 expression were measured d1–d8 post-plating. If precocious G0,1 ? S transitions were properties of growth-stimulated Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes, BrdU L.I. and cyclin D1 expression levels should be augmented compared to controls. Indeed, S-phase entry (visualized by scoring BrdU + albumin + cells, Suppl. Fig. 1B ) was specifically 2-fold higher in Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes between d1 and d4 ( P < 0.009; Fig. 2D , bottom curves). Using 18h labeling intervals to exclude scoring log-phase cells transiting S-phase more than once (given ~72 h population doubling times, Fig. 2A ), BrdU labeled mitotic hepatocytes were also detected ( Fig. 2E ). Cyclin D1 mRNA expression peaked bimodaly d3 and d6, and declined towards baseline on d8 in both groups; however, Ikk? ?hep hepatocyte rates and peak amplitudes of cyclin D1 mRNA expression exceeded controls ( P < 1.8 ×10?5, Fig. 2F ). Albumin expression did not parallel intergenotypic G1 ? S transition differences; instead, it changed inversely with growth-state (12): highest initially on d1, with its L.I. falling to 80–82% ( Fig. 2D , top curves) as log–growth ensued ( Fig. 2A and D [ bottom curves]). Thus, constitutive Ikk? deletion directly enhanced hepatocyte proliferative transitions.

Thus, constitutive Ikk? deletion directly enhanced hepatocyte proliferative transitions.  Ex vivo deletion of Ikk? stimulates hepatocyte proliferation To circumvent strain-dependent R.E., the effects of abrupt Ikk? deletion were investigated in equal numbers of Ikk? F/F hepatocytes ( N 0 = 3 × 105) infected with Cre recombinase-expressing (Ad-Cre) or control GFP-expressing adenovirus (Ad-GFP). Ad-Cre infection effectively deleted Ikk? ( Suppl. Fig. 3A ) and stimulated proliferation compared to controls ( P < 0.0009; Fig. 3A , top panel). Ad-Cre infection also augmented rates and levels of hepatocyte BrdU labeling ( P < 0.05; Fig. 3A , bottom panel). Net increases in cells/dish and L.I. were similar to uninfected Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes ( Figs. 2A and D [ bottom curves]). Ad-Cre infection also augmented cyclin D1 ( P < 0.05; Fig. 3B , top panel) and reduced IKK? mRNA expression ( P < 0.0001; Fig. 3B , bottom panel) compared to controls. Neither Cre expression artifacts [ 17 ] nor cytotoxicity could have caused Ad-Cre-augmented responses because equivalent growth ( Suppl. Fig. 3B ) and albumin expression curves (not shown) of Ad-Cre, Ad-GFP- or vehicle-treated C57BL/6 hepatocytes were observed.

Ikk? deletion affects hepatocyte growth-signaling systems Signaling system components, including mitogens and mitogen receptor/ECM/basement membrane/cytoskeleton/integrin complexes concertedly regulate hepatocyte growth [ 14 , 18 ]. Therefore, selected components were investigated for growth advantage-correlations in Ikk? ?hep cells. Firstly, increased receptor sensitivities to mitogens were monitored by quantifying growth-responses to TGF? or TNF?. Mitogens were added after attachment (d1) and replicate cell counts measured d1–d9 ( Suppl. Fig. 4 and Table 3 ). Again, Ikk? ?hep hepatocyte R.E. exceeded controls by ~2-fold. Without added mitogens, following a long lag-phase >3–5d (perhaps due to differences between multiwells and dishes), Ikk? ?hep hepatocyte growth surged between d5 and d7, ahead of controls d7–d9. With added mitogens, lag phases shortened; by d7, Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes responded better than controls to TNF? ( P < 0.0005) and TGF? ( P < 0.03): Suppl. Fig. 4 shows nearly doubled peak numbers of cells. These results suggested that Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes were more sensitive to mitogens than controls, a conclusion more evident when data were plotted as mitogen dose-response curves ( Fig. 4A ). Left-shifts occurred in both groups. Ikk? ?hep responses to TGF? plateaued before controls (attenuated responses were not observed.). In contrast, both groups showed biphasic TNF? responses, heightened in Ikk? ?hep cultures in which TNF?-dependent growth was considerably higher at low or blunted at high ligand concentrations ( Fig. 4A ). Secondly, correlations with ECM, basement membrane, cytoskeletal and mitogen receptor-associated integrin mRNA expression were investigated [ 19 ]. Specifically elevated changes ( Ikk? ?hep > Ikk? F/F ) were observed in 6 of 12 candidate mRNAs surveyed between d1 and d6 ( Fig. 4B ): fibronectin, collagens I and III, nidogen, ?-actin, and EGF receptor-associated integrin B1. No differences were seen in laminin, elastin, FAK, SPARC, or mitogen receptor-associated integrin B3 (c-MET) or B4 (insulin) mRNAs, or in freshly isolated hepatocyte, or Ikk? ?hep and control liver mRNAs.

Discussion We have shown that constitutively Ikk? deleted ( Ikk? ?hep ) or ex vivo Ikk? deleted Ikk? F/F hepatocytes have growth advantages over Ikk? -expressing hepatocytes. These advantages are associated with attenuated levels of IKK? mRNA and augmented levels of cy-clin D1 mRNA; cell-cycle expression patterns of IKK? and cyclin D1 proteins and activities will require further clarification. In contrast, when intrahepatic mitogen mRNA expression is reduced throughout liver by the deletion of Ikk? in hepatocytes and hematopoietic-derived cells ( Ikk? ?LIV mice), in vivo hepatocyte growth advantages expected of Ikk? deleted hepatocytes following 70% PH are absent [ 7 ]. Thus, IKK? is a bifunctional regulator of hepatocyte proliferation and HCC, with different roles played by hepatocytes and liver non-parenchymal cells; enhanced HCC in DEN-treated Ikk? ?hep mice requires the effects of IKK?-dependant Kupffer cell-derived cytokines and the loss of growth-inhibitory hepatocyte IKK?. Because primary culture studies, and dual investigations with Ikk? ?hep and Ikk? ?LIV knockout mice [ 7 ], were needed to reach both conclusions (otherwise missed by unicellular targeting), the potential regulation of HCC-suppressors including pRb, p53 and p21 [ 20 ] by non-parenchymal cells should not be overlooked. Bifunctional IKK? implicates cell-specificity. This is supported by studies with embryonic Ikk? ?/? fibroblasts which grow faster but plate with identical efficiency compared to controls [ 21 ], and Ikk? ?/? Hela cells which undergo mitotic arrest [ 22 ]. Investigations with Ikk2 ?hepa mice [ 23 , 24 ] also suggest that hepatocyte IKK? survival functions depend on IKK? and IKK? [ 25 ]; however, different Ikk? -targeting strategies may have differentially affected Ikk2 ?hepa mice because findings of PH-induced inflammation indirectly shortening hepatocyte St and abnormally delayed post-PH BrdU L.I. peaks [ 15 , 24 ] disagree with findings in Ikk? ?hep mice [ 6 , 23 ]. G0 and proliferating Ikk? ?hep populations consist only of hepatocytes. Therefore, exceedingly rare hepatocyte progenitors like oval cells, or putative progenitors like stellate cells that differentiate into albumin + cells [ 26 ], are unlikely to have undergone Ikk? deletion in regenerating liver or primary culture. Defined G0-culture conditions, which best simulate complex growth control processes free from confounding in vivo variables [ 27 ], should help clarify mechanisms by which Ikk? deletion confers growth advantages. Although in vitro measurements were consistent with in vivo results [ 7 ], which suggested that 70% PH shortened Ikk? ?hep hepatocyte St without affecting DNA-synthesis entry rates ( S ?), they were made in cells exposed to pre-plating stresses that induce early gene expression [ 28 ]. However, pre-plating artifacts like these or trace mitogens in the serum supplement are unlikely to have caused post-plating Ikk? ?hep hepatocyte growth advantages because ex vivo Ikk? deletion also stimulates Ikk? F/F hepatocyte proliferation. Future G0-culture investigations should also clarify whether Ikk? ?hep growth advantages result from signal-1 or -2 accelerated G0,1 ? G1 transitions with or without increased rates of S ? [ 14 , 29 ]. These investigations might be feasible with the culture system described here, which may have undergone G0-arrest as evident from stable plateau phases d8–d24, reduced cyclin D1 mRNA expression and near-baseline BrdU L.I. levels d8–d10. Our results show that increased sensitivities to mitogens, including increased expression of ECM, basement membrane, cytoskeletal and integrin mRNAs accompany increased Ikk? ?hep hepatocyte growth. TNF?-attenuated growth in Ikk? F/F and Ikk? ?hep cultures is consistent with TNF?-stimulated apoptosis at high (0.58 nM) but not low (0.058 nM) TNF? doses [ 6 ], suggesting that ligand interactions with TNFR2 may account for attenuated growth in high-dose TNF?-treated cells. In further agreement, biphasic dose-response curves of TNF?-stimulated AP-1 activation were also seen in transfected hepatocytes: AP-1 expression peaked at 0.01 nM and returned to basal levels at 1 nM [ 30 ]. Significant changes in the expression of Ikk? ?hep fibronectin, collagens I and III, nidogen, ?-actin and TGF?/EGF receptor-associated integrin B1 mRNAs were not seen in tissues or cells from which the cells were plated; instead 1–2d were required before Ikk? ?hep -associated elevations were observed. This suggests that regulatory effects of Ikk? deletion occurred post-plating after exposure to serum factors, to factors released by necrotic cells [ 10 ], and possibly to culture conditions like uncoated plastic used to preclude cell attachment bias. Further investigations are needed to determine how and if these signaling systems underlie the growth advantages of Ikk? ?hep hepatocytes.

(D) L.I. through mid-log phase: albumin + ( top curves) or BrdU + albumin + cells ( bottom curves); N = 6 dishes/point, 3 platings. (E) Ikk? ?hep S- and M-phase hepatocytes (200×): mitotic cells (?). (F) Augmented cyclin D1 expression. N = 8 dishes/point, 4 platings. Fig. 3 Ikk? deletion ex vivo stimulates cultured Ikk? F/F hepatocyte proliferation. (A) Growth and BrdU L.I. curves ( top and bottom panels, respectively; additions, ?). (B) Ad-Cre infection augments cyclin D1 and reduces IKK? mRNA expression ( top and bottom panels, respectively). Panels (A and B): N = 6 dishes/point, 3 platings. Fig. 4 Effects of Ikk? deletion on growth-signaling systems in cultured hepatocytes. (A) Heightened Ikk? ?hep sensitivity to mitogens. Duplicate wells of cells plated ( N 0 = 1.5 × 105) into 24-multiwell plates received serum-free plating medium (0-dose), TGF? ( top panel) or TNF? ( bottom panel). Curves are differences between the average AUC ± S.E[each treatment] minus the average AUC ± S.E[0-dose] integrated over d1–d9 cell counts. Average AUC values[0-dose] subtracted from each AUC[ligand dose] were 42026 ( Ikk? F/F) and 61023 ( Ikk? ?hep ; see Suppl. Table 3 ). Intergenotypic P values between curves: TGF?, P < 0.0005; TNF?, P < 0.03. (B) Augmented Ikk? ?hep cytoskeletal, ECM, basement membrane and integrin mRNA expression. Curves are averages, 3 platings ( N 0 = 3 × 105); N = 6 dishes/primer pair/point (sister culture growth was similar to Fig. 2A ). Primer pair results were combined ( Suppl. Table 1 ), except for nidogen ( N = 6 dishes/primer pair 1/point; N = 4 dishes, primer pair 2/point). Intergenotypic P values d0–d6: fibronectin ( P < 0.07); collagen I ( P < 0.003), collagen III ( P < 0.0003); nidogen ( P < 0.02); ?-actin ( P < 0.03); integrin B1 ( P < 0.0001).
