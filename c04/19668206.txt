A dual-emissive-materials design concept enables tumour hypoxia imaging Luminescent materials are widely used for imaging and sensing owing to their high sensitivity, rapid response and facile detection by many optical technologies 1 . Typically materials must be chemically tailored to achieve intense, photostable fluorescence, oxygen-sensitive phosphorescence or dual emission for ratiometric sensing, often by blending two dyes in a matrix. Dual-emissive materials combining all of these features in one easily tunable molecular platform are desirable, but when fluorescence and phosphorescence originate from the same dye, it can be challenging to vary relative fluorescence/phosphorescence intensities for practical sensing applications. Heavy-atom substitution 2 alone increases phosphorescence by a given, not variable amount. Here, we report a strategy for modulating fluorescence/phosphorescence for a single-component, dual-emissive, iodide-substituted difluoroboron dibenzoylmethane-poly(lactic acid) (BF2dbm(I)PLA) solid-state sensor material. This is accomplished through systematic variation of the PLA chain length in controlled solvent-free lactide polymerization 3 combined with heavy-atom substitution 2 . We demonstrate the versatility of this approach by showing that films made from low-molecular-weight BF2dbm(I)PLA with weak fluorescence and strong phosphorescence are promising as ‘turn on’ sensors for aerodynamics applications 4 , and that nanoparticles fabricated from a higher-molecular-weight polymer with balanced fluorescence and phosphorescence intensities serve as ratiometric tumour hypoxia imaging agents.  Methods Molecular weights were determined by gel permeation chromatography (tetrahydrofuran, 20 °C, 1.0 ml min?1) versus polystyrene standards on a Hewlett-Packard instrument (series 1100 HPLC) equipped with Polymer Laboratories 5 ?m mixed-C columns and connected to ultraviolet–visible and refractive index (Viscotek LR 40) detectors. A 0.58 correction factor was applied 23 , 24 . Data were processed with the OmniSEC software (version 4.2, Viscotek Corp). Ultraviolet–visible spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Photographs were taken in the dark using a Canon PowerShot SD600 Digital Elph camera with the automatic setting (no flash). Powders were analysed as precipitated. A Laurell Technologies WS-650S spin-coater was used to cast polymer films for luminescence measurements with the default set-up (30 s at a constant speed of 4,000 r.p.m.). Boron polymer films were spin-cast from CH2Cl2 solutions (~2.5% w/w) onto Fischer Scientific glass cover slides (22 × 22 mm) at a spin speed of 4,000 r.p.m. The coated slides were cut into ~3 mm × 22 mm strips, placed in a transparent glass vial under a N2 atmosphere and were sealed with Teflon caps for measurements. (Note: both borosilicate glass cover slides and glass vials are optically inactive using an excitation wavelength of greater than 368 nm.) Steady-state fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a Horiba Fluorolog-3 Model FL3-22 spectrofluorometer (double-grating excitation and double-grating emission monochromators). For all luminescence measurements, a Tiffen 55 mm 0.9 neutral density filter was placed in the path of the excitation source to protect the sample from photobleaching. RTP spectra were recorded with the same instrument except that a pulsed xenon lamp (?ex = 369 nm; duration < 1 ms) was used and spectra were collected with a 1 ms delay after excitation. Time-correlated single-photon counting fluorescence lifetime measurements were carried out with a NanoLED-370 (369 nm) excitation source and a DataStation Hub as the single-photon counting controller. Phosphorescence lifetimes were measured with a 500 ns multi channel scalar card excited with a pulsed xenon lamp (?ex = 369 nm; duration < 1 ms). Lifetime data were analysed with DataStation v2.4 software from Horiba Jobin Yvon. Fluorescence quantum yields, ? F, for BF2dbm(I)OH ( 1 ) and BF2dbm(I)PLA ( P1 – P3 ) in CH2Cl2 were calculated versus anthracene in ethanol as a standard, as previously described 25 using the following values: ? F anthracene = 0.27 (ref. 26 ), n D 20 ethanol = 1.360 , n D 20 CH 2 Cl 2 = 1.424 ; n D 20 is the refractive index (20 °C, yellow sodium D line, 589 nm). Optically dilute CH2Cl2 solutions of BF2dbm(I)OH and BF2dbm(I)PLA, and ethanol solutions of the anthracene standard were prepared in 1-cm-path-length quartz cuvettes, and absorbances ( A < 0.1) were recorded and steady-state emission spectra were obtained (?ex = 350 nm; emission integration range: 365–700 nm). For oxygen sensitivity and intensity-based Stern–Volmer plot measurements, gas mixtures of O2 and N2 of various concentrations were prepared by using two Cole-Parmer 65mm flow meters. For each concentration, the pre-mixed gas was passed through a 1-m-path quartz fluorometer cell equipped with a septum screw top containing the spin-cast P1 film for 15 min and then the spectrum was recorded. The oxygen sensitivity for the P2 nanoparticle aqueous suspension was calibrated similarly except that the pre-mixed gas was first evenly dispensed into a distilled-water chamber before passing through a quartz cell containing 1 ml of the optically dilute (abs < 0.1) sample. A window chamber was implanted using previously described techniques 22 . Briefly, the mouse was anaesthetized using an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg kg?1 ketamine, 10 mg kg?1 xylazine. The skin on the back of the animal was stretched into a metal frame to enable insertion of a titanium window frame, having a 12-mm-diameter window. The front face of the skin fold was excised, and approximately 20,000 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma cells were injected into the underlying fascia. A cover glass was placed over the open face of the window, and the tumour was allowed to incubate for 10 days before imaging. An approximately 100 ?l suspension of P2 nanoparticles (~1 mg ml?1) was injected into the space between the window chamber and the cover glass. Approximately 5 min passed between the injection and imaging, which allowed for stabilization of the signal. The animal was placed on an upright fluorescence microscope equipped with a DAPI excitation filter, and a liquid-crystal tunable emission filter (VariSpec, Cambridge Research and Instrumentation). This enabled acquisition of an emission spectrum, which was acquired in 10 nm intervals from 430 to 600 nm. Gas was administered by a nose cone at a rate of 5 l min?1, except for room air, during which the gas was shut off. The carbogen breathing was begun at the beginning of the experiment, with approximately 5 min passing before the initial acquisition. The gas was then switched to room air for a period of 3 min, and finally nitrogen for 30 s. The images shown in Fig. 3 were taken at the end of each respective period of gas breathing. Data were processed by taking the ratio of the fluorescence to phosphorescence signals, which were defined as the average signal acquired from 430 to 480 nm and 530 to 600 nm, respectively.
