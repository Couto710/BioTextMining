Early Outcomes After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation In Pediatric Patients With Hematologic Malignancies Following Single Fraction Total Body Irradiation Fractionated total body irradiation (FTBI) followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation results in donor engraftment and improves survival in children with high risk hematologic malignancies. However, acute toxicities (skin, lung, mucosa) are common after FTBI. Late complications include cataracts, endocrine dysfunction, sterility and impaired neurodevelopment. In lieu of FTBI, we used low-dose single fraction TBI (550 cGy) with cyclophosphamide as transplant conditioning for pediatric hematologic malignancies. Graft versus host disease prophylaxis included cyclosporine and short course methotrexate; methylprednisolone was added for unrelated donor transplants. Fifty-five children in first (40%) or second remission and beyond (60%) underwent transplantation from bone marrow (65%) or peripheral blood; 62% from unrelated donors; 22% were mismatched. Median follow-up was 18.5 months (1–68). Overall survival and disease-free survival at one year were 60% and 47% respectively. Acute toxicities included grade 3–4 mucositis (18%), invasive infections (11%), multiorgan failure/shock (11%), hemolytic anemia (7%), veno-occlusive disease (4%) and renal failure (4%). Treatment-related mortality was 11% at 100 days. Non-relapse mortality was 6% thereafter. Graft rejection occurred in 2%. Three patients (5%) died of GVHD. The regimen was well tolerated even in heavily pre-treated children and supported donor cell engraftment; long-term follow up is in progress.  Introduction Myeloablative conditioning using fractionated total body irradiation (FTBI) with alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or melphalan is successful in achieving engraftment of donor hematopoietic stem cells in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients and is a preferred transplant option especially in hematologic malignancies ( 1 ). Fractionation over several days enables the delivery of a high dose of radiation and eliminates both host hematopoiesis and malignant cells. However, acute toxicities such as mucositis, interstitial pneumonitis, veno-occlusive disease (VOD), nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are associated with FTBI resulting in significant morbidity and mortality especially in heavily pre-treated patients ( 2 ). Delayed toxicities of impaired growth and cognitive development, hormone insufficiency, cataracts, pulmonary fibrosis, and sterility are additional concerns especially in young children ( 3 – 5 ). The recognition of radiation-induced toxicities has resulted in the development of alternative preparative regimens using either high-dose chemotherapy combinations or immunosuppressive non-myeloablative agents ( 2 , 6 – 8 ). Unfortunately, alternative regimens that have avoided radiation are associated with higher rates of relapse and treatment failure when compared to FTBI based regimen, especially in lymphoid malignancies ( 8 , 9 ). High-dose chemotherapy containing regimens also result in organ dysfunction specific to the agents involved and contribute to transplant related morbidity and mortality ( 8 – 10 ). A lower total radiation dose can be effectively administered in a single fraction at a high dose rate to achieve myeloablation (SDTBI). Delivering radiation at a high dose rate in a single large fraction is presumed to have equivalent myelosuppressive effects as FTBI at lower dose rates. This approach resulted in lower incidence of organ toxicity and treatment-related mortality when tested in animal models ( 11 , 12 ). Successful transplant outcomes using a single fraction of 550 cGy were reported in adult transplant recipients with hematologic malignancies, myelodysplastic syndrome and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ( 13 – 16 ). In adults, treatment related mortality (TRM), engraftment and survival were similar or even superior to outcomes following FTBI. A similar conditioning strategy was adopted in 1998 for pediatric hematologic malignancies - acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We report transplant outcomes in 55 consecutive children less than 21 years of age that received matched related donor (MRD) or unrelated donor (URD) hematopoietic cell transplants (HCT) following SDTBI and cyclophosphamide between March 1998 and December 2005.  Patients and Methods Fifty-five consecutive children transplanted between March 1998 and January 2006 are reported. All provided signed consent for the transplant regimen. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . Two patients were undergoing a second HCT; one after a previous autologous transplant (BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside and melphalan conditioning) for relapsed Burkitt’s lymphoma six weeks prior to allogeneic HCT; the second with AML who relapsed after MRD HCT (busulfan and cyclophosphamide conditioning; stem cell source bone marrow) and underwent the second transplant 22 months later with MRD peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). Outcome measurements include overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), TRM, the incidence of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), engraftment and toxicities. Class I HLA antigens (A, B and C) were typed by serology until May 2000, by low-resolution molecular typing between June 2000 and October 2001, and subsequently by high-resolution typing. HLA-DRB1 alleles were typed by high-resolution in all patients. Of 36 URD donor/recipient pairs, 24 were matched at all 8/8 loci. Of 12 mismatched pairs (33%), 6 were mismatched at a single class I locus, 4 were mismatched at two class I loci, one was mismatched at three class I loci, and one was mismatched at a single class I and class II locus. Conditioning Regimen Conditioning included cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg intravenously (IV) on days ?3 and ?2 and SDTBI (550 cGy) on day ?1. SDTBI was delivered in parallel opposed lateral field with a 6-MV linear accelerator (Clinac 600 CD; Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). General anesthesia was used if necessary. Patients were treated in the seated-supine (“fetal”) position with a 300-cm source-to-midline distance. The point-of-dose prescription was a single point, midline in the body, at the level of the umbilicus. A large Lucite plate was placed in the beam near the patient to increase the superficial dose and a missing tissue compensator was used to keep the midline dose to the head and neck to within 110% of the prescription dose. The lateral position of the arms provided partial lung shielding. No additional lung shielding was used. Both ion chamber and diodes placed on different parts of the body were used to ensure that the measured and calculated doses were within acceptable limits. The median actual dose rate was 31.6 cGy/min (range 27–38.1). Twelve patients were treated with a fractionated external beam “boost” in the few days prior to TBI. Of these, 3 patients were treated with cranial irradiation (800–900 cGy), and 7 with craniospinal irradiation (cranial 800–1260 cGy, spinal 540–1260 cGy) for CNS leukemia. Two patients with testicular disease were treated with 1000–1260 cGy boost to this region. Cell Dose Graft details are outlined in Table 1 . The median total nucleated cells (TNC) infused was 4.3×108 per kg recipient weight (range 1.4–41.2). The median number of CD34+ cells infused was 3.8×106 per kg recipient weight (range 1.3–44.7). PBSC when used, were collected after either granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) (n=15) or a combination of GCSF and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) (n=4) according to a separate study. All BM and PBSC products were infused fresh and without manipulation. Graft Versus Host Disease Prophylaxis GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine A (CsA) and short course methotrexate (3 doses). Methylprednisolone was added for URD HCT recipients. CsA levels were maintained between 250–350 ng/mL until taper between day +100 and +180 in the absence of GVHD. Methotrexate was administered IV at 10 mg/m2 on day +1 and 7.5 mg/m2 on days +3 and +6. Methylprednisolone or an oral equivalent was administered at 1 mg/kg/day between days +7 and +28 and weaned between days +28 and +54 in the absence of GVHD. Supportive Care GCSF 5 mcg/kg/day was administered between day +7 and recovery of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (?1500/µL × 2). CMV seronegative blood products were administered in CMV seronegative recipients. Seropositivity for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and/or herpes simplex virus (HSV) was treated with acyclovir 750 mg/m2/day for 6 months. Ampicillin prophylaxis was administered IV until neutrophil engraftment unless broad spectrum antibiotics were indicated. Fluconazole prophylaxis was administered until day +75. All patients received prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci , with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 1 year or until withdrawal of immunosuppression. Blood was tested for CMV reactivation (PCR or shell-vial culture) weekly after neutrophil engraftment until day +100. Outcome measurements Neutrophil and platelet engraftment were the first of three consecutive days in which the ANC was greater than 500/µL and platelet count greater than 20,000/µL occurring at least seven days after the most recent platelet transfusion respectively. Donor cell enraftment was determined by short tandem-repeat (STR) polymorphisms. Full donor chimerism was ?90% of marrow cells. Between 10–90% donor cells were termed mixed chimerism. In the absence of disease relapse, graft rejection (GR) was defined as the failure to achieve an ANC >500/µL or <10% donor cells ?45 days post transplant. Acute and chronic GVHD were graded according to previously published criteria ( 17 , 18 ). Mucositis grading was performed according to previously published criteria ( 19 ). Total parenteral nutrition was administered only to patients with grade IV mucositis and not used prophylactically. Organ toxicities were recorded based on physical examination and laboratory criteria. Relapse was defined as >25% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the number of days between HCT and relapse. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was death in the absence of relapse <100 days post- HCT. Non-relapse mortality was >100 days after HCT. Basic immune reconstitution was determined by peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulation analysis by flow cytometry and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis at days +100 (N=20), +180 (N=9) and +365 (N=9). Lymphocyte subpopulations are reported as absolute numbers and PHA-induced stimulation index as a percentage of normal control.  Conditioning Regimen Conditioning included cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg intravenously (IV) on days ?3 and ?2 and SDTBI (550 cGy) on day ?1.

Lymphocyte subpopulations are reported as absolute numbers and PHA-induced stimulation index as a percentage of normal control.  Results Outcomes are reported following mean and median follow-up times post-transplant of 23.2 and 18.5 months respectively (range 4–68 months). Twenty-three (42%) patients were followed for ?24 months. Engraftment and Chimerism The median inpatient stay for all patients was 19 days (range 17–66). The cumulative incidence of neutrophil and platelet engraftment, and donor chimerism at days +100 and +365 are listed in Table 2 . At day +100, 85% of evaluated patients had full donor chimerism, 9% had mixed chimerism. Of the five patients with mixed chimerism, four (2 with ALL, 2 with AML; 2 MRD, 2 matched URD) relapsed between day +118 and +218 and died. The fifth patient with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL remains in remission and has 100% donor chimerism 1 year after one donor lymphocyte infusion. Of four additional patients who failed to engraft neutrophils, one patient had GR (2%); three others died within 30 days prior to engraftment. The single patient with graft rejection was transplanted for ALL in third remission with a mismatched URD bone marrow product. This patient subsequently relapsed 100 days post-transplant and died of disease. On day +365, all patients tested (N=24) had full donor chimerism. Transplant Related Toxicities Of 31 deaths, 18 (58%) died of relapsed disease. Thirteen died of non-relapse causes. Three patients died prior to neutrophil engraftment; the first with AML in CR2 died on day +19 with refractory VOD. The second also with AML in CR2 expired on day +13 following initial renal and subsequently multiorgan failure. Though aspergillosis and HSV infection were pre-transplant complications, no infectious etiology was identified post-transplant. The third patient with acute undifferentiated hypodiploid leukemia in CR1 died on day +30 of candida infection. Four patients died between day between day +67 and +730 of GVHD and related complications. All 4 developed gut involvement; 3 of 4 also developed fungal infection that contributed to death. One patient who was lost to follow-up died of an undetermined cause. Four patients died of late infections after day +100 (day 100–1227). Organisms included mucor mycosis, Pneumocystis jiroveci, Paecilomyces variotii + candida glabrata and BK virus + CMV + streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia/meningitis . One child transplanted for Burkitts lymphoma subsequently developed Hodgkins lymphoma 3 years later and died of infection three weeks after reinduction chemotherapy. Despite being a heavily pre-treated group of transplant recipients, only 9 (16%) developed grade III mucositis and 1 (2%) developed grade IV mucositis. Non-fatal infectious complications included gram-negative bacteremia (4%), mycobacterial bacteremia (2%), candidemia (5%) and CMV reactivation (9%) between 14 and 100 days post-transplant. Non-fatal organ toxicities included veno-occlusive disease in 2 (4%), infection induced organ dysfunction in 6 (11%) and hemolytic anemia in 4 (7%). No patient developed primary radiation induced acute pneumonitis. GVHD The cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GVHD is shown in Table 2 . Of the 27% of patients with grade II–IV acute GVHD, the majority (87%) had received an URD transplant. The most common grade/site was ? grade III acute GVHD of the GI tract (n=9). One patient had grade IV GVHD which involved the liver. Of 40% of patients who developed chronic GVHD, 77% had received URD HCT. The skin and GI tract were affected most frequently. One patient with biopsy-proven severe, extensive chronic GVHD of the skin and GI tract went on to develop bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia diagnosed by open lung biopsy 139 days post-transplant. Chronic GVHD is attributable to both the use of PBSC as a stem cell source and the acceptance of HLA mismatched donors in this series. Immune Reconstitution Table 3 demonstrates that lymphocyte subpopulations and function returned to normal values by day 365 post-transplant. OS, DFS and TRM Overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort was 44% (24 of 55) with a median survival time of 757 days. For recipients in CR1 or CR2 at the time of transplant, OS at one year was 63% (95% CI: 48–075) for lymphoid malignancies (pre-B ALL, pre-T ALL, PTCL, Burkitt’s lymphoma, T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, biphenotypic leukemia). Cumulative DFS was 51% (36–64) and TRM was 14% (6–27). OS for patients receiving URD and MRD stem cells was 90% (66–97) and 53% (23–75), respectively ( Figure 1A ). DFS at 1 year for URD and MRD transplants was 70% (45–85) and 46% (19–70) respectively ( Figure 1B ). TRM for URD and MRD transplants was 15% (4–43) and 5% (1–24) respectively ( Figure 1C ). There was no statistical difference in survival between URD and MRD HCT recipients ( Figure 1 ). Sixteen patients with AML were in CR1 or CR2. For patients with AML, OS was 38% (15–60%), DFS was 31% (11–54%) and TRM was 25% (7–52%) in this heavily pretreated population. Five patients were in CR3 (lymphoid malignancies) and one (AML) in partial remission (PR) ( Table 1 ) at the time of HCT. Despite intense therapy prior to transplant, all tolerated the conditioning regimen well. Four of the five patients in CR3 engrafted neutrophils and platelets and three remained engrafted 365 days post-transplant. All four however, eventually died of relapse between 122 and 801 days post transplant. One patient died of multiorgan failure of unclear etiology one year after HCT and had no detectable malignancy or GVHD at the time of death. The patient with AML in partial remission relapsed at day 30 and expired on day 39 without donor engraftment. Median survival time was not statistically different between URD and MRD subgroups (641 vs. 811 days) ( P =0.52). Of the 24 survivors, 8 (33%) received PBSC and 16 (67%) received bone marrow transplants. This difference is similar to the overall percentage difference in the utilization of each type of product within the cohort and we were unable to detect a survival advantage based on stem cell source. The overall relapse rate for patients in CR1 and CR2 was 33% with a median time to relapse of 109 days (range 62–350 days). When divided between lymphoid and AML subgroups: 33% of patients with lymphoid malignancies relapsed at a median of 96 days (range 62–350); 31% of patients with myeloid malignancies relapsed at a median of 129 days (range 68–179).  Results Outcomes are reported following mean and median follow-up times post-transplant of 23.2 and 18.5 months respectively (range 4–68 months).

DFS at 1 year for URD and MRD transplants was 70% (45–85) and 46% (19–70) respectively ( Figure 1B ). TRM for URD and MRD transplants was 15% (4–43) and 5% (1–24) respectively ( Figure 1C ). There was no statistical difference in survival between URD and MRD HCT recipients ( Figure 1 ). Sixteen patients with AML were in CR1 or CR2.

The third patient with acute undifferentiated hypodiploid leukemia in CR1 died on day +30 of candida infection. Four patients died between day between day +67 and +730 of GVHD and related complications. All 4 developed gut involvement; 3 of 4 also developed fungal infection that contributed to death. One patient who was lost to follow-up died of an undetermined cause. Four patients died of late infections after day +100 (day 100–1227). Organisms included mucor mycosis, Pneumocystis jiroveci, Paecilomyces variotii + candida glabrata and BK virus + CMV + streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia/meningitis . One child transplanted for Burkitts lymphoma subsequently developed Hodgkins lymphoma 3 years later and died of infection three weeks after reinduction chemotherapy. Despite being a heavily pre-treated group of transplant recipients, only 9 (16%) developed grade III mucositis and 1 (2%) developed grade IV mucositis. Non-fatal infectious complications included gram-negative bacteremia (4%), mycobacterial bacteremia (2%), candidemia (5%) and CMV reactivation (9%) between 14 and 100 days post-transplant. Non-fatal organ toxicities included veno-occlusive disease in 2 (4%), infection induced organ dysfunction in 6 (11%) and hemolytic anemia in 4 (7%). No patient developed primary radiation induced acute pneumonitis.  Transplant Related Toxicities Of 31 deaths, 18 (58%) died of relapsed disease. Thirteen died of non-relapse causes. Three patients died prior to neutrophil engraftment; the first with AML in CR2 died on day +19 with refractory VOD. The second also with AML in CR2 expired on day +13 following initial renal and subsequently multiorgan failure.

No patient developed primary radiation induced acute pneumonitis.  GVHD The cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GVHD is shown in Table 2 . Of the 27% of patients with grade II–IV acute GVHD, the majority (87%) had received an URD transplant. The most common grade/site was ? grade III acute GVHD of the GI tract (n=9). One patient had grade IV GVHD which involved the liver. Of 40% of patients who developed chronic GVHD, 77% had received URD HCT. The skin and GI tract were affected most frequently. One patient with biopsy-proven severe, extensive chronic GVHD of the skin and GI tract went on to develop bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia diagnosed by open lung biopsy 139 days post-transplant. Chronic GVHD is attributable to both the use of PBSC as a stem cell source and the acceptance of HLA mismatched donors in this series.

OS, DFS and TRM Overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort was 44% (24 of 55) with a median survival time of 757 days. For recipients in CR1 or CR2 at the time of transplant, OS at one year was 63% (95% CI: 48–075) for lymphoid malignancies (pre-B ALL, pre-T ALL, PTCL, Burkitt’s lymphoma, T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, biphenotypic leukemia). Cumulative DFS was 51% (36–64) and TRM was 14% (6–27). OS for patients receiving URD and MRD stem cells was 90% (66–97) and 53% (23–75), respectively ( Figure 1A ). DFS at 1 year for URD and MRD transplants was 70% (45–85) and 46% (19–70) respectively ( Figure 1B ). TRM for URD and MRD transplants was 15% (4–43) and 5% (1–24) respectively ( Figure 1C ). There was no statistical difference in survival between URD and MRD HCT recipients ( Figure 1 ). Sixteen patients with AML were in CR1 or CR2. For patients with AML, OS was 38% (15–60%), DFS was 31% (11–54%) and TRM was 25% (7–52%) in this heavily pretreated population. Five patients were in CR3 (lymphoid malignancies) and one (AML) in partial remission (PR) ( Table 1 ) at the time of HCT. Despite intense therapy prior to transplant, all tolerated the conditioning regimen well. Four of the five patients in CR3 engrafted neutrophils and platelets and three remained engrafted 365 days post-transplant. All four however, eventually died of relapse between 122 and 801 days post transplant. One patient died of multiorgan failure of unclear etiology one year after HCT and had no detectable malignancy or GVHD at the time of death. The patient with AML in partial remission relapsed at day 30 and expired on day 39 without donor engraftment. Median survival time was not statistically different between URD and MRD subgroups (641 vs. 811 days) ( P =0.52). Of the 24 survivors, 8 (33%) received PBSC and 16 (67%) received bone marrow transplants. This difference is similar to the overall percentage difference in the utilization of each type of product within the cohort and we were unable to detect a survival advantage based on stem cell source. The overall relapse rate for patients in CR1 and CR2 was 33% with a median time to relapse of 109 days (range 62–350 days). When divided between lymphoid and AML subgroups: 33% of patients with lymphoid malignancies relapsed at a median of 96 days (range 62–350); 31% of patients with myeloid malignancies relapsed at a median of 129 days (range 68–179).

Discussion This report is a retrospective analysis of outcomes of allogeneic HCT in children with acute hematologic malignancies using a novel myeloablative conditioning strategy of a low total single fraction (550 cGy) total body irradiation combined with cyclophosphamide. This method of radiation was adopted in an effort to increase tolerability of the regimen. The duration of conditioning was shortened significantly to only 3 days with this strategy. Our group had previously reported that this strategy was well tolerated, and had good outcomes in adult patients with malignant disorders ( 13 – 16 ). The conditioning regimen supported engraftment of PBSC and BM cells and full donor chimerism was present at day +100 in 85% of evaluated recipients (30% MRD and 55% URD). This is comparable with adult recipients that received similar conditioning using MRD for CML or best available donor for hematologic malignancies where complete donor chimerism was present on day +100 in 92% and 76%, respectively. Time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment (13 and 18 days respectively) were also similar to that reported in adult patients undergoing similar conditioning (11 and 14 days respectively) ( 13 , 16 ). URD HCT (62%) was performed more frequently than MRD HCT, 22% received HLA mismatched transplants. The majority were patients in CR2 (51%) or CR3 (9%). Despite extensive prior chemotherapy +/? cranial/craniospinal irradiation (10 patients), this regimen was tolerated well. A distinct advantage to administering radiation in a single fraction was a reduction in the number of days of conditioning and sedation often required for FTBI in children. The incidence of severe mucositis was low (16%) as were early invasive infections (11%). No acute pulmonary toxicity was encountered after radiation in contrast to reports of pulmonary toxicity with standard TBI-based regimens ( 19 – 21 ). The incidence of liver toxicity (VOD) was low (4%); none was fatal. No patient developed hemorrhagic cystitis. However, late complications of myeloablative preparative regimen targeting growth, fertility, endocrine function, cataracts, neurodevelopment and the risk of second malignancies are of special concern in pediatric recipients and are reported with both TBI and busulfan based regimens ( 2 – 5 , 9 ). While no late complications are apparent to date, the follow up period is too short, and long-term effects after SDTBI will need to be determined. Of particular interest are growth, endocrine function, neurocognitive development and fertility. The toxicity profile and ease of administration of the conditioning regimen make this approach an attractive option in children. Survival was better for children with lymphoid malignancies than those with myeloid cancers. Previously reported outcomes following allogeneic transplantation for pediatric hematologic malignancies are listed in Table 4 for comparison. Children undergoing HCT from unrelated donors for hematologic malignancies have a OS of 47–51% and a DFS of 43–51% ( 22 ). Retrospective studies comparing the efficacy of busulfan and cyclophosphamide (Bu/CY) and FTBI/CY conditioning in pediatric patients with ALL suggest that TBI-based regimens had better outcomes than chemotherapy alone ( 23 – 26 ). Bu/CY-containing regimens were also associated with a higher incidence of death due to systemic infection, interstitial pneumonitis and VOD ( 8 ). Standard myeloablative HCT for ALL has an OS of 39–68%, DFS of 31–58% and TRM of 9–31% ( 8 – 10 , 23 , 27 ). Our survival rates were comparable with SDTBI. TRM for lymphoid malignancies was 15% in URD HCT and 5% in MRD HCT. Patients with lymphoid malignancies undergoing URD HCT in CR1 or CR2 had a one year OS of 90% while similar patients undergoing MRD HCT had a one year OS of 53%. The DFS was similarly 68% and 46% in URD and MRD HCT, respectively. Due to wide confidence intervals, this was not of statistical significance and can just be described as a trend. However, similar results are described by Gassas et al with an attribution to a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect ( 28 ). In children with AML, outcomes are similar following Bu/CY and TBI/CY based conditioning when the total dose of cyclophosphamide combined with busulfan was 200 mg/kg ( 29 ). Previous reports describe a DFS of 51% in CR2 and 38% TRM for AML and URD transplants ( 23 , 25 , 30 ). The DFS for AML patients in our group the majority of which were URD transplants was 31% and TRM was 33%. The morbidity of transplant is exacerbated by intensity of previous therapies and pediatric protocols for AML therapy are dose intensive. Transplant timing and approach for AML need further optimization and the SDTBI approach seems comparable to other transplant methods with room for improvement ( 31 ). For all patients, the OS following SDTBI-based conditioning was 44% with a median survival time of 757 days. Previously described GVHD rates are 30% for grade 2–4 acute and 40% for chronic in children ( 32 ). Grade 2–4 acute GVHD developed in 26% of our patients and resulted in 3 deaths (5%) despite URD HCT and mismatched transplants ( Table 1 ). These findings compare favorably to a GVHD-related mortality of 10% for FTBI/CY and 11% for Bu/CY in children receiving MRD HCT8 and a 26% incidence of acute GVHD following MRD HCT in children ( 9 ). Grade 3–4 acute GVHD was 18% in our patient cohort. Extensive chronic GVHD developed in 27% of patients. GVHD rates are similar for acute GVHD and lower for cGVHD when compared with adult patients transplanted using this regimen ( 13 , 16 ). This may be attributed to patient age and stem cell source differences. In conclusion, SDTBI was easy to administer, well tolerated, and resulted in successful donor cell engraftment in patients receiving MRD or URD HCT. Early transplant outcomes were comparable to pediatric patients receiving classic myeloablative conditioning and were better for lymphoid malignancies than for the myeloid group. The incidence of GVHD was comparable despite HLA mismatching. The advantages of delivering SDTBI included shortened conditioning time (3 days), easy delivery, early neutrophil recovery, and consequently a shorter period of hospitalization that could translate into lowered in-patient hospitalization costs. The single fraction of radiation was technically easier to deliver and simplified anesthesia requirements in the young. The incidence of early toxicities such as mucositis and interstitial pneumonitis were low despite a heavily pre-treated population and the preponderance of URD HCT. These observations make SDTBI an attractive option for pediatric transplant recipients, especially in lymphoid malignancies where radiation therapy based conditioning is likely to provide benefit. Longer follow up as well as a prospective comparison between fractionated and SD TBI is necessary to better define late outcomes. Follow up studies are in progress to determine late outcomes and side effects of this regimen.
