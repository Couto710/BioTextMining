VEGFR1-activity-independent metastasis formation  METHODS Flt1 TK?/?/C57BL (re-derived from flt1 TK?/? mice 10 , 12 , kindly provided by M. Shibuya, Univ. Tokyo) and Actb-GFP/C57BL mice (Jackson Labs), C57BL mouse-syngeneic LLC1 lung carcinoma (CRL-1642) and B16 melanoma cell lines (CRL-6323)(both ATCC), the BMT and spontaneous metastasis formation models, and confocal microscopy and flow cytometric analyses have been previously described 5 , 10 , 12 . We used Matlab software for quantification. Rat anti-VEGFR1 monoclonal antibody (MF1, a gift from ImClone Systems) or IgG (Jackson Labs) was administered intraperitoneally (20 or 40 mg kg?1) to tumour-bearing mice three times per week 13 . We used Alexa-Fluor-647 (Molecular Probes)-labelled MF1 for flow cytometry. All other antibodies were purchased from BD-Pharmingen.  Figure and Table Figure 1 Effect of blocking VEGFR1 activity on BMDC accumulation in tumours and metastatic lung tissues The number of BMDCs was calculated as ratio of GFP-surface area to DAPI-surface area (± s.e.m.). DAPI was used to stain the nuclei of all cells ( n = 6–8 mice per group).* P < 0.05.

P values were calculated with a Student’s t -test and showed no significant difference. In addition, rank comparisons with the Mann–Whitney U -test showed no significant differences
