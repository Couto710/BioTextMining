Failure of antithrombotic therapy and risk of stroke in patients with Symptomatic Intracranial Stenosis Background and Purpose We sought to determine if patients with intracranial stenosis who have a TIA or stroke on antithrombotic therapy are at particularly high risk for recurrent stroke. Methods We compared baseline features and the rates of stroke or vascular death and stroke in the territory of the symptomatic artery between patients ON (n=299) vs. OFF (n=269) antithrombotics at the time of their qualifying event for the Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial. Results In univariate analyses, there was no difference in the rates of stroke or vascular death (21 vs. 23%, HR (ON/OFF) = 0.91 (95%CI: 0.64–1.29), p= 0.59) or stroke in territory (13 vs. 14%, HR (ON/OFF) = 0.90 (95%CI: 0.57–1.39), p=0.61) between patients ON vs. OFF antithrombotics at the time of their qualifying event. A multivariable analysis adjusted for the difference in risk factors between patients ON and OFF antithrombotic therapy also showed no significant differences in the combined endpoint of stroke or vascular death (HR (ON/OFF) = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.55–1.34, p=0.51) or stroke in territory (HR (ON/OFF) = 1.01., 95%CI: 0.58–1.77, p=0.97) between patients ON vs. OFF antithrombotic therapy at the time of qualifying event. Conclusions Intracranial stenosis patients who fail antithrombotic therapy are not at higher risk of stroke than those who do not fail antithrombotic therapy. Given our finding that patients ON and OFF antithrombotic therapy are both at high risk for stroke in the territory, intracranial stenting trials should not be limited to just those who fail antithrombotic therapy.

Methods Patient Entrance Criteria Data on the 569 patients enrolled in the Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial were used for this post-hoc analysis. Details of the WASID study design have been published previously 4 . In brief, WASID was a randomized, double-blinded, multi-center clinical trial designed to compare the efficacy of dose-adjusted warfarin (target INR 2–3) vs. aspirin 1300 mg for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis. Inclusion criteria included TIA or stroke that occurred within 90 days before randomization (considered the qualifying event) which was attributable to angiographically proven 50 to 99 percent stenosis of a major intracranial artery (internal carotid, middle cerebral, vertebral, or basilar), a modified Rankin score of 3 or less (indicating a non-disabling stroke), and age greater or equal to 40 years. Exclusion criteria included tandem 50 to 99 percent stenosis of the extracranial carotid artery, non-atherosclerotic stenosis of an intracranial artery, a cardiac source of embolism, and a contraindication to aspirin or warfarin therapy. Definitions of ON vs. OFF antithrombotic therapy For the purpose of these analyses, patients were considered to be ON antithrombotic therapy if they reported taking an antiplatelet agent or warfarin at the time of their qualifying event for WASID. Patients were OFF antithrombotic therapy if they reported taking no antiplatelet agent or warfarin at the time of their qualifying event for WASID. The reason for antithrombotic use at the time of the qualifying event for WASID was not recorded. Endpoints The outcome variables used in these analyses were the same as those in the primary paper 2 : the combined endpoint of stroke or vascular death (primary endpoint), stroke in the territory of the stenotic artery (secondary endpoint), and major hemorrhage (safety endpoint). Statistical Methods In an effort to determine if patients deemed “antithrombotic failures” had worse outcomes in WASID, baseline features and vascular endpoints (rates of stroke or vascular death, ischemic stroke in the territory of the stenotic artery, and major hemorrhage) were compared between patients ON versus OFF antithrombotic therapies at the time of the qualifying event in univariate and multivariable analyses. Baseline features of the two groups were compared using either an independent groups t-test (for means) or chi-square test (for percentages). The cumulative probability of an event versus time was estimated using the product-limit method and was compared between the treatment groups using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate both unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (ON/OFF). The Supremum tests confirmed the proportional hazards assumptions 5 . Hazard ratios were adjusted for baseline factors which were found to differ between the groups, as listed in Table 1 , except for LDL which was not included because of missing data. With the sample size in WASID, there was 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 1.65 for stroke or vascular death and 1.89 for stroke in territory for patients ON vs. OFF antithrombotic therapy at the time of the qualifying event. As an additional exploratory analysis, we compared the outcomes of patients on an antiplatelet agent at the time of the qualifying event who were subsequently randomized to aspirin or warfarin, in an effort to determine if warfarin is an effective “rescue therapy”. Similar time to event methods were used for these analyses. Hazard ratios for these analyses are presented as aspirin/warfarin (A/W) ratios. There was 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 2.16 for stroke or vascular death and 2.65 for stroke in territory for patients on aspirin vs. warfarin. An interaction term was added to the Cox proportional hazards regression models in order to test the interaction between the use of antithrombotic therapy at qualifying event (ON vs. OFF) and treatment assignment (warfarin vs. aspirin).

Results Baseline Features At the time of their qualifying event for WASID, 299 patients were ON antithrombotic therapy (260 on antiplatelet and 39 on anticoagulation) and 269 were OFF antithrombotic therapy. The baseline characteristics of patients ON vs. OFF antithrombotic medication at the time of the qualifying event are listed in Table 1 . Compared to patients OFF antithrombotic therapy at the time of their qualifying event, patients ON antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelets or anticoagulants) were significantly more likely to be older, white, or have a history of a prior stroke, hypertension, lipid disorder, coronary artery disease, and tobacco use. Patients ON antithrombotic therapy were also significantly more likely to be on a statin and had a lower LDL at the time of the qualifying event. Patients OFF antithrombotic therapies at the time of their qualifying event were more likely to be black, have stroke as their qualifying event, and have a higher frequency of MCA stenosis. Endpoints in patients ON vs. OFF antithrombotic therapy Comparison of outcomes between patients ON vs. OFF antithrombotic therapy revealed no significant differences in the percentage of patients with the combined endpoint stroke or vascular death (21 vs. 23%, HR (ON/OFF) = 0.91 (95%CI: 0.64–1.29), p= 0.59) or stroke in territory (13 vs. 14%, HR (ON/OFF) = 0.90 (95%CI: 0.57–1.39), p=0.61) in the univariate analyses, as shown in Table 2 . A multivariable analysis adjusted for the difference in risk factors between patients ON and OFF antithrombotic therapy also showed no significant differences in the combined endpoint of stroke or vascular death (HR (ON/OFF) = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.55–1.34, p=0.51) or stroke in territory (HR (ON/OFF) = 1.01., 95%CI: 0.58–1.77, p=0.97) between patients ON vs. OFF antithrombotic therapy at the time of qualifying event. Patients ON vs. OFF antithrombotic therapy did not significantly differ with respect to the percentage of major hemorrhage during follow-up (6.7 vs. 4.8%, HR (ON/OFF) = 1.32 (95%CI: 0.66–2.65), p=0.44). Patients OFF antithrombotic therapy Among patients who were OFF antithrombotic therapy at the time of their qualifying event, there was no difference between those randomized to aspirin or warfarin for the endpoints of stroke or vascular death or stroke in territory, as shown in Table 3 . Patients ON antithrombotic therapy Forty-six percent of patients in WASID were on an antiplatelet agent at the time of their qualifying event. Among these patients, 129 were randomized to aspirin and 134 were randomized to warfarin. There was no significant difference in the rate of stroke or vascular death in the patients randomized to aspirin vs. warfarin, as shown in Table 3 . However, there was a trend toward a lower rate of stroke in the territory in warfarin arm (9%) than the aspirin arm (17%) (p=0.07). Although not statistically significant, the direction of the difference between aspirin and warfarin was in favor of aspirin for patients OFF antithrombotic therapy at the time of qualifying event and in favor of warfarin for patient ON antithrombotic therapy. The interaction between use of antithrombotic therapy at qualifying event and treatment assignment was not statistically significant for either stroke or vascular death (p=0.13) or stroke in territory (p=0.10).

Conclusion The results of this post-hoc analysis of the WASID dataset do not support the commonly held belief that patients with intracranial stenosis who present with TIA or stroke while on antithrombotic therapy are at particularly high risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. In patients enrolled in WASID who were on an antithrombotic agent at the time of their qualifying event, we could not detect an increased risk of either the combined endpoint (stroke or vascular death) or stroke in the territory compared to those who were not previously on antithrombotic agents. In contrast, the WARSS 6 trial, a multi-center secondary prevention stroke trial with over 2000 patients, found that the rates of recurrent stroke and death in patients who were on antithrombotic therapy at the time of the qualifying event were higher during the study than those who were ‘naïve’ to antithrombotics at the start of the trial 7 . WARSS differed from WASID in that WARSS included patients with heterogeneous causes of stroke whereas WASID was limited to patients with intracranial stenosis. Their finding that stroke patients who ‘fail medical therapy’ are at higher risk than those who are not ‘medical failures’ raises the possibility that intracranial stenosis may be such a high risk condition that antithrombotic therapy has relatively little impact on recurrent events. We found the 1-year rate of stroke or vascular death to be 15% (2-year rate 21%) in patients who were on antithrombotic therapy at the time of their qualifying event. A previous retrospective single center study 3 of 52 patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis reported a substantially higher risk of recurrent events in patients on antithrombotic therapy compared to our study. However the high recurrent event rate in their report was due in part to the inclusion of TIA as an endpoint. In addition, patients with intracranial stenosis referred for evaluation at this major tertiary referral center may be a particularly high-risk cohort. On the other hand, referral bias might have also affected the WASID cohort, as some patients perceived to be particularly high risk (i.e. those who had failed antithrombotic therapy, particularly warfarin) might not have been referred for enrollment into WASID and therefore the risk of recurrent events in patients ‘ON’ antithrombotics in our study might be an underestimate. Nevertheless, the WASID database used for this analysis is the largest multi-center cohort of patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis and therefore may provide a better estimate of the true event rates in this population. We did find significant differences in baseline features between patients ON vs. OFF antithrombotic therapies at the time of enrollment in WASID. Many of these differences in baseline features are explained by the fact that older patients with multiple risk factors and a history of CAD or stroke would be expected to be put on an antiplatelet agent and statin. In addition, patients on antithrombotic therapy were more likely to have a TIA rather than a stroke as their qualifying event. The lower rate of stroke as a qualifying event in patients on antithrombotic therapy may be due to the ability of antithrombotic agents (both antiplatelets and anticoagulants) to prevent the progression from TIA to stroke in some patients. Despite the differences in baseline features between patients ON vs. OFF antithrombotic therapy at baseline, there was no difference in outcome between these groups in multivariable analyses which took the differences in baseline features between the two groups into account. In our exploratory analysis, we did not find strong evidence to support the theory that warfarin might be an effective “rescue therapy” in patients with intracranial stenosis who have stroke symptoms while on antiplatelet agents. When analyzing the subset of WASID patients on antiplatelet agents at the time of their qualifying event, we found no difference in the rate of stroke or vascular death (the primary endpoint in WASID) between patients randomized to warfarin vs. aspirin. There was a trend toward lower rates of stroke in the territory for patients previously on antiplatelets that were randomized to warfarin compared to aspirin. However, we did not find an interaction between prior treatment with antiplatelets and treatment assignment in WASID, although there was limited power to detect such an interaction. Our findings are consistent with data from WARSS which also demonstrated that in patients on antithrombotic agents at the time of their qualifying event, warfarin was no better than aspirin for prevention of recurrent stroke during the trial 7 . While the limited power of this WASID analysis prevents a definitive conclusion regarding the efficacy of warfarin as a “rescue therapy”, the higher rates of major hemorrhage associated with warfarin use in WASID 2 combined with our finding that patients previously on antithrombotic agents had a slightly higher (not significant) increase in major hemorrhage during follow-up when on warfarin likely outweighs any potential benefit of warfarin in this population. Our findings that “medical failures” are not at higher risk of stroke has several implications for current and future treatment of patients with intracranial stenosis. Since stroke rates on aspirin are high and warfarin is not established as a safe and effective “rescue treatment”, other methods of stroke prevention, such as intracranial stenting, need to be evaluated in clinical trials. Currently, endovascular treatment with the Wingspan intracranial stent is available under a FDA humanitarian device exemption (HDE) for patients with 50–99% stenosis who have failed medical therapy 8 . Given our finding that “medical failures” are not at higher risk for stroke in the territory than other patients, intracranial stenting trials should not be limited to those who fail medical therapy. Instead, future studies comparing intracranial stenting to medical therapy should focus on other high-risk features for stroke in territory, such as severe stenosis and recent symptoms 9 .
