UROLOGIC DISEASE BURDEN IN THE UNITED STATES: VETERAN USERS OF VA HEALTH CARE Objectives To determine the disease burden, measured by resource utilization, of four urologic conditions among veteran users of VA health care services and to assess variations by selected socio-demographic characteristics. Methods We applied expert-derived diagnosis clusters to establish four patient cohorts from a population of U.S. veterans age 18 and older with at least 1 outpatient visit in a VA health care facility in Fiscal year 2001 (n=3,691,519): (1) benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms (BPH/LUTS), (2) kidney stones (KS), (3) urinary tract infections (UTI), and (4) urinary incontinence (UI). We identified patients with qualifying diagnosis codes associated with outpatient visits in the national VA Outpatient Clinic file thereby generating case counts for each diagnostic category. Results Among veteran users of VA health care services, when defined as the primary reason for the visit, the prevalence of BPH/LUTS was 4,811 per 100,000 veterans (4.8%); the prevalence of KS was 597 per 100,000 (0.6%); the prevalence of UTI was 4,265 and 1,719 per 100,000 female and male veterans, respectively (4.3% and 1.7%); and the prevalence of UI was 2,161 and 515 per 100,000 female and male veterans, respectively (2.2% and 0.5%). Prevalence of these conditions when ascertained by capturing diagnoses appearing as secondary reasons for a physician visit was much higher. Conclusions Although we expected the prevalence of urologic conditions to be high among veterans who use the VA system for care, we found the burden of urologic disease among veterans to be comparable to other national data sets. Prevalence estimates based on primary diagnosis, rather than secondary or “any” diagnosis, significantly underestimated the disease burden among veterans.  MATERIALS & METHODS Institutional Review Board approval was obtained through UCLA and the Sepulveda VA in the greater Los Angeles area. The VA maintains a centralized data repository for the entire VA health care system, providing a comprehensive resource to examine burden. Each VA medical center sends computerized excerpts of every health care encounter to the Austin Automation Center, where centralized SAS file extracts are created. For these analyses, we focused on the VA Outpatient Clinic or OPC files, which are patient-level databases organized by fiscal year and include demographics, type of visit, clinic stops and, since 1997, outpatient diagnoses. We examined four urologic conditions: benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms (BPH/LUTS), kidney stones (KS), urinary tract infections (UTI), and urinary incontinence (UI). Physician experts derived inclusion and exclusion ICD-9 diagnosis code-based criteria for each urologic condition. These algorithms in turn were reviewed and refined by nationally recognized experts in urology. We identified patients with qualifying diagnosis codes associated with outpatient visits from October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2001 (FY 2001) in the national VA Outpatient Clinic (OPC) file thereby generating case counts for each diagnostic category. The population studied included all U.S. veterans age 18 and older with at least 1 outpatient visit in any VA health care facility nationwide in FY 2001 (n=3,691,519). We eliminated redundant patients seen at more than one facility to arrive at unique patient counts for our denominators. We first identified the base population at risk in the same year (male veterans 40+ for BPH; male and female patients 18+ for other conditions). We used similar approaches to stratify diseases burden by risk categories, including age, gender, and race-ethnicity. We also examined the differences in case counts based on use of primary diagnosis (the main reason for the specific encounter) vs. any listed diagnoses (secondary diagnoses that are not the chief reason for a patient’s visit). We measured prevalence as the number of existing cases per 100,000 unique outpatients.  RESULTS Among veteran users of VA health care services, the prevalence among patients ages 40 and older with a primary diagnosis of BPH/LUTS was 4,811 per 100,000 unique patients in FY2001 (4.8%, Table 1 ). The number of patients diagnosed with kidney stones was much lower at 605 cases per 100,000; 570 and 381 cases per 100,000 patients for men and women (0.6% and 0.4%, respectively). UTIs were more than twice as common among women veterans compared to men (4,265 female and 1,719 male UTIs per 100,000, Figure 1 ). This was due to the high frequency of visits for cystitis among women. The prevalence of outpatient visits for pyelonephritis was only slightly higher in women. Urinary incontinence was over four times more prevalent among women than men (2,161 female and 515 male UIs per 100,000, Figure 1 ). We measured the absolute number of cases as another means to assess disease burden. BPH/LUTS had the highest absolute burden with nearly 160,000 cases identified in 2001 alone ( Table 1 ). While visits for UTIs were more frequent among women veterans, there were over 60,000 men with an outpatient visit for a UTI in the same year and only 7000 such women. Similar patterns existed for urinary incontinence, where the high prevalence rate was not associated with a number of cases because women represented only 5–7% of the user population during that time period. We also examined the impact of defining prevalence using visits for which the condition of interest was a primary diagnosis (the primary reason for the encounter) versus defining prevalence using visits for which the condition was a secondary diagnosis (found in any diagnosis position in the outpatient records). Prevalence based on “any” diagnosis resulted in significantly higher rates for each condition. The highest increases were for female urinary incontinence, for which use of “any diagnosis” nearly doubled the estimated prevalence (from 2.2% to 3.8%), and BPH/LUTS, which increased by 136% (from 4.8% to 11.4%, Table 1 ). Using “any” diagnosis had the least impact on female kidney stones and UTIs. The age distribution for each of these urologic conditions varied by disease. BPH/LUTS increased linearly with age, from 808 to 7,136 per 100,000 for 40–44 vs. 85+ age groups, with a small decline for patients 85 and older. The age distribution for patients with kidney stones was roughly normally distributed, with peak prevalence among 45–64 year olds (838/100,000). There was no significant variation in the prevalence of urinary tract infections by age. Urinary incontinence in men increased with age, from 87 per 100,000 for men ages 25 years and younger to 1,365 per 100,000 for men 85 years an over. However, UI rates rose at a much earlier age for women veterans than for male veterans. Our examination of racial-ethnic differences revealed that Hispanic veterans had the highest prevalence of BPH/LUTS and kidney stones, followed by Caucasians ( Table 2 ). Among women veterans, Hispanic women had the highest UTI rates, whereas Hispanic and black male veterans had the highest UTI rates among men. White female veterans had the highest rates of urinary incontinence, while black women had the lowest, a pattern that is reversed for male veterans.

Each of the four urologic diseases studied poses a large burden on the health of both female and male veterans and on the health care system caring for them. However, we found the utilization rates for each of the four diseases among veterans to be similar to data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), a national sample of data collected from non-federally employed physicians engaged in direct patient care 7 . This contradicts our hypothesis that veterans, who have full access to healthcare resources through the VA, might have been be more likely to use more resources and therefore have higher rates of utilization (a phenomenon known as “moral hazard” 8 ). Many veterans receiving care in the VA system seek additional care outside of the VA system, and therefore may be newly diagnosed with a condition, such as an acute episode of renal colic from a kidney stone, elsewhere. This might explain why the use of “any” (secondary) diagnoses resulted in a lower prevalence for each disease compared to other utilization studies. BPH/LUTS was identified in 11.4% of veterans over 40, including men with both a primary and secondary diagnosis, with a linear increase in prevalence with age. This utilization rate was lower than that in NAMCS (14.5%) 9 . Data from the Massachusetts Male Aging Study (MMAS) showed the prevalence of BPH, as identified by clinical diagnosis or history of surgery for BPH, to range from 8.4% in men 40 to 49 years of age to 33.5% in men aged 60 to 70 9 , 10 . This linear increase in age was similar to that seen in our study. We also found a higher prevalence of BPH/LUTS among Hispanic veterans, followed by Caucasians and African Americans. In a comparison of data from the Olmsted County Study of Urinary Symptoms and Health Status and the Flint Men's Health Study, Sarma et al. found that 34% of white men reported moderate/severe LUTS compared with 41% of black men 11 - a finding that contrasts with our findings for black and white men. The black men in the Flint study may have lacked access to care such as that provided by the VA, explaining the worse symptoms among those men. Primary diagnoses of UTIs were more than twice as common among women veterans compared to men (4,265 female and 1,719 male UTIs per 100,000), yet prevalence was high in both men and women. NAMCS data from 2000 similarly reported a rate of 6,013 per 100,000 (6.0%) office visits by women with a primary diagnosis of UTI and a rate of 1,342 per 100,000 (1.3%) visits by men 12 , 13 . The rates of outpatient care-seeking for stone disease as a primary diagnosis among veterans (597 per 100,000, or 0.6%) also compared closely to rates from NAMCS, 668 per 100,000 population, or 0.7%, in the year 2000 9 . The utilization rates for a primary diagnosis of urinary incontinence were similar between the VA system (2.2% for women and 0.5% for men) and NAMCS (1.1% for women and 1.1% for men). However, rates in both datasets were lower than expected, given the very high prevalence of the condition in the community 14 – 17 . The differences in clinical utilization rates and community-based questionnaire data are likely due to the fact that the majority of people with incontinence do not seek treatment for it 17 . Interestingly, the racial distribution of urinary incontinence in the VA system paralleled that found by the 1999–2001 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 14 – 17 ; Caucasian women and African American men had the highest prevalence. This may be due to more stress incontinence among Caucasian women and more urge incontinence among African Americans 14 . This study faces a number of important limitations. First, the diagnosis codes in the VA databases may have variable accuracy. VHA providers are not reimbursed for specific diagnoses or treatment, and therefore may have less incentive to accurately code all conditions 18 . Second, race-ethnicity data in the VA administrative datasets are based historically on observation, which may result in misclassification. Race-ethnicity is also missing in many records, and missing data rates are sometimes as high as 30%, biased towards complete data for patients with a history of hospitalization. Furthermore, regional differences in race/ethnicity may explain some of the variability we identified. For example, if there are more Hispanics in the southern U.S., the higher prevalence of stone disease in Hispanics may be attributed to location and weather rather than ethnicity. Also, the comparisons we made with data from NAMCS should be interpreted with a degree of caution, as the data were obtained in a different manner, and physicians who participated in NAMCS may have been more thorough in coding the primary and secondary diagnoses, resulting in higher prevalence rates. Nonetheless, the urologic disease burden here provides a portrait of the annual impact on the VA system.  COMMENT Our study had several important findings.

CONCLUSIONS This study represents a national assessment of the disease burden of common urologic conditions among veteran users of the VA health care system. The urologic disease burden among veteran users of VA health care services is high and poses a significant burden not only among veterans but to the VA health care system responsible for caring for them. We found that use of primary diagnosis in these administrative datasets significantly underestimated urologic disease burden. The aging of veteran users will only further increase the urologic disease burden. At this early juncture, more research is needed on patterns of care and quality in terms of disease detection, diagnosis, treatment and health outcomes in VA settings.
