Serine 28 Phosphorylation of NRIF3 Confers its Coactivator Function for Estrogen Receptor-? Transactivation NRIF3 is an estrogen-inducible nuclear receptor coregulator that stimulates estrogen receptor-alpha (ER?) transactivation functions and associates with the endogenous ER and its target gene promoter. P21-activated protein kinase 1 (Pak1) phosphorylates ER? at Ser305 and this modification plays an important role in ER? transactivation function. Although ER? transactivation functions are regulated by coactivator activity of NRIF3( Talukder et al ., 2004 ), it remains unclear whether Pak1 could impact ER functions via a posttranslational modification of NRIF3. Here, we report that Pak1 phosphorylates NRIF3 at Serine28 and that NRIF3 binds to Pak1 in vitro and in vivo . We found that NRIF3 phosphorylation, coactivator activity, and association with ER? increased following Pak1 phosphorylation of NRIF3’s Ser28 and that activated ER?-Ser305 and NRIF3-Ser28 cooperatively support transactivation of ER?. NRIF3 expression increased significantly in cells with inducible Pak1 expression. We found that NRIF3 and ER? interaction, sub-cellular localization, and ER? transactivation activity all increased in cells expressing the Pak1 phosphorylation mimicking mutant NRIF3-Ser28Glu. Consistently, the NRIF3-Ser28Glu mutant exhibited an enhanced recruitment to the endogenous ER target genes and increased expression following estrogen stimulation. Finally, breast cancer cells with stable over-expression of NRIF3 showed increased proliferation and enhanced anchorage-independent growth. These findings suggest that NRIF3-Ser28 is a physiologic target of Pak1 signaling and contributes to the enhanced NRIF3 coactivator activity, leading to coordinated potentiation of ER? transactivation, its target gene expression, and estrogen responsiveness of breast cancer cells.  Materials and Methods Cell culture and antibodies Human breast cancer cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For estrogen treatment, regular medium was replaced by medium containing 3% DCC (charcoal-stripped serum). Antibody against NRIF3 (Cat# 10743-1-AP) was purchased from Proteintech Group Inc., Chicago, IL; anti-T7-tag (Cat# 69522) from EMD Chemicals, Inc., San Diego, CA; anti-HA-tag (Cat# sc-7392), anti-ER? (Cat# sc-7207), and anti-cyclin D1 from the Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; anti-actin (Cat# a-4700) and anti-vinculin (Cat# v-9131) from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; anti-Pak1 (Cat# 2602) from Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA. Anti-mouse- and anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase-conjugates were purchased from Amersham, Piscataway, NJ. Pak1 kinase assay In vitro kinase assays using GST-NRIF3 fusion protein were performed in HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 1 mM DTT) containing 1 ?g of purified bacterially expressed GST-Pak1 enzyme, 10 ?Ci of [?-32P]ATP, and 25 ?M unlabeled ATP. The reaction was carried out in a 30 ?l volume for 30 min at 30°C and then stopped by addition of 10 ?l of 4X SDS buffer. Reaction products were then analyzed on a SDS-PAGE, transferred to a blot, and developed by autoradiography. Plasmid Construction and Point Mutations at Serine28 of NRIF3 A PCR based approach was used for site-directed mutagenesis of the putative Pak1 phosphorylation site at ser28 of full-length GST-NRIF3. We used the following primers: for Ser28Ala, the forward primer was 5?AGGAAGAAAGCTGTTATAACTTAT 3? and the reverse primer was 5?ATAAGTTATAACAGCTTTCTTCCT 3?; for Ser28Glu, the forward primer was 5?AGGAAGAAAGAGGTTATAACTTAT 3? and the reverse primer was 5?ATAAGTTATAACCTCTTTCTTCCT 3? using Stratagene’s Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit. To make T7-tagged S28A and S28E-mutated full-length NRIF3 for mammalian expression, we digested the GST-constructs with Bam HI and Not I and ligated them into pcDNA3.1A (Invitrogen) at the same sites. In vitro transcription, translation, and GST pull-down assays In vitro transcription and translation of the test proteins were performed using the TNT-transcription-translation system (Promega). One microgram of T7-tagged plasmid DNA was translated in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine in a 50-?l reaction volume by using the T7-TNT reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was diluted to 1 ml with the NP40 lysis buffer, and an aliquot (250 ?l) was used for each GST pull-down assay. The identity of of the translated reaction mixture was verified by subjecting 2 ?l to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The GST pull-down assays were performed by incubating equal amounts of GST or GST-fusion protein immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham) with in vitro translated 35S-labeled test protein. The mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 4°C and washed six times with NP40 lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 2xSDS buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. The transferred protein on the blot was visualized using Ponceau S stain. Interference of NRIF3 and Pak1 expression by siRNA We used small interfering RNA (siRNA) designed by Qiagen to target human NRIF3 ( Talukder et al., 2004 ). Human Pak1 siRNA was bought from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). As a control, we used a commercially available nonspecific random siRNA. MCF-7 cells were seeded at 30% density the day before transfection in 6-well plates. On the day of transfection, cells were changed to antibiotic-free 10% serum or 3% DCC medium (for estrogen treatment). siRNA transfections were performed by using Oligofectamin reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with 12 ?l of 20 ?M siRNA and 4 ?l of oligofectamin reagent/well in 6-well plates (50 nM final concentration). For estrogen treatment, cells were transfected with siRNA in 3% DCC serum. For luciferase assay, cells were re-transfected after 24 h of siRNA transfection with ERE-luciferase plus other plasmids and incubated in 3% DCC medium for another 48 h; estrogen (10?9M) was added during the last 8 h before harvest. Transient transfection, immunoprecipitation, in vivo phosphorylation, and Western blot MCF-7 cells at 70% confluence in 60-mm plates were transiently transfected with 4 ?g of T7-tagged wtNRIF3 or S28A-NRIF3 using Fugene method (Roche). Some plates were also transfected with Pak1 siRNA (50 nM final concentration) 24 h before plasmid transfection. For in vivo phosphorylation, cells were washed with phosphate-free medium containing 1X Na-pyruvate, 1X L-glutamine, and 2% dialyzed FCS and incubated for 1 h in the same medium. Then 32P-labeled orthophosphate (20 ?l/ml; specific activity, 20 ?Ci/ml) was added and incubated overnight at 37°C. Cells were washed with 1XPBS and lysed in TritonX-100 lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol containing 1 mM NaVO5, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) for 15 min on ice and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-T7-agarose beads or NRIF3-antibody for 4 h at 4°C, washed three times with washing buffer, boiled for 5 min in 2X SDS-loading buffer and run into 12 % SDS-PAGE, and finally transferred to nitrocellulose blot overnight at 4°C. For in vivo phosphorylation, the blot was developed by autoradiogram, and for Western blot the same membrane was blocked with 5% fat-free milk and developed against monoclonal T7-antibody or anti-Pak1 antibody using ECL method. Stable cell lines MCF-7 cells were transfected with three different plasmids of T7-NRIF3 constructs (wtNRIF3, S28A-NRIF3, and S28E-NRIF3). After 48 h, G418 (500 ?g/ml final concentration) was added and selection pressure maintained for 3 weeks. Clones from each plate were pooled and maintained as individual clones. Total RNA was isolated from cell lines stably transfected with pcDNA and NRIF3 using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD). Expression of T7-NRIF3 was verified by RT-PCR using T7-tagged forward primer is pcDNA982For 5? CAGCAAATGGGTCGGGATC 3? and the reverse primer was NRIF3-373Rev 5? GCTCTCTACTGCCCTCCAAA 3? and Western blot using anti-T7 mAb and NRIF3 antibody (PTG Inc. Chicago, IL) Immunofluorescent labeling and confocal microscopy Indirect immunofluorescence was used to establish the cellular localization of the T7 tag of transfected wild-type NRIF3 and endogenous ER?. Briefly, MCF-7 cells were plated on sterile glass cover slips in 6-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then co-transfected with wild type T7-NRIF3. After 24 h, cells were rinsed twice in PBS, fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and permeabilized in acetone at ?20°C for 4 min. Cells were then blocked in 5% normal goat serum-PBS for 30 min, incubated with primary antibodies raised against T7 (Bethyl, Montgomery, TX, USA) or ER? (sc-7207, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:1000 and 1:100, respectively, in 1% NGS-PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Following incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and then incubated with goat-anti-mouse or goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with 546-Alexa (red) or 488-Alexa (green) from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR, USA). The DNA dye TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes) was used for nuclear localization (blue). Microscopic analyses were performed using an Olympus FV300 laser scanning confocal microscope in accordance with established methods, utilizing sequential laser excitation to minimize the possibility of fluorescence emission bleed through. Each image consisted of a single Z section captured at the same cellular level and magnification. For the effect of estrogen on localization of NRIF3, MCF-7 cells were transfected with either wild-type or mutant T7-NRIF3. After 24 h, cells were incubated in DCC media without serum for 48 hand then treated with 10% fetal calf serum with and without pretreatment with the pure antiestrogen ICI (10?8M for 60 min), or with 17?-estradiol (10?7M for 30 min). Following treatment, cells were fixed and stained with primary antibodies raised against T7 (Novegen, Madison, WI USA) or ER?. Cells demonstrating nuclear colocalization (yellow) of transfected NRIF3 (green) and endogenous ER? (red) in at least 150 cells per treatment group were counted and graphed as a percentage of the total cells counted. Transient transfection and promoter assays Cells were maintained in DMEM/ F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For reporter-gene transient transfections, cells were cultured in medium without phenol red and containing 3% charcoal-stripped (DCC) serum for 24–36 h. Transient transfection with the appropriate plasmids was performed using Fugene-6 (Roche Biochemical, New Jersey) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and promoter assays were performed 48 hafter transfection. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay T7-NRIF3 stable clones and pcDNA control vector were used for the ChIP assay. The cells were kept in a medium without phenol red and containing 3% charcoal-stripped (DCC) serum 48 h before estrogen or ICI treatment or both; when both were used, ICI was added 1 h before estrogen. ChIP assay was performed as described ( Talukder et al., 2004 )). Approximately 1x106 cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde (final concentration, v/v) for 10 min at 37°C to cross-link histones to DNA and washed twice with PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail. Cells were lysed by sonication and immunoprecipitated with T7 monoclonal antibody (Novagen). The immunoprecipitates were washed, and the DNA was eluted off the beads; purified DNA (phenol-chloroform extraction) was subjected to PCR. The sequence of the forward and reverse primers for pS2 promoter used in this study was 5?GAATTAGCTTAGGCCTAGACGGAATG-3? and 5?AGGATTTGCTGATAGACAGAGACGAC-3? respectively. 17-?-Estradiol, ICI-182780, and stock chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The sequences of the forward and reverse primers for NRIF3 promoter were 5?ACTACCTTTCTCAGCCTCTGGTAACC-3? (spanning region -5193 to -5218 bp) and 5?GGGAACCCTCTTACACTGTTGGTAG-3? (spanning region -4730 to -755 bp), respectively. MTT cell viability assay The cell viability assay is based on the ability of viable mitochondria to convert 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), a soluble tetrazolium salt, into an insoluble formazan precipitate, which can be quantitated by spectrophotometry. NRIF3 and pcDNA clones were seeded in a 96-well plate (2000 cells/plate). After 24 h, white medium containing 3%DCC was exchanged for regular medium. At 72 h, cells were treated with or without estrogen for 15 h. Then cells were rinsed with 1XPBS and 0.1 ml MTT solution (5mg/ml in PBS) was added. Cells were incubated at 37°C for cleavage of MTT for 4 h (at the end of this time, the MTT formazan produced in wells containing live cells appears as black, fuzzy crystals on the bottom of the well), and 0.1 ml isopropanol/HCl (0.4 N) was added to each well and mixed thoroughly by repeated pipetting with a multichannel pipettor. (Isopropanol dissolves the formazan to give a homogeneous blue solution suitable for absorbance measurement.) The absorbance was measured within an hour on an ELISA plate reader at 570 nm. Cell growth and soft agar assays Colony growth assays were performed as described previously (14). Briefly. a 1 ml of solution of 0.6% DIFCO agar in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS with insulin was layered onto 35x15 mm graded tissue culture plates. Stable clones of pcDNA and NRIF3 (10,000 cells/plate) were mixed with 1 ml of 0.36% Bactoagar solution in DMEM prepared in a similar manner and layered on top of the 0.6% Bactoagar layer. Plates were incubated for 28 days. For treatment with estrogen, cells were replaced with DCC serum and then added 10?9M estrogen.  Cell culture and antibodies Human breast cancer cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For estrogen treatment, regular medium was replaced by medium containing 3% DCC (charcoal-stripped serum).

Forward primer is vector specific and reverse primer is NRIF3 specific.  Conclusions In our study described here, we identified Serine 28 (RKKS) of NRIF3 as a Pak1 phosphorylation site. In addition, we found that NRIF3 but not its Ser28-phosphorylation mutant confers coactivator function upon ER-target genes. Phosphorylation of co-activators modifies 3D-conformation of coregulators in favor of a stabilized coactivator, leading to increased coactivator activity. Consistent with this notion, NRIF3-Ser28 phosphylation potentiated ER? transactivation function, presumably due to an enhanced NRIF3-ER? interaction and its resulting recruitment to the ER-target gene chromatin. Since Pak1 signaling is known to phosphorylate ER? on Ser305 and we have now established that Pak1 also phosphorylates NRIF3-Ser28, we also established a positive co-operative role of NRIF3-Ser28 and ER?-Ser305 in stimulating ER-transactivation function and expression of the target genes pS2 and Cyclin D1. Our results implicated activated NRIF3 (i.e. NRIF3-S28E) in the ER-induced stimulation of proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in breast cancer cells, thus demonstrating the functional significance of these molecular interactions. Collectively, the results presented here provide novel insights into NRIF3 function, leading to recognization of its phosphorylation-dependent coactivator activity upon ER? transcriptional action, and consequently, growth stimulation of breast cancer cells.
