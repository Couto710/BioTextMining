Review and pooled analysis of studies on MTHFR C677T polymorphism and esophageal cancer Esophageal cancer has been associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption, gastric reflux, exposure to nitrosamines from food or other environmental sources, and diets lacking folate. Susceptibility to esophageal cancer may be modified by functional polymorphisms in genes along the folate metabolic pathway, such as methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ). The C677T polymorphism is the most common functional variant, leading to a reduction in enzyme activity. We report a pooled analysis of 5 studies on the association of MTHFR C677T polymorphism and esophageal cancer, including 725 cases and 1531 controls. A significant association between the MTHFR 677 TT genotype and esophageal cancer was observed (OR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.75–3.94), although there was significant heterogeneity between studies. A sensitivity analysis excluded one study; the association between TT genotype and esophageal cancer was still present, although of reduced magnitude (OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 0.96–2.56). A significant interaction between smoking and TT genotype on esophageal cancer risk was observed, while no interaction was observed between alcohol consumption and genotype.  RESULTS The results of the pooled analysis are summarized in table 3 . There was a significant overall association between MTHFR 677 TT genotype (OR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.75 – 3.94), but not MTHFR 677 CT genotype (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.84–1.77) and esophageal cancer, with a significant trend across genotypes ( CC < CT < TT ; p < 0.01). However, significant heterogeneity was observed ( CT : p < 0.01; TT : p < 0.01). No evidence of publication bias was found for the CT genotype (p = 0.57) nor for the TT genotype (p = 0.15). The sensitivity analysis indicated that removal of one study 34 from the analysis reduced the evidence of heterogeneity ( CT : p = 0.47; TT : p = 0.60). The direction of the overall association of TT genotype with esophageal cancer was similar, although the magnitude of the association decreased (OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 0.96–2.56). No association was observed for CT genotype and esophageal cancer (OR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.57–1.36). After performing sensitivity analysis there was still no evidence of publication bias for TT genotype (p = 0.96), but there was evidence of publication bias for CT genotype (p = 0.05). The analysis was then restricted to squamous cell carcinoma (n = 579); similar results were observed for the TT genotype (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.49–2.69), and the CT genotype (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.05–1.76). There were insufficient cases to analyze the association of MTHFR C677T and esophageal adenocarcinoma. A significant positive association between the MTHFR 677 TT genotype and esophageal cancer was observed in never smokers (OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.68–3.93), but not for the CT genotype (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 0.83–1.81), with a positive trend across genotypes ( CC < CT < TT ; p < 0.01). Among ever-smokers, there was no association between the genotype and esophageal cancer ( TT : OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.89–1.78; CT : OR = 1.25, 95% CI: 0.94–1.65; trend: p = 0.16). A significant interaction was identified between smoking and the MTHFR 677 genotype in both the full pooled analysis and in the analysis restricted to the homogeneous studies. We further evaluated the effect of cumulative smoking dose, measured in average packs of cigarettes smoked per year (pack-years), on esophageal cancer risk according to the MTHFR 677 genotype ( table 4 ). There was no effect of the genotype on the risk of the esophageal cancer associated with smoking dose. No significant interaction was found between alcohol consumption and the MTHFR 677 genotype. No significant three-way interaction between alcohol, smoking, and MTHFR 677 genotype was observed.  RESULTS The results of the pooled analysis are summarized in table 3 . There was a significant overall association between MTHFR 677 TT genotype (OR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.75 – 3.94), but not MTHFR 677 CT genotype (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.84–1.77) and esophageal cancer, with a significant trend across genotypes ( CC < CT < TT ; p < 0.01).

No significant three-way interaction between alcohol, smoking, and MTHFR 677 genotype was observed.  DISCUSSION This pooled analysis, containing 725 cases and 1,531 controls from 5 studies, suggests an overall association between MTHFR 677 TT genotype and esophageal cancer, although with some heterogeneity between studies, and a non significant association between CT genotype and esophageal cancer. A recent meta-analysis by Larsson (2006) 3 also examined the association between MTHFR C677T and esophageal cancer, but did not report a summary estimate due to significant heterogeneity between published studies. Meta-analyses and/or pooled-analyses examining the role of MTHFR C677T and other cancers have reported significant positive associations with gastric cancer, multiple myeloma, and breast cancer (postmenopausal women) 15 , 59 – 61 ; while significant inverse associations have been reported for leukemia (adults) and colorectal cancer 60 . However, a recent meta-analysis reported no significant association for MTHFR C677T and lung cancer 62 . Additionally, we report a significant negative interaction between smoking and MTHFR 677 genotype. The direction of the interaction is contrary to the expected effect, given that tobacco smoke has been reported to impair folate status through biological activation of folate and B12. Since low folate status has been shown to interact with MTHFR C677T 22 , it would be expected that TT genotype would be associated with increased risk compared with CC genotype in smokers. We did not observe an interaction between MTHFR 677 genotype and alcohol. In a previous study, Yang et al 33 observed no interaction between smoking and MTHFR C677T polymorphism on esophageal cancer risk, but reported an interaction between alcohol consumption and genotype, observing an inverse trend across genotypes ( CC > CT > TT ) in heavy drinkers. As with tobacco smoke, alcohol has been shown to act as a folate antagonist ( figure 1 ). It is possible that individual folate levels may play a role in the interaction between alcohol, smoking of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism; unfortunately we did not have sufficient individual folate data for use as a covariate in the pooled analysis. The validity of the present pooled analysis may be limited because the available data only includes Asian and a small proportion of Caucasian subjects. However, this is representative of the published literature, which contains 8 studies; 6 of which report on Asian populations 29 , 33 – 36 , 38 , 1 on Caucasians 37 , and 1 on both Asian and Caucasian subjects 39 . Currently, there is no literature evaluating the association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and esophageal cancer in races other than Asian and Caucasian, such as Latinos, Native Americans, Aboriginals, or people of African decent. A strength of our analysis, and pooled analyses in general, is that the aggregation of data from multiple studies may afford better statistical power necessary to detect an association if one exists. The pooled analysis has advantages over meta-analysis 63 , allowing for adjustment for potential confounders, testing of interactions, and stratification. Thus, we were able to adjust for age, gender, race and smoking status; test for interactions between alcohol consumption, smoking, and MTHFR C677T ; and stratify our results by smoking habit, which would not be possible with meta-analysis given the aggregate nature of the data available in the published studies. In conclusion, we report an association of MTHFR 677 TT genotype and esophageal cancer, and an interaction between smoking and genotype. However, the folate metabolic pathway is very complex, and is mediated by a variety of gene products, folate, and nutrient cofactors. Future research on MTHFR C677T and esophageal cancer should be further targeted at the interactive effects of dietary and environmental factors, and gene-gene interactions. Large-scale studies are required to whether an interaction exists between MTHFR C677T and folate levels on esophageal cancer, and if this modifies the risk of esophageal cancer associated with both smoking and alcohol.
