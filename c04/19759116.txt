Melanin Targeted Pre-clinical PET Imaging of Melanoma Metastasis Dialkylamino-alkyl-benzamide possess affinities for melanin, suggesting that such 18F-labeled benzamides could potentially be used as melanin targeted positron emission tomography (PET) probes to identify melanotic melanoma metastases in vivo with high sensitivity and specificity. In this report, we describe the synthesis, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of 18F-N-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]-4-fluoro-Benzamide (18F-FBZA) in mouse tumor models. The sigma receptor binding affinity of 19F-FBZA was determined along with the in vitro cellular uptakes of the radiofluorinated 18F-FBZA in B16F10 cells. In vivo distribution and µPET imaging studies using B16F10 melanoma, A375M amelanotic melanoma and U87MG tumor bearing mice were conducted, as well as comparative studies with 2-deoxy-2-18F-fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) PET imaging of the melanoma models is described. In vitro , the uptake of 18F-FBZA was significantly higher in B16F10 cells treated with L-tyrosine ( P < 0.001). In vivo , 18F-FBZA displayed significant tumor uptake; 5.95 ± 1.82 %ID/g in B16F10 tumors and only 0.75 ± 0.06 %ID/g and 0.56 ± 0.13 %ID/g was observed at 2 h in the amelanotic A375M and U87MG tumors respectively. Murine-lungs bearing melanotic B16F10 pulmonary metastases displayed a significantly higher lung uptake compared to the normal lungs ( P < 0.01). µPET imaging clearly identifies melanotic lesions in both primary and pulmonary metastases B16F10 tumor models. Co-registered µCT with µPET along with biopsies further confirmed the presence of tumor lesions in the mouse lungs. 18F-FBZA specifically targets primary and metastatic melanotic-melanoma lesions with high tumor uptake and may have translational potentials.  [Introduction] Malignant melanoma is one of the most lethal cancers because of its high systemic metastatic potential. Although it represents 5% of all skin cancers, malignant melanoma contributes to more than 50% of skin cancer related death. Moreover, the incidence rate of this disease has doubled over the past two decades and is continually increasing, making it a significant public health problem in Europe and the United States ( 1 , 2 ). Currently, while regimens for effective treatment of melanoma are still not available, increased surveillance with early diagnosis and accurate staging of the diseases provides an important approach for increasing the survival rate. Positron emission tomography (PET) offers the promise of non-invasively imaging micrometastases ( 3 , 4 ), however this must be coupled with an appropriate PET imaging-probe to provide oncologists with a highly sensitive procedure for metastases detection and accurate staging of high-risk melanomas. By imaging different tumor molecular targets and pathways, several PET probes, including 2-deoxy-2-18F-fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) ( 3 – 5 ), 6-18F-fluoro-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA) ( 6 ), L-[methyl-11C]methionine (11C-methionine) ( 7 ), 3'-18F-fluoro-3'-deoxy-L-thymidine (18F-FLT) ( 8 ), 18F-galacto-RGD peptide ( 9 ), etc., have been evaluated for melanoma detection in patients. However, reports suggest that the overall detection rate was “extremely low” for the occult metastatic lesion in patients with stage IB-II melanoma using 18F-FDG-PET/CT ( 5 ). 18F-FDG also failed to identify metastatic lesions <1 cm in diameter located mainly in common melanoma metastatic sites; the lungs, liver or brain ( 3 ). Moreover, the molecular targets for 18F-FDG are glucose transporters (e.g., GLUT1) and hexokinase, which relate to the glycolytic activity of tumors ( 10 ). Novel PET probes with higher specificity and sensitivity of other molecular targets and biological processes in melanoma are still highly desired, in order to detect small melanoma lesions and metastases or to visualize and monitor the expression and activity of other molecular targets. Melanin is an amorphous, irregular polymer which is composed of mixtures of two separate but biogenetically related pigments, eumelanins and phenomelanins ( 11 , 12 ). Melanin biosynthesis is an essential metabolic pathway regulated by tyrosinase activity in melanocytes ( 13 ). In malignant melanoma, melanin formation is highly increased because tyrosinase activity is significantly elevated ( 12 , 14 ). Taking advantage of unique physiological process of melanin synthesis, many studies have been done to develop melanin-targeted radiotherapeutical and chemotherapeutical ( 15 – 17 ) agents for melanoma treatment. Benzamide analogs possess selective affinities with melanin. Over the past two decades, they have been extensively investigated for development of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging agents for melanoma detection. Many of them exhibit excellent in vivo tumor targeting profiles. It was reported that N-(2-diethylaminoethy1)-4-125I-iodo-benzamide (125I-BZA) displayed 6.75 ± 0.67 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g) tumor uptake at 1 h in C57BL6 mice bearing B16 melanoma. At 24 h, the tumor-to-blood ratio as high as 37.3 ± 6.9 can be attained ( 18 ). Several iodinated benzamide derivatives including 123I-BZA ( 21 ), N-(2-diethylaminoethyl)-2-123I-iodobenzamide (123I-BZA2) ( 20 ), 123/131I-N-(2-diethylaminoethyl)-3-iodo-4-methoxybenzamide (123/131I-IMBA) ( 19 ), 123I-2-hydroxy-3-iodo-6-methoxy-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl] benzamide (123I-IBZM) ( 22 ), have been further studied in patients for melanoma imaging. These SPECT probes have shown promising results for detection melanoma lesions in clinic. Additionally, based on the structural elements of these benzamides, several 99mTc-complexes have also been designed and also display high melanoma tumor uptake and excellent in vivo melanoma imaging characteristics with SPECT in preclinical melanoma models ( 23 , 24 ). Thus the benzamide analogs are a reasonable starting point for further developing melanin targeting 18F-labeled probes for PET imaging of malignant melanoma. Fluorine-18 is an ideal PET imaging probe (t½: 110 min, emits ?+ particles at an energy of 635 keV, 97% abundant). In this study, a 18F-labeled benzamide analog, N-(2-diethylaminoethy1)-4-18F-fluoro-benzamide (18F-FBZA) was synthesized and evaluated for melanin targeted melanoma imaging.  [Material and Methods] General N -succinimidyl-4-fluorobenzoate (SFB) was purchased from ABX GmbH (Radeberg, Germany). All the other chemicals including N,N-Diethylenediamine (DEDA), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), N,N?-Diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), and acetonitrile (CH3CN) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). All instruments including electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), PET dose calibrator, and tumor cell lines are the same as described in our previous publication ( 25 ). Synthesis of <sup>18/19</sup>F-FBZA The non-radioactive reference standard 19F-FBZA was prepared by reaction of DEDA with SFB. Briefly, DEDA (9.8 mg) and SFB (5.3 mg) dissolved in 300 µL of DMSO and 5µL of DIPEA were mixed and reacted for 80 minutes at 50°C. The reaction solution was injected into a semi-preparative HPLC for purification. The flow rate was 3 mL/min, with the mobile phase starting with 95% solvent A and 5% solvent B (0–3 min), going to 35% solvent A and 65% solvent B for 33 min, then changing to 15% solvent A and 85 % solvent B and maintaining this solvent composition for another 3 min (36–39 min), followed by a return to initial solvent composition by 42 min. Fractions containing the product were collected (retention time= 15.5 min) and yielded 70% of the desired compound which was subsequently lyophilized and characterized by ESI-MS or NMR. The measured molecular weight (MW) was consistent with the expected MW: m/z = 239.08 measured for [M+H]+ (C13H20FN2O, calculated MW = 239.15); 1H-NMR (400MHz, DMSO-d6): ? 0.97 (quartet, 8H), 2.5 (s, 15 H), 3.32 (t, 18H), 7.3 (dd, 2H), 7.9 (dd, 2H), 8.5 (t, 1H). The radiofluorination synthon, 18F-SFB was prepared based on the procedure reported previously ( 25 ). 18F-SFB (specific activity of 200–250 GBq/µmol) dissolved in 100 µL of DMSO was added to the DEDA (100 µg) and DIPEA (5µL) and reacted for 30 min at 50°C. The reaction solution was injected into an analytical HPLC using the same elution gradient (flow rate = 1 mL/min) as the one described above for the synthesis of non radioactive 19F-FBZA. The HPLC fractions containing the radiolabeled product 18F-FBZA were collected, combined and evaporated with a rotary evaporator. The 18F-FBZA was reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and passed through a 0.22-µm Millipore filter into a sterile vial for in vitro and in vivo animal experiments. The total radiosynthesis time for 18F-FBZA was 3 hours with an overall decay corrected yield of 50% at the end of synthesis (EOS). Serum Stability The in vitro stability of 18F-FBZA was evaluated by incubation 7.4 MBq (~200 µCi) of probe with mouse serum (1 mL) at 37°C. At different times (30, 60, 120, and 150 min), the solution was filtered using a Nanosep 10 K centrifuge (Pall Corporation, East Hills, NY) to isolate low molecular weight metabolites. The filtrates were analyzed by RP-HPLC under identical conditions used for analyzing original 18F-FBZA. In Vitro Cell Uptake Studies B16F10, A375M, and U87MG cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle High-Glucose medium (Gibco Life Sciences, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with penicillin and streptomycin. The cells were regularly maintained in 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator. The cellular uptake studies were examined in B16F10 cells. Briefly, about 1 × 106 B16F10 cells were plated in a 12-well plate and pretreated with 2 mM L-tyrosine for 24 h. The cells were then incubated with Advanced Modified Eagle’s Medium containing 25mM HEPES, 0.2% BSA, and 0.3 mM 1,10-phenanthroline containing 3.7 kBq (0.1 µCi) of 18F-FBZA for 30, and 120 min under either 37°C or 4°C. Non-treated cells were used for control. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 0.1 N NaOH for 5 minutes under room temperature. The radioactivity of cell lysate was counted by a Wallac 1480 automated– counter (Perkin Elmer, MA). The counts per minute (cpm) and percentage of uptake were plotted as a function of time using Graphpad Prism 5.0 (Northampton, MA). Sigma Receptor Binding Assays Sigma receptor binding assays were conducted using standard methods detailed previously ( 26 ). The in vitro ?1-binding affinity of 19F-FBZA was determined in a competition assay using guinea pig brain membranes and the high-affinity ?1-ligand H-(+)-pentazocine. ?2-receptor binding affinity of 19F-FBZA was determined using rat liver membranes preparations along with 3H-1,3-di- o -tolylguanidine (3H-DTG) as the radioligand in the presence of 10 µM pentazocine was used to mask ?1-receptors. Competition assays were performed with twelve concentrations of the 19F-FBZA ranging from 1 × 10?10 to 1 × 10?3 M and protein samples (0.15 mg of membrane protein) in Tris-HCl (50 mM), pH 8.0, for 120 min at 25 °C in a 0.25 mL volume. Biodistribution All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and California regulation for animal treatment. The subcutaneous tumors models were created with five to six weeks old male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, VA) for B16F10 and Nu/Foxn1 mice (Harlan, IN) for A375M or U87MG. Pulmonary melanoma metastases were established in C57BL/6 mouse lungs via tail vein injection of 0.2 × 106, 0.4 × 106 or 0.8 × 106 B16F10 cells. Biodistribution studies were conducted 1 and/or 2 h after tail vein injection of 18F-FBZA in tumor bearing mice (B16F10, A375M and U87MG; n=3 each). Injected mice were sacrificed at 1 and/or 2 h post injection (p.i.). Tumors, blood and other major organs of interest were harvested, weighted, and counted in a Wallac 1480 automated–counter (Perkin Elmer, MA). The results were expressed as %ID/g. To compare the melanoma imaging abilities of 18F-FBZA with 18F-FDG, B16F10, the mice were fasted over night prior to the experiment. 18F-FDG (3.7 MBq, 100 µCi) was injected via the tail vein of the B16F10 tumor bearing mice and µPET imaged and biodistribution experiments were preformed at 1 h p.i. (n=5). In Vivo Imaging Procedure Small-animal µPET imaging of tumor-bearing mice was performed on a small-animal PET R4 rodent model scanner (Concord Microsystem, Knoxville, TN). A group of mice (n=3) bearing melanotic B16F10 were injected with 18F-FBZA (3.31–3.86 MBq, 89.4–104.3 µCi) via tail vein. For the amelanotic A375M tumors (n=3), 0.87 ?0.95 MBq (23.6–25.8 µCi) of the probe was injected, while for U87MG tumors (n=3), 0.29 – 0.4 MBq (7.95–10.93 µCi) of 18F-FBZA was injected. At 1 and 2 h p.i., the mice were anesthetized with 2% isofluorane (Aerrane’ Baxter, Deerfield, IL), and placed in the prone position and near the center of the filed of view (FOV) of small-animal PET scanner. For 18F-FDG studies, a 3.7 MBq (100 µCi) dose of 18F-FDG was injected via the tail vein. 5-min static scans were obtained and the images were reconstructed by a two-dimensional ordered subsets expectation maximum (OSEM) algorithm. Respiratory gated µ-computed tomography (CT) images were acquired using an in vivo scanner (GE eXplore Locus, GE Healthcare, London, Canada). Immediately after the PET scan, the mice were transported to and positioned in the CT scanner while still fixed to their polystyrene bed containing 4 fiducial markers at different positions. Mice were sedated with 2% isofluorane in 1 L/min oxygen during the scan. The micro-CT images were acquired with the x-ray source set at 70 kVp and 40 µA and synchronized by respirator gating on Biovet system (Newark, NJ). CT images were reconstructed using a fanbeam resorting algorithm with a standard ramp filter. Images were reconstructed on a 512 × 512 pixel grid with a pixel size of 49 × 49 µm. No X-ray contrast medium was used in this study. PET images were imported using ASIPro VMTM (Concorde Microsystems, Knoxville, TN). Region of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually over the tumor or organ of interest on decay-corrected whole-body coronal images. The mean counts per pixel per minute were obtained from the ROIs and converted to counts per milliliter per minute by using a calibration constant. No attenuation correction was performed. CT images imported using GE MicroView (version 2.1.2, GE). In order for co-registration with PET data sets, the fiducial marker points were aligned using alignment wizard in nonproprietary AMIDE software, version 0.9.1 ( 27 ). Statistical Methods Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t -test for unpaired data. A 95% confidence level was chosen to determine the significance between groups, with P < 0.05 being significantly different.  General N -succinimidyl-4-fluorobenzoate (SFB) was purchased from ABX GmbH (Radeberg, Germany).

[Results] Chemistry and Radiochemistry The non-radioactive 19F-FBZA was synthesized in a one-step coupling reaction between DEDA and SFB ( Figure 1 ). HPLC purification of the non-radioactive 19F-FBZA yielded ~70% of the desired product with a 15.5 min retention time. The isolated compound’s identity was subsequently verified and confirmed by ESI-MS and NMR. Similarly, radiosynthesis of 18F-FBZA was achieved through coupling of the radiosynthon, 18F-SFB, with the amino group of DEDA. The procedure and radiochemical synthetic module for production of the radiosynthon 18F-SFB has been well-established in our radiochemistry facility, and 18F-SFB has been successfully used and described in our earlier work for 18F-labeling of a peptide for melanoma imaging ( 25 ). The total time for radiosynthesis of 18F-FBZA was approximately 3 hours. The maximum overall radiochemical yield with decay correction was 50%, and the specific activity of 18F-FBZA was estimated to be 132–166 GBq/µmol at EOS. The radiochemical purity of the product was greater then 95% as verified by analytical HPLC analysis ( Figure 2A ). The authenticity of 18F-FBZA was verified by co-injection with the previously characterized non-radioactive 19F-FBZA. Both cold and radioactive FBZA compounds’ displayed similar HPLC retention time. Serum Stability of <sup>18</sup>F-FBZA 18F-FBZA displayed very good stability in mouse serum ( Figure 2B ). The percentage of intact probe was found to be 94.1%, 93.5%, 87.8% and 85.1% at 30, 60, 120 and 150 min incubation time, respectively. Defluorination was not observed for 18F-FBZA incubated with mouse serum up to 150 min. Overall, 18F-FBZA can be reliably produced and demonstrates good in vitro stability. Cell Uptake of <sup>18</sup>F-FBZA The B16F10 cellular uptake of 18F-FBZA over a 2-hour incubation period at 4 and 37 °C ( Figure 3 ) displayed cellular accumulation of 0.49 ± 0.03% and 0.52 ± 0.1% respectively. Pretreatment of the B16F10 cells with L-tyrosine (2.0 mM) for 24 hours significantly darkened B16F10 cells compared to control cells. These tyrosine-stimulated cells displayed a significantly enhanced cellular accumulation of 18F-FBZA at both 4 and 37°C ( P < 0.001). At 37°C ( Figure 3B ), within 30 minutes of incubation the tyrosine stimulated cells maximized at 10.7 ± 0.8 % uptake of 18F-FBZA and remained at 8.1 ± 1.9 at 2 h, which amounts to a 18–25 fold increase compared to that of the non-treated B16F10 cells. At 4°C ( Figure 3A ), the cell uptake maximized at 30 minutes with 4.5 ± 0.5 % cellular accumulation, and which was 58% less than cellular uptake at 37°C ( P < 0.05). Sigma Receptor-Binding Studies of <sup>19</sup>F-FBZA Benzamide analogs have previously been shown to possess high binding affinity with ? receptors, which are normally over-expressed in melanoma cells ( 26 , 28 ). To gain a better understanding of the involvement of ?-receptors binding of 18F-FBZA in the uptake of FBZA in melanoma cell, we further measured the binding affinity of the non-radioactive 19F-FBZA in established ?-receptor assays using guinea-pig brain (?1-receptor) and rat liver membranes (?2-receptor) preparations ( 24 ). The results of these assays show that 19F-FBZA displays very low affinity towards either ?1 (Ki=8.90 µM) or ?2 (Ki=0.12 mM) receptors. Biodistribution The in vivo biodistributions of 18F-FBZA were examined in B16F10 murine allograft, as well as in the A375M and U87MG xenografts. In biodistribution studies of 18F-FBZA performed at 1 and 2 h in the B16F10 model, 18F-FBZA displayed a significant tumor uptake in the melanotic B16F10 melanoma allograft with 6.47 ± 2.16 and 5.94 ± 1.83 %ID/g at 1 and 2 h respectively ( Table 1 ). Tumor to blood ratio attained were 34.0 ± 13.2 and tumor to muscle ratio was 23.3 ± 10.1 at 2 h. The in vivo biodistribution of 18F-FBZA in the A375M and U87MG mouse models, however were low with tumor uptake values of 0.75 ± 0.09 and 0.56 ± 0.13 %ID/g and tumor to blood ratios of 4.70 ± 0.78 and 3.57 ± 1.34 respectively ( Table 1 ). In the B16F10 pulmonary metastases model, mice were sacrificed 13 days after intravenous inoculation of B16F10 cells. In the two groups of mice (n=3) (0.2 and 0.4 × 106 B16F10 tumor cells) biodistribution and µ-PET studies shows that the radioactivity accumulated in melanoma lung metastases reached 10.0 ± 3.92 and 7.87 ± 3.56 %ID/g at 2 h p.i. for 0.4 and 0.2 × 106 tumor cell inoculation dose, respectively ( Table 2 ). While in normal lung tissue, the probe accumulation was 0.99 ± 0.04 %ID/g at 2 h p.i. ( Table 2 ), which was similar to that observed in the B16F10 subcutaneous model where the normal lung uptake was observed to be 0.85 ± 0.23 %ID/g at 2 h. The lung-to-blood ratios for the pulmonary metastates model were 24.7 ± 13.5 and 38.9 ± 10.3, respectively, for two groups with different inoculated tumor cell doses (0.2 vs . 0.4 × 106). The lung-to-blood ratio observed for B16F10 subcutaneous tumor bearing mice was 4.72 ± 0.46, while 4.23 ± 0.66 was observed in normal control C57BL6 mice at 2 h. Both absolute lung take and lung to blood ratio were significantly higher for pulmonary metastatic model than subcutaneous model and normal C57BL6 mice ( P < 0.01). In order to further explore the translational potential of 18F-FBZA in melanoma imaging, comparative studies were conducted between 18F-FBZA vs . 18F-FDG ( Table 1 ). We found that 18F-FDG uptake by the B16F10 tumor was high (9.46 ± 2.46 %ID/g) at 1 h, and was not significantly different from 18F-FBZA uptake in the same B16F10 tumor model (6.47 ± 2.16 %ID/g). The lung uptake was 7.61 ± 1.53 and 2.92 ± 0.40 %ID/g for 18F-FDG and 18F-FBZA respectively, suggesting much higher normal lung uptake of 18F-FDG ( P <0.01). The heart uptake in 18F-FDG was maximal at 54.36 ± 13.15 %ID/g, and significantly higher than the heart uptake at 1 h for 18F-FBZA (1.62 ± 0.33 %ID; P < 0.01). However, the liver uptake of 18F-FDG was lower (1.81 ± 0.61 %ID/g) than that observed for 18F-FBZA at 1 h p.i. (8.82 ± 2.13 %ID/g; P < 0.05) ( Table 1 ). Imaging Studies In static animal µPET images ( Figure 4A – 1 ), B16F10 tumors were clearly visualized at 1 h with good tumor-to-background contrast. While for A375M and U87MG, the tumor uptake is hardly visible. Liver and kidney uptakes were visualized in all animals. ROI analysis of tumor uptake showed that B16F10 has significantly higher tumor uptake (5.6 ± 1.2 %ID/g) than another two tumors (0.86 ± 0.03 and 0.61 ± 0.04 %ID/g for A375M and U87MG, respectively) ( Figure 4B ) ( P < 0.01). In in vivo studies with the lung metastasis model, compared with the normal lung, an increased symmetrical radioactive region over background in the chest region was clearly visible in the mice bearing pulmonary metastases ( Figure 4A – 2 ). µPET ROI analysis showed the normal lung uptake of 18F-FBZA was 1.2 ± 0.2 %ID/g while an uptake of 10.2 ± 0.1, 9.0 ± 0.4 and 15.3 ± 1.1 %ID/g of 18F-FBZA was observed for lungs harboring metastasis resulting from the tumor dose of 0.2, 0.4 or 0.8 × 106 B16F10 cell respectively ( Figure 4D ). In vivo µPET imaging of the subcutaneous B16F10 melanoma using 18F-FBZA or 18F-FDG shows that the two agents have different biodistribution patterns ( Figure 4A – 3 ). For 18F-FBZA, radioactivity accumulation in tumor and liver are observed as is washed out through the kidneys into the bladder. 18F-FDG on the other hand displays accumulation in the heart, eyes and tumor while the liver activity was low. PET ROI analyses showed the tumor uptake for 18F-FBZA was 5.6 ± 1.2 while 18F-FDG displayed 6.31 ± 0.61 %ID/g tumor uptake ( P > 0.05). PET/CT fusion images clearly demonstrated the tumor anatomy and specific tumor uptake of the different probes.  [Results] Chemistry and Radiochemistry The non-radioactive 19F-FBZA was synthesized in a one-step coupling reaction between DEDA and SFB ( Figure 1 ). HPLC purification of the non-radioactive 19F-FBZA yielded ~70% of the desired product with a 15.5 min retention time. The isolated compound’s identity was subsequently verified and confirmed by ESI-MS and NMR. Similarly, radiosynthesis of 18F-FBZA was achieved through coupling of the radiosynthon, 18F-SFB, with the amino group of DEDA. The procedure and radiochemical synthetic module for production of the radiosynthon 18F-SFB has been well-established in our radiochemistry facility, and 18F-SFB has been successfully used and described in our earlier work for 18F-labeling of a peptide for melanoma imaging ( 25 ). The total time for radiosynthesis of 18F-FBZA was approximately 3 hours. The maximum overall radiochemical yield with decay correction was 50%, and the specific activity of 18F-FBZA was estimated to be 132–166 GBq/µmol at EOS. The radiochemical purity of the product was greater then 95% as verified by analytical HPLC analysis ( Figure 2A ). The authenticity of 18F-FBZA was verified by co-injection with the previously characterized non-radioactive 19F-FBZA. Both cold and radioactive FBZA compounds’ displayed similar HPLC retention time. Serum Stability of <sup>18</sup>F-FBZA 18F-FBZA displayed very good stability in mouse serum ( Figure 2B ). The percentage of intact probe was found to be 94.1%, 93.5%, 87.8% and 85.1% at 30, 60, 120 and 150 min incubation time, respectively. Defluorination was not observed for 18F-FBZA incubated with mouse serum up to 150 min. Overall, 18F-FBZA can be reliably produced and demonstrates good in vitro stability. Cell Uptake of <sup>18</sup>F-FBZA The B16F10 cellular uptake of 18F-FBZA over a 2-hour incubation period at 4 and 37 °C ( Figure 3 ) displayed cellular accumulation of 0.49 ± 0.03% and 0.52 ± 0.1% respectively. Pretreatment of the B16F10 cells with L-tyrosine (2.0 mM) for 24 hours significantly darkened B16F10 cells compared to control cells. These tyrosine-stimulated cells displayed a significantly enhanced cellular accumulation of 18F-FBZA at both 4 and 37°C ( P < 0.001). At 37°C ( Figure 3B ), within 30 minutes of incubation the tyrosine stimulated cells maximized at 10.7 ± 0.8 % uptake of 18F-FBZA and remained at 8.1 ± 1.9 at 2 h, which amounts to a 18–25 fold increase compared to that of the non-treated B16F10 cells. At 4°C ( Figure 3A ), the cell uptake maximized at 30 minutes with 4.5 ± 0.5 % cellular accumulation, and which was 58% less than cellular uptake at 37°C ( P < 0.05). Sigma Receptor-Binding Studies of <sup>19</sup>F-FBZA Benzamide analogs have previously been shown to possess high binding affinity with ? receptors, which are normally over-expressed in melanoma cells ( 26 , 28 ). To gain a better understanding of the involvement of ?-receptors binding of 18F-FBZA in the uptake of FBZA in melanoma cell, we further measured the binding affinity of the non-radioactive 19F-FBZA in established ?-receptor assays using guinea-pig brain (?1-receptor) and rat liver membranes (?2-receptor) preparations ( 24 ). The results of these assays show that 19F-FBZA displays very low affinity towards either ?1 (Ki=8.90 µM) or ?2 (Ki=0.12 mM) receptors. Biodistribution The in vivo biodistributions of 18F-FBZA were examined in B16F10 murine allograft, as well as in the A375M and U87MG xenografts.

However, the liver uptake of 18F-FDG was lower (1.81 ± 0.61 %ID/g) than that observed for 18F-FBZA at 1 h p.i. (8.82 ± 2.13 %ID/g; P < 0.05) ( Table 1 ).  Imaging Studies In static animal µPET images ( Figure 4A – 1 ), B16F10 tumors were clearly visualized at 1 h with good tumor-to-background contrast. While for A375M and U87MG, the tumor uptake is hardly visible. Liver and kidney uptakes were visualized in all animals. ROI analysis of tumor uptake showed that B16F10 has significantly higher tumor uptake (5.6 ± 1.2 %ID/g) than another two tumors (0.86 ± 0.03 and 0.61 ± 0.04 %ID/g for A375M and U87MG, respectively) ( Figure 4B ) ( P < 0.01). In in vivo studies with the lung metastasis model, compared with the normal lung, an increased symmetrical radioactive region over background in the chest region was clearly visible in the mice bearing pulmonary metastases ( Figure 4A – 2 ). µPET ROI analysis showed the normal lung uptake of 18F-FBZA was 1.2 ± 0.2 %ID/g while an uptake of 10.2 ± 0.1, 9.0 ± 0.4 and 15.3 ± 1.1 %ID/g of 18F-FBZA was observed for lungs harboring metastasis resulting from the tumor dose of 0.2, 0.4 or 0.8 × 106 B16F10 cell respectively ( Figure 4D ). In vivo µPET imaging of the subcutaneous B16F10 melanoma using 18F-FBZA or 18F-FDG shows that the two agents have different biodistribution patterns ( Figure 4A – 3 ). For 18F-FBZA, radioactivity accumulation in tumor and liver are observed as is washed out through the kidneys into the bladder. 18F-FDG on the other hand displays accumulation in the heart, eyes and tumor while the liver activity was low. PET ROI analyses showed the tumor uptake for 18F-FBZA was 5.6 ± 1.2 while 18F-FDG displayed 6.31 ± 0.61 %ID/g tumor uptake ( P > 0.05). PET/CT fusion images clearly demonstrated the tumor anatomy and specific tumor uptake of the different probes.

[Discussion] Malignant melanoma is well-known for its aggressiveness and strong metastatic potential and early detection and identification of metastasis can improve the management and prognosis. The lethality of malignant melanoma is mostly caused by the metastasis to distant organs, mainly the lungs, liver, brain and soft tissues. Monoclonal antibody against high molecular-weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMWMA) ( 29 , 30 ) or peptides targeting melanocortin receptor 1 ( 25 , 31 ) have been radiolabeled with various radioisotopes for radioimmunodetection and radioimmunotherapy of malignant melanoma and its metastases. Melanin binding peptides and antibodies are also used to target melanin and have achieved therapeutic effects in melanoma animal models ( 17 , 32 , 33 ). Though antibody and peptide-based approaches successfully target the primary tumor in many melanoma models, the limitations include relatively slow and low tumor uptake, high kidney uptake, instability in vivo etc ( 17 ). Compared with peptide based probes, a group of molecules with coplanar fused rings structure have been shown to strongly bind with melanin ( 34 ). Particularly, benzamide based small molecules can specifically target the melanotic melanoma and their metastases as evidenced by numerous studies of radioiodinated benzamide analogs ( 21 ). In one study the sensitivity and specificity of 123I-BZA has been demonstrated as 100% and 81% respectively in a limited clinical trial ( 35 ). Very recently, an 125I labeled BZA derivative has been developed to show high specific and longer tumor retention time with 16 fold as high as 125I-BZA at 72 h p.i., which makes it a promising radiopharmaceutical for targeted radionuclide therapy of melanoma ( 36 ). With the development of diagnostic PET imaging and its high sensitivity, a 18F based PET imaging probe based on BZA molecules may improve the sensitivity of detection and diagnosis of melanotic melanoma and its metastasis. A 18F-labeled benzamide, 18F-FBZA was thus successfully synthesized and evaluated in cultured cells and tumor bearing mice. In in vitro cellular uptake studies, the treatment of B16F10 cells with L-tyrosine (2 mM) substantially increased the 18F-FBZA uptake from 0.32 ± 0.04 % to 8.1 ± 1.9% at 37°C at 2 h, indicating that the maximal 18F-FBZA uptake is associated with the content of melanin ( Figure 3 ). Although earlier reports in cell culture study and in vivo scintigraphic imaging with 123I-N-(2-Diethylaminoethyl)-4-Iodobenzamide (123I-IDAB) suggested that sigma-receptor 1 and 2 might play an important role in the uptake of benzamides possibly attributable to the neuroectodermal origin of melanoma ( 37 ), however, a low sigma receptor affinity displayed by 19F-FBZA suggests that ?-receptors do not play a role in the B16F10 uptake of this probe. This coupled with the observations that the cellular uptake observed for the 18F-FBZA probe at 4 °C was significantly increased after tyrosine pretreatment cannot be explained by receptor mediated endocytosis. Alternatively, the uptake of benzamides by melanoma has previously been observed with the radioiodinated benzamides, and shown to be related to the melanin content of the cells ( 38 ). Labarre et al. have also shown that a complex interaction between BZA and melanin involves both ionic and hydrophobic binding sites ( 28 , 39 ). In addition to this, recent studies with melanoma targeting 99mTc-complexes designed to mimic and contain the structural elements of BZA have also shown to target melanoma based on the melanin content of the tumors ( 40 ). Taken together these earlier studies and our results suggest that the uptake and accumulation in melanoma cells of the neutral, lipophilic 18F-FBZA entails the cellular uptake of 18F-FBZA by the melanotic B16F10 cells via passive diffusion through cell membrane into cytoplasm followed by binding with melanin structures and trapping within the cells. In in vivo studies, the B16F10 melanotic melanoma was used along with the amelanotic A375M melanoma and the human glioblastoma U87MG as control tumors. The in vivo tumor uptake of 18F-FBZA in B16F10 reaches 6.47 ± 2.16 %ID/g at 1 h and remains high up to 2 h p.i.. In contrast to this, the in vivo tumor uptake of 18F-FBZA by A375M only attains 0.75 ± 0.09 %ID/g and U87MG also displays a low tumor uptake of 0.56 ± 0.13 %ID/g at 2 h, both are significantly lower than the uptakes observed for the melanotic B16F10 tumors ( P < 0.01) ( Table 1 ). Taken together with the in vitro cellular uptake assay, the in vivo results further prove that the target of 18F-FBZA binding is melanin within the melanoma. Analysis of the in vivo results also display no significant difference in the uptake and distribution of 18F-FBZA in other non-target organs among B16F10, A375M and U87MG in vivo tumor models ( Table 1 ) ( P > 0.05). Given the higher tumor uptake in the B16F10 melanotic melanoma, the tumor/normal organ ratios are thus significantly higher for B16F10 model ( P < 0.01), indicating the excellent in vivo tumor targeting ability of 18F-FBZA for melanotic melanoma. Considering the high incidence rate (88%) of melanotic malignant melanoma , 18F-FBZA represents a potentially viable PET imaging probe for clinic studies of metastasis of malignant melanoma. A goal of these studies was to explore the feasibility of 18F-FBZA in the early detection of melanoma metastases. This was accomplished using the preclinical pulmonary metastasis melanoma model in which we found melanotic pulmonary lesion of B16F10 tumors specifically accumulated 18F-FBZA which was evident in both biodistribution and small-animal µPET studies ( Table 2 , Figure 4 ). The lung uptakes in this B16F10 models are significantly higher than lung uptake of 18F-FBZA in B16F10 subcutaneous model lacking pulmonary metastases as well as in normal C57BL/6 mice ( P < 0.05). The lung-to-blood ratio in tumor bearing lungs is 24.67 ± 13.53 for pulmonary metastasis model injected with 2 × 105 cells while normal lung to blood ratio is only 4.23 ± 0.66 ( Table 2 ). More importantly, when compared with 18F-FDG, where the normal lung uptake was 7.61 ± 1.53 %ID/g for FDG, and with more than 50 %ID/g activity accumulated in heart, both of which contributed to high uptake in the chest region, which may overshadow the delineation of melanotic lung lesions and may thus limit the use of 18F-FDG in detection of pulmonary metastasis in melanoma ( Table 1 , Figure 4A – 3 ). It should be pointed out that in µPET images, there was significantly higher lung uptake, shown by symmetrical hot region in the mouse chest bearing B16F10 pulmonary metastases, the individual metastatic lesions are small and exceed the resolution of the µPET scanner plus the motion of the lung of the mice, and single micrometastasis are not discernable using small-animal µPET imaging ( Figure 4A – 2 ). Interestingly, the brain uptake in B16F10 model reach about 1.71 ± 0.06 and 0.35 ± 0.05 %ID/g %ID/g at 1 and 2 h p.i. respectively ( Table 1 ), suggesting that the probe could pass through the blood brain barrier (BBB). The tumor to brain ratio at 1 h for 18F-FBZA reach 5.14 ± 1.10, compared with 2.86 ± 0.35 for 18F-FDG which is due to the high normal brain uptake of 18F-FDG. These results also demonstrated the potential feasibility of using 18F-FBZA for imaging melanoma brain metastases. To further compare 18F-FBZA with 18F-FDG, we found the subcutaneous tumor uptakes at both 1 and 2 h for 18F-FBZA were comparable with 18F-FDG tumor uptake at 1 h ( P > 0.05). However, given the presence of phosphatases in the liver, the liver uptake at 1 h for 18F-FDG is much lower than that of 18F-FBZA ( P < 0.05). The kidney uptake is another major concern for radiopharmaceuticals, being a radiosensitive organ. While there is no significant difference for the kidney uptake of 18F-FBZA and 18F-FDG at 1 h, the kidney uptake for 18F-FBZA decreases from 1 h to 2 h from 6.99 ± 3.13 to 0.93 ± 0.26 %ID/g, suggesting a faster clearance of the 18F-FBZA probe.

[Conclusion] In summary, a novel 18F-labeled PET imaging probe, 18F-FBZA, was successfully synthesized via a one step conjugation reaction between the radiosynthon, 18F-SFB and DEDA. 18F-FBZA was found to specifically target both primary and pulmonary melanotic metastastic lesions with high tumor uptakes and good tumor to normal tissue ratios. Taken together, 18F-FBZA represents a potential 18F-labeled PET imaging probe for imaging melanotic malignant melanoma and its metastases.
