Cardioprotection with ?-tocopheryl phosphate: Amelioration of myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury is linked with its ability to generate a survival signal through Akt activation The emerging potential of ?-tocopheryl phosphate, a phosphoric acid ester of ?-tocopherol, in health benefits was tested gavaging this compound (5 mg/kg body wt) to a group of rats for a period of thirty days while the control rats were given water only. After thirty days, the rats were sacrificed, the hearts excised, and the isolated hearts were perfused by working mode. Both control and experimental hearts were subjected to 30-min global ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion. The tocopheryl phosphate fed rats exhibited significant cardioprotection as evidenced by improved ventricular performance and reduced myocardial infarct size and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Supplementation with ?-tocopheryl phosphate converted MAP kinase-induced death signal into a survival signal by enhancing anti-apoptotic p42/44 ERK kinase and p38 MAPK? and reducing pro-apoptotic proteins p38 MAPK? and JNK. In concert, the phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic c-Src was also reduced. Tocopheryl phosphate increased the DNA binding of the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF?B and potentiated the activation of anti-death protein Bcl-2 and survival signaling protein Akt. The results of this study demonstrated for the first time that tocopheryl phosphate could ameliorate myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury by converting ischemia/reperfusion-mediated death signal into a survival signal by modulating MAP kinase signaling.
