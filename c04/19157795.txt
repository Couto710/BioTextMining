Mutations in the desmoglein 1 gene in five Pakistani families with striate palmoplantar keratoderma Summary Background Striate palmoplantar keratoderma (SPPK; OMIM #148700) is a rare autosomal dominant genodermatosis characterized by linear hyperkeratosis on the digits and hyperkeratosis on the palms and soles. SPPK is known to be caused by heterozygous mutations in either the desmoglein 1 ( DSG1 ), desmoplakin ( DSP ), or keratin 1 ( KRT1 ) genes. Objective To define the molecular basis of SPPK in five Pakistani families showing a clear autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of SPPK. Methods Based on previous reports of DSG1 mutations in SPPK, we performed direct sequencing of the DSG1 gene of all five families. Results Mutation analysis resulted in the identification of one recurrent mutation (p.R26X) and four novel mutations (c.Ivs4-2A>G, c.515C>T, c.Ivs9-3C>G, and c.1399delA) in the DSG1 gene. Each mutation is predicted to cause haploinsufficiency of DSG1 protein. Conclusion The results of our study further underscore the significance of the desmoglein gene family in diseases of epidermal integrity.
