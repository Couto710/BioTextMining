Long-term estrogen exposure promotes carcinogen bioactivation, induces persistent changes in gene expression, and enhances the tumorigenicity of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells The cumulative exposure to estrogens is an important determinant in the risk of breast cancer, yet the full range of mechanisms involving estrogens in the genesis and progression of breast cancer remains a subject of debate. Interactions of estrogens and environmental toxicants have received attention as putative factors contributing to carcinogenesis. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated interactions between estrogen receptor ? (ER?) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), with consequences on the genes that they regulate. Many studies of ER? and AhR-mediated effects and crosstalk between them have focused on the initial molecular events. In this study, we investigated ER?- and AhR-mediated effects in long-term estrogen exposed (LTEE) MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, which were obtained by continuous culturing for at least 12 weeks in medium supplemented with 1 nM of 17?-estradiol (E2). With these LTEE cells and with parallel control cells cultured without E2 supplementation, we performed an extensive study of cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction, carcinogen bioactivation, global gene expression, and tumorigenicity in immunocompromised mice. We found that LTEE cells, in comparison with control cells, had higher levels of AhR mRNA and protein, greater responsiveness for AhR-regulated CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 induction, a 6-fold higher initial level of benzo( a )pyrene-DNA adducts as determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, marked differences in the expression of numerous genes, and a higher rate of E2-dependent tumor growth as xenografts. These studies indicate that LTEE causes adaptive responses in MCF-7 cells, which may reflect processes that contribute to the overall carcinogenic effect of E2.  Introduction Estrogens have long been associated with breast cancer ( Clemons and Goss, 2001 ; Eliassen et al., 2006 ; Tamimi et al., 2007 ; Yager and Davidson, 2006 ; Clamp et al., 2002 ). It is thought a woman’s cumulative exposure to estrogens is an important determinant of her risk for the disease. A major proof of principle regarding the role of estrogen in breast cancer emerged from the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial with the selective estrogen receptor modulator, tamoxifen, showing a significant 45% decrease in incidence of breast cancer relative to the placebo-control group ( Fisher et al., 2005 ). Despite some risks associated with the use of tamoxifen, these results were received with optimism, since for the first time a significant reduction in breast cancer incidence was enabled through pharmacologic intervention. Therapeutic or preventive approaches in use or in development for breast cancer that focus on modulation of estrogen function include the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators ( Jordan and Brodie, 2007 ; Vogel et al., 2006 ; Goss et al., 2005 ), aromatase inhibitors ( Jordan and Brodie, 2007 ; Goss et al., 2005 ; Freedman et al., 2006 ; Budzar et al., 2008), selective estrogen-receptor down-regulators (Whittmann et al., 2007), and ovarian ablation ( The Adjuvant Breast Cancer Trials Collective Group, 2007 ). The promotion and progression phases of carcinogenesis are thought to extend over many years, and the cumulative risk of the disease increases over the course of a woman’s adult life. Long-term changes in the cellular, biochemical, and genetic properties of a tumor appear to be integral to the progression from carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma with metastatic potential. Estrogens cause the distinct developmental phenomena of genomic and gene imprinting, resulting in persistent alterations in gene expression that occur via non-mutagenic mechanisms (McLauchlan et al., 2001); recent studies suggest that estrogen-induced epigenetic changes similar to those that occur in early development are involved in breast cancer ( Cheng et al., 2008 ). The hypothesis that we consider here is that the spectrum of estrogen-induced responses in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers, and the magnitudes of these effects, are not static, but vary over time during tumor development. We suggest that these changes alter the cellular responses to carcinogens. To investigate this hypothesis, we undertook studies with the ER-positive human breast carcinoma cell line, MCF-7, which is classified as a luminal A tumor, based on its gene expression pattern (Jonnsson et al., 2007). We maintained MCF-7 cultures continuously in media that differed only by the presence or absence of physiologic concentrations of E2. With these cultures, we performed an extensive study of cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction, carcinogen bioactivation, global gene expression, and tumorigenicity as xenografts in immunocompromised mice.  Materials and methods Cell culture and treatments The MCF-7 cells used in this study were those used previously ( Spink et al., 1990 ; 1998 ; 2003a , b ), and were subjected to a minimum of 12 weeks of long-term estrogen exposure (LTEE) in DC5 medium supplemented with 0.01, 0.1, or 1 nM 17?-estradiol (E2), or in DC5 with the solvent vehicle, 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). DC5 medium, which is very low in estrogens ( Spink et al., 2003b ), consisted of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) bovine calf serum (Cosmic calf serum; Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 10 mM nonessential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 µg/L insulin, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. The DF5 medium used in some experiments differed from DC5 in that it contained 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) rather than bovine calf serum, and in that phenol red was included. Cultures were passaged approximately every 9 days, using 1:10 subculturing. Unless otherwise indicated, experiments were initiated by seeding of cells in DC5 medium and culturing to confluence, with one medium change. Cultures were then exposed, in DC5 medium, to one or more of the following compounds: 100 nM ICI 182,780, or fulvestrant (Tocris, Ellisville, MO), 10 µM ?-naphthoflavone (ANF; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 200 nM 2,3?,4,5?-tetramethoxystilbene (TMS; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI), 10 nM 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo- p -dioxin (TCDD; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA), and 0.01 or 0.1 µM benzo( a )pyrene (BAP; AccuStandard, New Haven, CT). LTEE cells, in our terminology, denote the cells cultured in DC5 medium supplemented with 1 nM E2 for 12 or more weeks, and control cells refer to those cells cultured in parallel, in DC5 medium with vehicle. For short-term exposures, conditioned medium recovered from control cultures after ?48 h of exposure was used as described previously ( Spink et al., 2003a ), to avoid the transient induction of CYP1 activity that occurs upon medium change ( Öberg et al., 2005 ) Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay LTEE cells and control cells were seeded in DC5 medium and grown to confluence without a medium change before chemical exposures in DC5 or conditioned medium. Cells were exposed for 72 h to 10 nM TCDD, or for 3 h to 0.01 or 0.1 µM BAP. EROD assays were performed using the 96-well plate procedure ( Spink et al., 2003a ). After treatments, the medium was replaced with medium (100 µL/well) containing 4 µM ethoxyresorufin and 10 µM dicumarol, and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Fluorescence measurements were made using a Fusion Universal Microplate Analyzer 5 (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT) with 535-nm excitation and 590-nm emission filters. Total protein was determined with the BCA Protein assay reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Reverse transcription and real-time PCR LTEE and control cells were cultured to confluence in 6-well plates and treated with TCDD or BAP as described for the EROD assay. Isolation of total RNA with guanidine thiocyanate and phenol, reverse transcription of oligo-dT-primed RNA with Superscript II or III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and real-time PCR using the LightCycler System with the FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) were performed as described ( Spink et al., 2003b ). cDNA templates corresponding to 10 to 20 ng total RNA were amplified with primers specific for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), CYP1A1, CYP1B1, ER?, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), and 36B4 cDNAs, as described ( Spink et al., 2003b ). ABCG2 cDNA was amplified with the primers 5’-AACTTCTGCCCAGGACTCAA-3’ and 5’-GATGGCAAGGGAACAGAAAA-3’. cDNA was quantified by comparison of cycle numbers for unknowns to those of cDNA standards of known concentration. Western immunoblots Parallel cultures to those for RNA analysis were analyzed for protein expression by Western immunoblot. Microsomes were prepared from cultures in 15-cm dishes for the analysis of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 proteins, and total cellular lysates were prepared from cultures in 6-well plates for the analysis of ER?, AhR, and actin proteins. Total protein content in the microsome and lysate samples was quantified using the BCA Protein assay reagent (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein were subjected to electrophoresis in 10% acrylamide NuPAGE Bis-Tris denaturing gels (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Proteins were blotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bethesda, MD), and blots were then probed as described ( Spink et al., 2003b ) with goat polyclonal anti-rat CYP1A1/2 antibody (Daiichi, Tokyo, Japan), rabbit polyclonal anti-human CYP1B1 antibody (BD Gentest, Bedford, MA), goat polyclonal anti-human actin antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-human AhR antibody, or rabbit polyclonal anti-human ER? antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by using the West Pico Enhanced Chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). For the analysis of ABCG2 protein, Western blots of microsomes were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-BCRP antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) at 1:250 dilution. CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 promoter activities Plasmids for analysis of promoter activities were the human CYP1A1-promoter-luciferase construct, pHu-1A1-FL ( Bessette et al., 2005 ; Spink et al., 2008 ), and the CYP1B1-promoter-luciferase construct, p1B1FLuc ( Spink et al., 2003b ). LTEE cells and control cells were seeded in 24-well plates with DC5 medium so as to be 90% confluent the following day, on which they were transfected with plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 as recommended (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were exposed to 10 nM TCDD, 1 nM E2, or 100 nM ICI 182,780 for 6 h. The cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter 1000 Assay System as described ( Spink et al., 2003b ), with the exception that the phRG-TK Renilla luciferase construct (Promega, Madison, WI), transfected at 50 ng/well, was used for normalization. Incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]BAP into cellular DNA The binding of BAP to cellular DNA was performed as described ( Wen and Walle, 2007 ), with modifications. Confluent cultures in 6-well plates were treated with 0.1 µM [G-3H]-BAP (78 Ci/mmol, 5 mCi/mL; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) with DMSO as the vehicle, in conditioned medium. After exposure to 3H-BAP, the cells were rinsed twice with PBS, lysed by addition of 0.4 mL of cell lysis solution, and genomic DNA was isolated by use of the Puregene DNA purification kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The quantity and the purity of DNA were determined by UV absorbance, and the quantity of 3H-BAP bound to DNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS/MS) analysis of BAP-DNA adduct formation An LC-ESI/MS/MS method employing synthetic standards and quantitation by stable isotope dilution was used to determine BAP adducts at N 2 of dG, in DNA from LTEE and control cultures that had been exposed to 0.1 µM BAP for 3 h. The (±)-anti-10-(deoxyquanosin- N 2-yl)-7,8,9-trihydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-benzo( a )pyrene (dG- N 2-BAP) adduct was synthesized by reaction of (±)- r -7, t -8-dihydroxy- t -9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[ a ]pyrene (BPDE; 2.5 mg, 8.1 µmol; NCI Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repository, Midwest Research Institute, Kansas City, MO) with dG (25 mg, 88 µmol) in 10 ml of 10 mM Bis-tris buffer (pH 7.5) as described ( Beland et al., 2005 ). The 13C10-labeled internal standard was synthesized in an analogous way, but using [13C10]dG (>99% isotopic purity; Spectra Stable Isotopes, Columbia, MD). The standard was purified by preparative HPLC ( Turesky et al., 1992 ), and its concentration was determined by UV spectroscopy ( Pulkrabek et al., 1979 ). Under these chromatographic conditions and the LC-ESI/MS/MS conditions described below, the four stereoisomers of dG- N 2-BAP were unresolved. DNA (100 µg) was digested with DNAse I, nuclease P1, alkaline phosphatase, and phosphodiesterase I as described ( Goodenough et al., 2007 ). Cold ethanol was added to precipitate protein and salt. The supernatant was concentrated to dryness by vacuum centrifugation, and adducts were enriched by solid-phase extraction with Hypersep™ C-18 Filter SpinTips (10 – 200 µL; Thermo Fisher). LC-ESI/MS/MS analyses were conducted on a Finnigan™ TSQ Quantum Ultra™ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA), equipped with an Ion Max™ electrospray ionization source operating in positive ionization mode, and controlled with Xcalibur software (version 1.4; Thermo Electron). The instrument tuning parameters used were as follows: source spray voltage, 2.5 kV; nitrogen sheath gas, setting 1; capillary temperature, 250 °C; tube lens offset, 103 V; and in-source collision-induced dissociation offset, 5 V. For LC-ESI/MS/MS, the collision energy was 30 eV and the collision gas was argon at 1.5 mTorr. The MS/MS transitions recorded in the selected-reaction-monitoring mode were: m/z 570.2 • 257.2 and m/z 580.2 • 257.2, for dG- N 2-BAP and [13C10]dG- N 2-BAP, respectively, each with a dwell time of 0.05 s ( Beland et al., 2005 ). Chromatography was performed with an Agilent (Palo Alto, CA) 1100 capillary LC equipped with an Aquasil C18 column (5 µm particle size, 0.5 × 250 mm; Thermo Fisher, Bellefonte, PA) using solvent A, consisting of 0.05% HCO2H, 89.95% H2O, and 10% CH3CN, and solvent B, consisting of 0.05% HCO2H, 5% H2O, and 94.95% CH3CN. The gradient program consisted of a hold at 100% A for 1 min, a linear gradient to 100% B over 30 min, a hold at 100% B for 5 min, regeneration to starting conditions for 2 min, and post-run re-equilibration for 8 min. The flow rate was 12 µL/min. BAP-modified, calf thymus DNA with 1.15 adducts per 106 DNA nucleotides, a generous gift of Dr. Frederick Beland of the National Center for Toxicological Research, Jefferson AR ( Beland et al., 2005 ), was diluted with salmon sperm DNA as carrier to 1.0 adduct per 107 nucleotides. A calibration curve was produced with a fixed amount of internal standard (5.8 pg) and 0, 1.7, 2.9, 5.7, 11.4, and 22.2 pg of dG- N 2-BAP, corresponding to 0 to 4.3 adducts per 107 nucleotides. Its slope, obtained from the plot of the response ratio against the amount ratio (unlabeled adduct/internal standard), equaled 1.10, with r 2 = 0.999. Prior to analysis, cellular DNA (100 µg) was fortified with 17.6 pg of [13C10]-dG- N 2-BAP, equivalent to 1 adduct per 107 nucleotides. Microarray analysis The microarray gene expression analyses consisted of a 2 × 2 array of samples in triplicate, with control cells, LTEE cells, control cells exposed to 10 nM TCDD for 72 h, and LTEE cells similarly exposed to TCDD. Total RNA was isolated, and its integrity was verified with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Microarray analyses of RNA were performed at the Wadsworth Center Microarray Core using Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) HG U133A 2.0 arrays and the Affymetrix GeneChip system. Gene expression data were analyzed using GeneSpring GX 10 software (Agilent). Summarization of gene expression data was performed by implementing the robust multichip averaging algorithm, with subsequent baseline normalization of the log-summarized values for each probe set to that of the median log-summarized value for the same probe set in the control group. Expression data were then filtered to remove probe sets for which the signal intensities for all four of the treatment groups were in the lowest 20 percentile of all intensity values. The data were then subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA), incorporating the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR multiple testing correction, with a significance level of P <0.05. For Gene Ontology (GO) analyses, data sets were first normalized using the GeneTraffic Uno software package (version 3; Iobion); GenMAPP (version 2; http://www.GenMAPP.org ) (Dalquist et al.,2002) was then used to sort the data. MAPPFinder ( Doniger et al., 2003 ) was used to group genes that showed significant changes in expression ( P <0.05) according to the GO hierarchy based on biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. MCF-7 xenograft assays For the xenograft studies, four groups of 15 mice each received an inoculation as follows: group 1, LTEE cells; group 2, LTEE cells with E2 supplementation; group 3, control cells; and group 4, control cells with E2 supplementation. Each inoculation consisted of 1 × 106 cells in 50 µl of culture medium, injected into the surgically exposed mammary fat pads of 6- to 8-week-old severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) female mice from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY), which were under light anesthesia with isoflurane. Mice in groups 2 and 4 received E2 supplementation, which was accomplished by subcutaneous implantation of a silastic tubing capsule containing solid E2 inserted on the day of tumor implantation; the capsule provided serum levels of 1 nM ( Bennett et al., 2006 ). External palpation of mice was accomplished daily, and emerging tumors were measured with Vernier calipers several times per week for 61 to 72 days. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula V = ?/6(d)2D, assuming the tumor shape to be ellipsoidal with D as the long axis. The latency of tumor formation is the day at which the maximal incidence of tumor formation within the group is observed by palpation. The Albany Medical College Animal Care and Use Committee approved all work with animals. Statistical evaluations Statistical evaluations of biochemical determinations, including EROD activity, luciferase assays, RNA levels, and BAP adduct levels, were performed in replicates of three or more by analysis of variance and the Bonferroni t -test for multiple comparisons. Statistical evaluations for comparisons of tumor volumes were performed with the Mann-Whitney rank sum test.  Cell culture and treatments The MCF-7 cells used in this study were those used previously ( Spink et al., 1990 ; 1998 ; 2003a , b ), and were subjected to a minimum of 12 weeks of long-term estrogen exposure (LTEE) in DC5 medium supplemented with 0.01, 0.1, or 1 nM 17?-estradiol (E2), or in DC5 with the solvent vehicle, 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Prior to analysis, cellular DNA (100 µg) was fortified with 17.6 pg of [13C10]-dG- N 2-BAP, equivalent to 1 adduct per 107 nucleotides.  Microarray analysis The microarray gene expression analyses consisted of a 2 × 2 array of samples in triplicate, with control cells, LTEE cells, control cells exposed to 10 nM TCDD for 72 h, and LTEE cells similarly exposed to TCDD. Total RNA was isolated, and its integrity was verified with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Microarray analyses of RNA were performed at the Wadsworth Center Microarray Core using Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) HG U133A 2.0 arrays and the Affymetrix GeneChip system. Gene expression data were analyzed using GeneSpring GX 10 software (Agilent). Summarization of gene expression data was performed by implementing the robust multichip averaging algorithm, with subsequent baseline normalization of the log-summarized values for each probe set to that of the median log-summarized value for the same probe set in the control group. Expression data were then filtered to remove probe sets for which the signal intensities for all four of the treatment groups were in the lowest 20 percentile of all intensity values. The data were then subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA), incorporating the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR multiple testing correction, with a significance level of P <0.05. For Gene Ontology (GO) analyses, data sets were first normalized using the GeneTraffic Uno software package (version 3; Iobion); GenMAPP (version 2; http://www.GenMAPP.org ) (Dalquist et al.,2002) was then used to sort the data. MAPPFinder ( Doniger et al., 2003 ) was used to group genes that showed significant changes in expression ( P <0.05) according to the GO hierarchy based on biological process, cellular component, and molecular function.  MCF-7 xenograft assays For the xenograft studies, four groups of 15 mice each received an inoculation as follows: group 1, LTEE cells; group 2, LTEE cells with E2 supplementation; group 3, control cells; and group 4, control cells with E2 supplementation. Each inoculation consisted of 1 × 106 cells in 50 µl of culture medium, injected into the surgically exposed mammary fat pads of 6- to 8-week-old severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) female mice from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY), which were under light anesthesia with isoflurane. Mice in groups 2 and 4 received E2 supplementation, which was accomplished by subcutaneous implantation of a silastic tubing capsule containing solid E2 inserted on the day of tumor implantation; the capsule provided serum levels of 1 nM ( Bennett et al., 2006 ). External palpation of mice was accomplished daily, and emerging tumors were measured with Vernier calipers several times per week for 61 to 72 days. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula V = ?/6(d)2D, assuming the tumor shape to be ellipsoidal with D as the long axis. The latency of tumor formation is the day at which the maximal incidence of tumor formation within the group is observed by palpation. The Albany Medical College Animal Care and Use Committee approved all work with animals.  Statistical evaluations Statistical evaluations of biochemical determinations, including EROD activity, luciferase assays, RNA levels, and BAP adduct levels, were performed in replicates of three or more by analysis of variance and the Bonferroni t -test for multiple comparisons. Statistical evaluations for comparisons of tumor volumes were performed with the Mann-Whitney rank sum test.  Results LTEE MCF-7 cells show enhanced aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) responsiveness LTEE of MCF-7 cells using physiologic levels of E2 resulted in significantly higher basal and TCDD-induced EROD activities, as compared with the activities for MCF-7 cultures without E2 supplementation ( Fig. 1A ). This result indicates a persistent effect of LTEE on CYP1-catalyzed EROD activity, given that the added E2 was present during 12 weeks of culture prior to the experiment, whereas all of the manipulations, including subculture, proliferation to confluence, TCDD exposure, and the EROD assay were performed with DC5 medium without added E2. LTEE with 1.0 nM E2 caused approximately 3-fold higher basal and TCDD-induced EROD activities. LTEE with 0.01 and 0.1 nM E2 showed lesser, although statistically significant, elevations in EROD activity. The enzyme activities of cultures continuously maintained in DF5 medium, containing fetal serum rather than calf serum, are shown for comparison. Consistent with the findings of a previous study ( Spink et al., 2003b ), MCF-7 cells continuously maintained in DC5 medium showed significantly lower basal and TCDD-induced EROD activities than did cultures maintained in DF5 medium. To investigate whether the observed effects of LTEE on basal and TCDD-induced EROD activity reflect changes at the level of mRNA expression, we analyzed levels of several mRNAs relevant to the Ah response for CYP1 induction. Control and LTEE cultures undergoing continuous exposure to 1 nM E2 were treated for 72 h with either 10 nM TCDD or vehicle, 0.1% DMSO. Real-time PCR of reverse-transcribed RNA isolated from the LTEE cultures showed significantly higher AhR mRNA levels (> 4-fold) compared with the levels for the controls ( Fig. 1B ). In both control and LTEE cultures, the levels of AhR mRNA were not affected by treatment with TCDD ( Fig. 1B ). In contrast to the effects on expression of AhR mRNA, expression of mRNA encoding the AhR dimerization partner, ARNT, was not significantly affected by LTEE. The level of ER? mRNA was approximately 45% lower in LTEE cells than in control cells, and was not significantly affected by TCDD. LTEE resulted in higher expression levels of the TCDD-induced CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs, by 3.3- and 3.7-fold, respectively. Levels of the 36B4 mRNA, which encodes a ribosomal protein and is commonly used as an E2-independent control transcript, showed little difference in expression among the treatment groups. Having established that LTEE results in greater levels of EROD activity in response to TCDD exposure and elevates the levels of AhR, CYP1A1, and CYP1B1 mRNA, we then investigated whether similar changes were evident at the level of protein expression. Analyses by Western blot confirmed that AhR expression was up-regulated by LTEE; continuous exposure to 0.01, 0.10 or 1.0 nM E2 for 12 weeks induced higher levels of AhR protein expression, relative to the control ( Fig. 1C ). Under each of the long-term culture conditions, exposure to 10 nM TCDD for 72 h caused down-regulation of AhR protein expression, presumably due to ligand-induced, proteasomal degradation of the AhR ( Davarinos and Pollenz, 1999 ). Induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 proteins by TCDD was enhanced by LTEE with 0.01, 0.10, and 1.0 nM E2. Effects of LTEE and the antiestrogen, ICI 182,780, on TCDD-induced CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 promoter activity We next investigated whether the AhR-mediated activation of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 gene transcription in LTEE cells requires the continued presence of estrogen and is subject to inhibition by the antiestrogen, ICI 182,780. For these experiments, control and LTEE cultures were subcultured in DC5 medium without added E2, and were transfected with CYP1-promoter-luciferase constructs. Cultures then were treated with E2, ICI 182,780, or TCDD for 6 h. Short-term exposure of control or LTEE cell cultures to E2 resulted in a modest up-regulation of TCDD-induced CYP1B1-promoter activity and a modest down-regulation of CYP1A1-promoter activity, whereas LTEE enhanced the TCDD-induced CYP1A1- and CYP1B1-promoter activities by 3.9- and 2.7-fold, respectively ( Fig. 2A ). The modest increases in CYP1B1 promoter activity as a result of short-term exposure to E2 were reversed by co-exposure to ICI 182,780. To further evaluate the persistence of LTEE on AhR-regulated promoter activities, we examined the effect of ICI 182,780 in the absence of added E2 on TCDD- inducible CYP1 promoter activities in control cells, LTEE cells, and LTEE cells that had been depleted of E2 for 19 days, during which time the cells underwent approximately 5 doublings. CYP1A1- promoter activity was not affected by ICI 182,780, and CYP1B1 promoter activity was only modestly inhibited by the antiestrogen ( Fig. 2B ). In LTEE cells depleted of E2 for 19 days, there was some diminution of CYP1 promoter activities, but the activity levels remained significantly higher than in control cells. These results show that the effects of LTEE on TCDD-induced CYP1 promoter activities (i) greatly exceed those of short-term E2 exposure, (ii) are weakly sensitive to ICI 182,780, and (iii) persist after E2 depletion. LTEE results in increased initial levels of <sup>3</sup>H-BAP-DNA adducts CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 are prominent enzymes in the metabolic activation of BAP and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carcinogens ( Shimada et al., 1996 ); we therefore investigated the effect of LTEE on BAP-DNA adduct formation. For these experiments, LTEE cells and control cells were subcultured using DC5 medium without added E2. At confluence, cultures were exposed to 0.1 µM 3H-BAP in conditioned medium. At the times indicated, DNA was isolated, and the levels of DNA-bound 3H-BAP were determined ( Fig. 3A ). A higher initial level of 3H-BAP bound to DNA was observed in the LTEE cultures than in the control cultures. At 2 h and 3 h of exposure to 3H-BAP, levels of DNA-bound 3H-BAP in LTEE cells were respectively 5.4- and 4.2-fold higher than levels at the same time points in control cells. A higher maximal level of DNA-bound 3H-BAP was observed in LTEE cultures than in control cultures, at 8 h. However, the adduct level decreased more rapidly in LTEE cultures, in the period from 8 to 42 h after 3H-BAP exposure. In other studies, similar reductions in BAP adducts with time ( Kuljukka-Rabb et al., 2001 ) were associated with p53-dependent activation of DNA repair ( Lloyd et al., 2000 ), and, in MCF-7 cells, expression of p53 protein is correlated with BAP DNA adducts ( Ramet et al., 1995 ). We then investigated the role of CYP1 enzymes in BAP-DNA adduct formation during a 3-h exposure of cells to 0.1 µM 3H-BAP. Dependence of adduct formation on CYP1 activity was evidenced in cultures that were co-exposed to the pan-CYP1 enzyme inhibitor, ANF; inclusion of this agent resulted in 84 and 95% inhibition of DNA-adduct formation, in control and LTEE cultures, respectively ( Fig. 3B ). Exposure to the CYP1B1-specific inhibitor, TMS ( Chun et al., 2001 ), resulted in reduction in levels of DNA adduct formation in both control and LTEE cultures, by 53 and 43%, respectively. The effect of a low concentration of BAP on the induction of CYP1 enzymes was evident in the levels of mRNA expression ( Fig. 4A ) in cultures treated for 3 h with BAP. Exposure to 0.1 µM BAP caused 8.7- and 4.9-fold elevations of the levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs in LTEE cells, over the levels in cultures without BAP. The BAP-induced levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs in LTEE cultures were 4.1- and 5.0-fold higher than the BAP-induced levels in control cultures. ANF or TMS were also found to significantly induce the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs in LTEE cultures. In co-exposure experiments, ANF significantly inhibited induction of both the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs by BAP in LTEE cultures, consistent with the previously reported AhR antagonist activity of ANF. TMS caused a slight enhancement of BAP-induced CYP1A1 mRNA expression, and a modest diminution of BAP-induced CYP1B1 mRNA expression. Concomitant with the rapid rise in DNA-adduct formation after BAP exposure, there was significant induction of CYP1 activity when measured 3 h after BAP administration, by EROD assay ( Fig. 4B ). Similar to the pattern observed for the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs, the level of BAP-induced EROD activity in LTEE cultures greatly exceeded the level in the control cultures, by 12.3- or 7.4-fold, when exposure was to 0.01 or 0.1 µM BAP, respectively. The basal EROD activity and the activity induced by 0.01 or 0.1 µM BAP were completely inhibited by inclusion of ANF, whereas TMS inhibited the EROD activity induced by 0.1 µM BAP in LTEE cells by 15%. LTEE enhances the initial formation of dG-N<sup>2</sup>-BAP adducts Having established that LTEE causes an increase in the initial level of BAP-DNA adducts, and that this enhancement is subject to inhibition by CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 inhibitors, we next investigated whether the observed DNA adduction occurred via the well-characterized pathway of metabolic activation of BAP leading to BPDE formation ( Fig. 5 ). Analysis by LC-ESI/MS/MS that was specific for dG- N 2-BAP adduct detection ( Fig. 5A, 5B ) showed a highly significant effect of LTEE on adduct formation at 3 h of BAP exposure ( Fig. 5C ). The enhancement of dG- N 2-BAP adduct formation in LTEE cultures, relative to the rate of formation in control cultures, was 6.7-fold, an effect similar in magnitude to the 5.4-fold increase of 3H-BAP adduct formation in LTEE cells, relative to control cells ( Fig. 3B ). However, the absolute levels of adducts quantified by the two methods differed greatly. Levels of adducts determined by incorporation of 3H-BAP into DNA were approximately 10-fold higher than those determined by LC-ESI/MS/MS analysis of dG- N 2-BAP. LTEE markedly alters global gene expression in MCF-7 cells To investigate the impact of LTEE on global gene expression, we performed microarray analyses with mRNA from LTEE cells and control cells, with and without exposure to 10 nM TCDD for the final 72 h. The RNA preparations used for the microarray studies were those used in the real time RT-PCR studies presented in Fig. 1B ; the LTEE cultures contained E2 continuously until the time of RNA isolation. Analysis of the microarray data identified a subset of 824 probe sets for which significant differences in expression among the 4 groups (control, control plus TCDD, LTEE, and LTEE plus TCDD) were indicated (ANOVA, P <0.05), and for which there was variation of ?2-fold in at least one of the pairwise comparisons among the four groups. A heat map of mRNA expression evaluated with these 824 probe sets is shown in Fig. 6A , displaying the effects of LTEE and TCDD exposure. Although exposure of control cells to TCDD caused changes in the expression of a number of transcripts, the effects of LTEE on gene expression without or with TCDD exposure were much more striking. In contrast to mRNAs elevated by LTEE, some other mRNAs showed decreases in level in response to LTEE; notable was the mRNA that encodes ABCG2, also known as the breast cancer resistance protein. While LTEE depressed the level of ABCG2 expression, TCDD highly induced ABCG2 expression in both control and LTEE MCF-7 cells, as determined by microarray ( Fig. 6B ), real-time PCR ( Fig. 6C ), and Western immunoblot ( Fig. 6D ). Gene expression data limited to the subset of 824 probe sets described above and in Fig 6A are summarized as (i) responses that were elevated or depressed ?2-fold in LTEE cells, as compared with responses in control cells ( Supplementary Table 1 ); (ii) responses that were elevated or depressed ?2-fold by exposure to TCDD (10 nM, 72 h) as compared with responses in control cultures without TCDD-exposure ( Supplementary Table 2 ); and (iii) responses that were elevated or depressed ?2-fold by TCDD exposure in LTEE cells as compared with responses in LTEE cells ( Supplementary Table 3 ). In LTEE cultures, data for 345 probe sets indicated expression increases by ?2-fold, and 156 depressions by ?2-fold, relative to the controls ( Supplemental Table I ). There were numerous indications of AhR/ER? interactive effects on gene expression: of the 345 probe sets that indicated ?2-fold elevated expression in LTEE cultures, 13 showed further enhancement of expression by TCDD exposure at least 2-fold over the expression observed with LTEE only, and 89 of these showed an anti-estrogenic effect of TCDD, defined as ?50% diminution of the enhancement of expression of genes from LTEE cells, when co-exposed to TCDD. Among the genes that were more highly expressed in LTEE cultures compared with control cultures (?2-fold), a number of human genes or their rodent orthologs have been previously reported to be regulated by estrogen: S100A7 ( Moog-Lutz et al., 1995 ), AREG ( Martinez-Lacaci et al., 1995 ), IFI27 ( Rasmussen et al., 1993 ), PDZK1 ( Ghosh et al., 2000 ), SCNN1A ( Soulez and Parker, 2001 ; Bourdeau et al., 2004 ), SERPINA5 ( Soulez and Parker, 2001 ; Bourdeau et al., 2004 ), C3 ( Middleton and Linder, 1993 ; Li et al, 2002 ), CP ( Middleton and Linder, 1993 ; Stuckey et al, 2006 ), WISP2 (Inadera et al., 2000), MGP ( Sheikh et al., 1993 ), PLAT ( Ryan et al., 1984 ), SERPINE1 ( Smith et al., 2004 ), BF ( Li et al., 2002 ), SERPINA3 ( Yamamura et al., 2004 ), ABCC3 ( Vendrell et al., 2004 ), NPY1R ( Amlal et al., 2006 ) SLPI ( Shimoya et al., 2006 ), ISG20 ( Pentecost, 1998 ), PGR ( Nardulli et al., 1988 ; Coser et al., 2003 ), GJA1 ( Petrocelli and Lye, 1993 ) PRSS23 ( Cunliffe et al.,2003 ; Coser et al., 2003 ) FRK ( Coser et al., 2003 ), CYP1B1 ( Spink et al., 2003b ; Labhart et al., 2005 ), EGR3 ( Inoue et al., 2004 ), TGFA ( Kenney et al., 1993 ), CTSD ( Cavailles et al, 1988 ), and GREB1 ( Ghosh et al., 2000 ). In LTEE cultures, there were also genes that are down-regulated in expression, relative to their transcript abundances in the control cultures. Human genes or their rodent orthologs that have been previously reported to be down-regulated in expression by E2, and that were down-regulated in our studies (?2-fold), include: GRB14 ( Kairouz et al., 2005 ); TNFRSF11B ( Rachner et al., 2008 ), CAV1 ( Zschocke et al., 2002 ). CAV2 ( Zschocke et al, 2002 ). CRY2 (Nakamura et al., 2004), CLU ( So et al., 2005 ), IL1R1 ( Santen et al., 2005 ; Coser et al., 2003 ), IGFBP5 (Inoue et al., 2002), EFEMP1 (Inoue et al., 2002), PSCA ( Coser et al., 2003 ) KCNJ8 ( Coser et al., 2003 ), and CTNND2 ( Coser et al., 2003 ). Differences in gene expression patterns among treatment groups were analyzed with the MAPPFinder tool (Dalquist et al., 2002). Only two GO terms were found in the first pairwise comparison, which was between control cells and control cells exposed to TCDD. In contrast, 60 GO terms were found in the second comparison, which evaluated RNA expression in LTEE cells and in control cells, and 75 GO terms were found in the third comparison, which evaluated RNA expression in LTEE cells and in TCDD-exposed LTEE cells. For the second and third comparisons, several similar GO terms were observed, reflecting the effects of LTEE and, in some instances, the anti-estrogenic effects of TCDD ( Spink et al., 1990 ; Safe et al., 2000 ). In general, expression of genes related to the cell cycle, including regulation of mitosis and the mitotic checkpoint, was up-regulated by LTEE, and was down-regulated by the addition of TCDD to LTEE cells. Expression of genes related to the response to reactive oxygen species and DNA polymerization was also elevated by LTEE. Expression of genes related to cellular development and morphogenesis was down-regulated by LTEE; however, expression of genes related to cellular morphogenesis was also down-regulated in LTEE cells exposed to TCDD. Expression of genes that regulate cell death, apoptosis, and immune response was up-regulated in LTEE cells, whereas the addition of TCDD to LTEE cells resulted in the down-regulation of the expression of genes involved in the negative regulation of apoptosis and the up-regulation of gene expression related to prostaglandin metabolism. GO terms that were unique to TCDD effects in LTEE cells included many cellular metabolic processes. The complete list of GO terms and analysis can be found in Supplementary Table 4 . LTEE enhances the rate of estrogen-dependent tumor growth in SCID mice Xenograft studies using SCID mice showed differences in development of tumors, between mice inoculated with LTEE MCF-7 cells and mice inoculated with the control MCF-7 cells ( Fig. 7 ). When the animals received E2 supplementation, both the LTEE-cell and control-cell groups showed 100% tumor incidence; i.e ., all of the animals in the E2 supplementation groups developed palpable tumors in the mammary glands. Among the groups that received E2 supplementation, there was a shorter latency to attainment of 100% tumor incidence in mice inoculated with LTEE cells than in mice inoculated with control cells. However, among the groups without E2 supplementation, there was a greater incidence of palpable tumors in the control-cell mice, 15/15 (100%), than in the LTEE-cell mice, 9/15 (60%). There were also differences in the E2-induced rates of tumor growth, dependent on whether the animals were inoculated with LTEE cells or control cells. In mice inoculated with LTEE cells and that received E2 supplementation, the tumors had grown to a mean volume of 440 mm3 by day 62, which was significantly greater than the tumor volumes in mice inoculated with control cells and that received E2 supplementation ( P <0.05); these tumors grew to only a mean volume of 62 mm3 at day 63. When the experiment was extended to day 71, the mean volume was still only 137 mm3. While the majority of the animals in the LTEE-cell and the control-cell groups that did not receive E2 supplementation developed palpable tumors, these tumors failed to grow beyond 2 mm3; these results establish that tumor growth of both LTEE cells and control cells is dependent on the continued presence of E2.  Results LTEE MCF-7 cells show enhanced aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) responsiveness LTEE of MCF-7 cells using physiologic levels of E2 resulted in significantly higher basal and TCDD-induced EROD activities, as compared with the activities for MCF-7 cultures without E2 supplementation ( Fig. 1A ). This result indicates a persistent effect of LTEE on CYP1-catalyzed EROD activity, given that the added E2 was present during 12 weeks of culture prior to the experiment, whereas all of the manipulations, including subculture, proliferation to confluence, TCDD exposure, and the EROD assay were performed with DC5 medium without added E2. LTEE with 1.0 nM E2 caused approximately 3-fold higher basal and TCDD-induced EROD activities. LTEE with 0.01 and 0.1 nM E2 showed lesser, although statistically significant, elevations in EROD activity. The enzyme activities of cultures continuously maintained in DF5 medium, containing fetal serum rather than calf serum, are shown for comparison. Consistent with the findings of a previous study ( Spink et al., 2003b ), MCF-7 cells continuously maintained in DC5 medium showed significantly lower basal and TCDD-induced EROD activities than did cultures maintained in DF5 medium. To investigate whether the observed effects of LTEE on basal and TCDD-induced EROD activity reflect changes at the level of mRNA expression, we analyzed levels of several mRNAs relevant to the Ah response for CYP1 induction. Control and LTEE cultures undergoing continuous exposure to 1 nM E2 were treated for 72 h with either 10 nM TCDD or vehicle, 0.1% DMSO. Real-time PCR of reverse-transcribed RNA isolated from the LTEE cultures showed significantly higher AhR mRNA levels (> 4-fold) compared with the levels for the controls ( Fig. 1B ). In both control and LTEE cultures, the levels of AhR mRNA were not affected by treatment with TCDD ( Fig. 1B ). In contrast to the effects on expression of AhR mRNA, expression of mRNA encoding the AhR dimerization partner, ARNT, was not significantly affected by LTEE. The level of ER? mRNA was approximately 45% lower in LTEE cells than in control cells, and was not significantly affected by TCDD. LTEE resulted in higher expression levels of the TCDD-induced CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs, by 3.3- and 3.7-fold, respectively. Levels of the 36B4 mRNA, which encodes a ribosomal protein and is commonly used as an E2-independent control transcript, showed little difference in expression among the treatment groups. Having established that LTEE results in greater levels of EROD activity in response to TCDD exposure and elevates the levels of AhR, CYP1A1, and CYP1B1 mRNA, we then investigated whether similar changes were evident at the level of protein expression. Analyses by Western blot confirmed that AhR expression was up-regulated by LTEE; continuous exposure to 0.01, 0.10 or 1.0 nM E2 for 12 weeks induced higher levels of AhR protein expression, relative to the control ( Fig. 1C ). Under each of the long-term culture conditions, exposure to 10 nM TCDD for 72 h caused down-regulation of AhR protein expression, presumably due to ligand-induced, proteasomal degradation of the AhR ( Davarinos and Pollenz, 1999 ). Induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 proteins by TCDD was enhanced by LTEE with 0.01, 0.10, and 1.0 nM E2. Effects of LTEE and the antiestrogen, ICI 182,780, on TCDD-induced CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 promoter activity We next investigated whether the AhR-mediated activation of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 gene transcription in LTEE cells requires the continued presence of estrogen and is subject to inhibition by the antiestrogen, ICI 182,780. For these experiments, control and LTEE cultures were subcultured in DC5 medium without added E2, and were transfected with CYP1-promoter-luciferase constructs. Cultures then were treated with E2, ICI 182,780, or TCDD for 6 h. Short-term exposure of control or LTEE cell cultures to E2 resulted in a modest up-regulation of TCDD-induced CYP1B1-promoter activity and a modest down-regulation of CYP1A1-promoter activity, whereas LTEE enhanced the TCDD-induced CYP1A1- and CYP1B1-promoter activities by 3.9- and 2.7-fold, respectively ( Fig. 2A ). The modest increases in CYP1B1 promoter activity as a result of short-term exposure to E2 were reversed by co-exposure to ICI 182,780. To further evaluate the persistence of LTEE on AhR-regulated promoter activities, we examined the effect of ICI 182,780 in the absence of added E2 on TCDD- inducible CYP1 promoter activities in control cells, LTEE cells, and LTEE cells that had been depleted of E2 for 19 days, during which time the cells underwent approximately 5 doublings. CYP1A1- promoter activity was not affected by ICI 182,780, and CYP1B1 promoter activity was only modestly inhibited by the antiestrogen ( Fig. 2B ). In LTEE cells depleted of E2 for 19 days, there was some diminution of CYP1 promoter activities, but the activity levels remained significantly higher than in control cells. These results show that the effects of LTEE on TCDD-induced CYP1 promoter activities (i) greatly exceed those of short-term E2 exposure, (ii) are weakly sensitive to ICI 182,780, and (iii) persist after E2 depletion. LTEE results in increased initial levels of <sup>3</sup>H-BAP-DNA adducts CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 are prominent enzymes in the metabolic activation of BAP and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carcinogens ( Shimada et al., 1996 ); we therefore investigated the effect of LTEE on BAP-DNA adduct formation. For these experiments, LTEE cells and control cells were subcultured using DC5 medium without added E2. At confluence, cultures were exposed to 0.1 µM 3H-BAP in conditioned medium. At the times indicated, DNA was isolated, and the levels of DNA-bound 3H-BAP were determined ( Fig. 3A ). A higher initial level of 3H-BAP bound to DNA was observed in the LTEE cultures than in the control cultures. At 2 h and 3 h of exposure to 3H-BAP, levels of DNA-bound 3H-BAP in LTEE cells were respectively 5.4- and 4.2-fold higher than levels at the same time points in control cells. A higher maximal level of DNA-bound 3H-BAP was observed in LTEE cultures than in control cultures, at 8 h. However, the adduct level decreased more rapidly in LTEE cultures, in the period from 8 to 42 h after 3H-BAP exposure. In other studies, similar reductions in BAP adducts with time ( Kuljukka-Rabb et al., 2001 ) were associated with p53-dependent activation of DNA repair ( Lloyd et al., 2000 ), and, in MCF-7 cells, expression of p53 protein is correlated with BAP DNA adducts ( Ramet et al., 1995 ). We then investigated the role of CYP1 enzymes in BAP-DNA adduct formation during a 3-h exposure of cells to 0.1 µM 3H-BAP. Dependence of adduct formation on CYP1 activity was evidenced in cultures that were co-exposed to the pan-CYP1 enzyme inhibitor, ANF; inclusion of this agent resulted in 84 and 95% inhibition of DNA-adduct formation, in control and LTEE cultures, respectively ( Fig. 3B ). Exposure to the CYP1B1-specific inhibitor, TMS ( Chun et al., 2001 ), resulted in reduction in levels of DNA adduct formation in both control and LTEE cultures, by 53 and 43%, respectively. The effect of a low concentration of BAP on the induction of CYP1 enzymes was evident in the levels of mRNA expression ( Fig. 4A ) in cultures treated for 3 h with BAP. Exposure to 0.1 µM BAP caused 8.7- and 4.9-fold elevations of the levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs in LTEE cells, over the levels in cultures without BAP. The BAP-induced levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs in LTEE cultures were 4.1- and 5.0-fold higher than the BAP-induced levels in control cultures. ANF or TMS were also found to significantly induce the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs in LTEE cultures. In co-exposure experiments, ANF significantly inhibited induction of both the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs by BAP in LTEE cultures, consistent with the previously reported AhR antagonist activity of ANF. TMS caused a slight enhancement of BAP-induced CYP1A1 mRNA expression, and a modest diminution of BAP-induced CYP1B1 mRNA expression. Concomitant with the rapid rise in DNA-adduct formation after BAP exposure, there was significant induction of CYP1 activity when measured 3 h after BAP administration, by EROD assay ( Fig. 4B ). Similar to the pattern observed for the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs, the level of BAP-induced EROD activity in LTEE cultures greatly exceeded the level in the control cultures, by 12.3- or 7.4-fold, when exposure was to 0.01 or 0.1 µM BAP, respectively. The basal EROD activity and the activity induced by 0.01 or 0.1 µM BAP were completely inhibited by inclusion of ANF, whereas TMS inhibited the EROD activity induced by 0.1 µM BAP in LTEE cells by 15%. LTEE enhances the initial formation of dG-N<sup>2</sup>-BAP adducts Having established that LTEE causes an increase in the initial level of BAP-DNA adducts, and that this enhancement is subject to inhibition by CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 inhibitors, we next investigated whether the observed DNA adduction occurred via the well-characterized pathway of metabolic activation of BAP leading to BPDE formation ( Fig. 5 ). Analysis by LC-ESI/MS/MS that was specific for dG- N 2-BAP adduct detection ( Fig. 5A, 5B ) showed a highly significant effect of LTEE on adduct formation at 3 h of BAP exposure ( Fig. 5C ). The enhancement of dG- N 2-BAP adduct formation in LTEE cultures, relative to the rate of formation in control cultures, was 6.7-fold, an effect similar in magnitude to the 5.4-fold increase of 3H-BAP adduct formation in LTEE cells, relative to control cells ( Fig. 3B ). However, the absolute levels of adducts quantified by the two methods differed greatly. Levels of adducts determined by incorporation of 3H-BAP into DNA were approximately 10-fold higher than those determined by LC-ESI/MS/MS analysis of dG- N 2-BAP. LTEE markedly alters global gene expression in MCF-7 cells To investigate the impact of LTEE on global gene expression, we performed microarray analyses with mRNA from LTEE cells and control cells, with and without exposure to 10 nM TCDD for the final 72 h. The RNA preparations used for the microarray studies were those used in the real time RT-PCR studies presented in Fig. 1B ; the LTEE cultures contained E2 continuously until the time of RNA isolation. Analysis of the microarray data identified a subset of 824 probe sets for which significant differences in expression among the 4 groups (control, control plus TCDD, LTEE, and LTEE plus TCDD) were indicated (ANOVA, P <0.05), and for which there was variation of ?2-fold in at least one of the pairwise comparisons among the four groups. A heat map of mRNA expression evaluated with these 824 probe sets is shown in Fig. 6A , displaying the effects of LTEE and TCDD exposure. Although exposure of control cells to TCDD caused changes in the expression of a number of transcripts, the effects of LTEE on gene expression without or with TCDD exposure were much more striking. In contrast to mRNAs elevated by LTEE, some other mRNAs showed decreases in level in response to LTEE; notable was the mRNA that encodes ABCG2, also known as the breast cancer resistance protein. While LTEE depressed the level of ABCG2 expression, TCDD highly induced ABCG2 expression in both control and LTEE MCF-7 cells, as determined by microarray ( Fig. 6B ), real-time PCR ( Fig. 6C ), and Western immunoblot ( Fig. 6D ). Gene expression data limited to the subset of 824 probe sets described above and in Fig 6A are summarized as (i) responses that were elevated or depressed ?2-fold in LTEE cells, as compared with responses in control cells ( Supplementary Table 1 ); (ii) responses that were elevated or depressed ?2-fold by exposure to TCDD (10 nM, 72 h) as compared with responses in control cultures without TCDD-exposure ( Supplementary Table 2 ); and (iii) responses that were elevated or depressed ?2-fold by TCDD exposure in LTEE cells as compared with responses in LTEE cells ( Supplementary Table 3 ). In LTEE cultures, data for 345 probe sets indicated expression increases by ?2-fold, and 156 depressions by ?2-fold, relative to the controls ( Supplemental Table I ). There were numerous indications of AhR/ER? interactive effects on gene expression: of the 345 probe sets that indicated ?2-fold elevated expression in LTEE cultures, 13 showed further enhancement of expression by TCDD exposure at least 2-fold over the expression observed with LTEE only, and 89 of these showed an anti-estrogenic effect of TCDD, defined as ?50% diminution of the enhancement of expression of genes from LTEE cells, when co-exposed to TCDD. Among the genes that were more highly expressed in LTEE cultures compared with control cultures (?2-fold), a number of human genes or their rodent orthologs have been previously reported to be regulated by estrogen: S100A7 ( Moog-Lutz et al., 1995 ), AREG ( Martinez-Lacaci et al., 1995 ), IFI27 ( Rasmussen et al., 1993 ), PDZK1 ( Ghosh et al., 2000 ), SCNN1A ( Soulez and Parker, 2001 ; Bourdeau et al., 2004 ), SERPINA5 ( Soulez and Parker, 2001 ; Bourdeau et al., 2004 ), C3 ( Middleton and Linder, 1993 ; Li et al, 2002 ), CP ( Middleton and Linder, 1993 ; Stuckey et al, 2006 ), WISP2 (Inadera et al., 2000), MGP ( Sheikh et al., 1993 ), PLAT ( Ryan et al., 1984 ), SERPINE1 ( Smith et al., 2004 ), BF ( Li et al., 2002 ), SERPINA3 ( Yamamura et al., 2004 ), ABCC3 ( Vendrell et al., 2004 ), NPY1R ( Amlal et al., 2006 ) SLPI ( Shimoya et al., 2006 ), ISG20 ( Pentecost, 1998 ), PGR ( Nardulli et al., 1988 ; Coser et al., 2003 ), GJA1 ( Petrocelli and Lye, 1993 ) PRSS23 ( Cunliffe et al.,2003 ; Coser et al., 2003 ) FRK ( Coser et al., 2003 ), CYP1B1 ( Spink et al., 2003b ; Labhart et al., 2005 ), EGR3 ( Inoue et al., 2004 ), TGFA ( Kenney et al., 1993 ), CTSD ( Cavailles et al, 1988 ), and GREB1 ( Ghosh et al., 2000 ). In LTEE cultures, there were also genes that are down-regulated in expression, relative to their transcript abundances in the control cultures. Human genes or their rodent orthologs that have been previously reported to be down-regulated in expression by E2, and that were down-regulated in our studies (?2-fold), include: GRB14 ( Kairouz et al., 2005 ); TNFRSF11B ( Rachner et al., 2008 ), CAV1 ( Zschocke et al., 2002 ). CAV2 ( Zschocke et al, 2002 ). CRY2 (Nakamura et al., 2004), CLU ( So et al., 2005 ), IL1R1 ( Santen et al., 2005 ; Coser et al., 2003 ), IGFBP5 (Inoue et al., 2002), EFEMP1 (Inoue et al., 2002), PSCA ( Coser et al., 2003 ) KCNJ8 ( Coser et al., 2003 ), and CTNND2 ( Coser et al., 2003 ). Differences in gene expression patterns among treatment groups were analyzed with the MAPPFinder tool (Dalquist et al., 2002). Only two GO terms were found in the first pairwise comparison, which was between control cells and control cells exposed to TCDD. In contrast, 60 GO terms were found in the second comparison, which evaluated RNA expression in LTEE cells and in control cells, and 75 GO terms were found in the third comparison, which evaluated RNA expression in LTEE cells and in TCDD-exposed LTEE cells. For the second and third comparisons, several similar GO terms were observed, reflecting the effects of LTEE and, in some instances, the anti-estrogenic effects of TCDD ( Spink et al., 1990 ; Safe et al., 2000 ). In general, expression of genes related to the cell cycle, including regulation of mitosis and the mitotic checkpoint, was up-regulated by LTEE, and was down-regulated by the addition of TCDD to LTEE cells. Expression of genes related to the response to reactive oxygen species and DNA polymerization was also elevated by LTEE. Expression of genes related to cellular development and morphogenesis was down-regulated by LTEE; however, expression of genes related to cellular morphogenesis was also down-regulated in LTEE cells exposed to TCDD. Expression of genes that regulate cell death, apoptosis, and immune response was up-regulated in LTEE cells, whereas the addition of TCDD to LTEE cells resulted in the down-regulation of the expression of genes involved in the negative regulation of apoptosis and the up-regulation of gene expression related to prostaglandin metabolism. GO terms that were unique to TCDD effects in LTEE cells included many cellular metabolic processes. The complete list of GO terms and analysis can be found in Supplementary Table 4 . LTEE enhances the rate of estrogen-dependent tumor growth in SCID mice Xenograft studies using SCID mice showed differences in development of tumors, between mice inoculated with LTEE MCF-7 cells and mice inoculated with the control MCF-7 cells ( Fig. 7 ). When the animals received E2 supplementation, both the LTEE-cell and control-cell groups showed 100% tumor incidence; i.e ., all of the animals in the E2 supplementation groups developed palpable tumors in the mammary glands. Among the groups that received E2 supplementation, there was a shorter latency to attainment of 100% tumor incidence in mice inoculated with LTEE cells than in mice inoculated with control cells. However, among the groups without E2 supplementation, there was a greater incidence of palpable tumors in the control-cell mice, 15/15 (100%), than in the LTEE-cell mice, 9/15 (60%). There were also differences in the E2-induced rates of tumor growth, dependent on whether the animals were inoculated with LTEE cells or control cells. In mice inoculated with LTEE cells and that received E2 supplementation, the tumors had grown to a mean volume of 440 mm3 by day 62, which was significantly greater than the tumor volumes in mice inoculated with control cells and that received E2 supplementation ( P <0.05); these tumors grew to only a mean volume of 62 mm3 at day 63. When the experiment was extended to day 71, the mean volume was still only 137 mm3. While the majority of the animals in the LTEE-cell and the control-cell groups that did not receive E2 supplementation developed palpable tumors, these tumors failed to grow beyond 2 mm3; these results establish that tumor growth of both LTEE cells and control cells is dependent on the continued presence of E2.  LTEE MCF-7 cells show enhanced aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) responsiveness LTEE of MCF-7 cells using physiologic levels of E2 resulted in significantly higher basal and TCDD-induced EROD activities, as compared with the activities for MCF-7 cultures without E2 supplementation ( Fig. 1A ). This result indicates a persistent effect of LTEE on CYP1-catalyzed EROD activity, given that the added E2 was present during 12 weeks of culture prior to the experiment, whereas all of the manipulations, including subculture, proliferation to confluence, TCDD exposure, and the EROD assay were performed with DC5 medium without added E2. LTEE with 1.0 nM E2 caused approximately 3-fold higher basal and TCDD-induced EROD activities. LTEE with 0.01 and 0.1 nM E2 showed lesser, although statistically significant, elevations in EROD activity. The enzyme activities of cultures continuously maintained in DF5 medium, containing fetal serum rather than calf serum, are shown for comparison. Consistent with the findings of a previous study ( Spink et al., 2003b ), MCF-7 cells continuously maintained in DC5 medium showed significantly lower basal and TCDD-induced EROD activities than did cultures maintained in DF5 medium. To investigate whether the observed effects of LTEE on basal and TCDD-induced EROD activity reflect changes at the level of mRNA expression, we analyzed levels of several mRNAs relevant to the Ah response for CYP1 induction. Control and LTEE cultures undergoing continuous exposure to 1 nM E2 were treated for 72 h with either 10 nM TCDD or vehicle, 0.1% DMSO. Real-time PCR of reverse-transcribed RNA isolated from the LTEE cultures showed significantly higher AhR mRNA levels (> 4-fold) compared with the levels for the controls ( Fig. 1B ). In both control and LTEE cultures, the levels of AhR mRNA were not affected by treatment with TCDD ( Fig. 1B ). In contrast to the effects on expression of AhR mRNA, expression of mRNA encoding the AhR dimerization partner, ARNT, was not significantly affected by LTEE. The level of ER? mRNA was approximately 45% lower in LTEE cells than in control cells, and was not significantly affected by TCDD. LTEE resulted in higher expression levels of the TCDD-induced CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs, by 3.3- and 3.7-fold, respectively. Levels of the 36B4 mRNA, which encodes a ribosomal protein and is commonly used as an E2-independent control transcript, showed little difference in expression among the treatment groups. Having established that LTEE results in greater levels of EROD activity in response to TCDD exposure and elevates the levels of AhR, CYP1A1, and CYP1B1 mRNA, we then investigated whether similar changes were evident at the level of protein expression. Analyses by Western blot confirmed that AhR expression was up-regulated by LTEE; continuous exposure to 0.01, 0.10 or 1.0 nM E2 for 12 weeks induced higher levels of AhR protein expression, relative to the control ( Fig. 1C ). Under each of the long-term culture conditions, exposure to 10 nM TCDD for 72 h caused down-regulation of AhR protein expression, presumably due to ligand-induced, proteasomal degradation of the AhR ( Davarinos and Pollenz, 1999 ). Induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 proteins by TCDD was enhanced by LTEE with 0.01, 0.10, and 1.0 nM E2.  LTEE MCF-7 cells show enhanced aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) responsiveness LTEE of MCF-7 cells using physiologic levels of E2 resulted in significantly higher basal and TCDD-induced EROD activities, as compared with the activities for MCF-7 cultures without E2 supplementation ( Fig. 1A ). This result indicates a persistent effect of LTEE on CYP1-catalyzed EROD activity, given that the added E2 was present during 12 weeks of culture prior to the experiment, whereas all of the manipulations, including subculture, proliferation to confluence, TCDD exposure, and the EROD assay were performed with DC5 medium without added E2. LTEE with 1.0 nM E2 caused approximately 3-fold higher basal and TCDD-induced EROD activities. LTEE with 0.01 and 0.1 nM E2 showed lesser, although statistically significant, elevations in EROD activity. The enzyme activities of cultures continuously maintained in DF5 medium, containing fetal serum rather than calf serum, are shown for comparison. Consistent with the findings of a previous study ( Spink et al., 2003b ), MCF-7 cells continuously maintained in DC5 medium showed significantly lower basal and TCDD-induced EROD activities than did cultures maintained in DF5 medium. To investigate whether the observed effects of LTEE on basal and TCDD-induced EROD activity reflect changes at the level of mRNA expression, we analyzed levels of several mRNAs relevant to the Ah response for CYP1 induction. Control and LTEE cultures undergoing continuous exposure to 1 nM E2 were treated for 72 h with either 10 nM TCDD or vehicle, 0.1% DMSO. Real-time PCR of reverse-transcribed RNA isolated from the LTEE cultures showed significantly higher AhR mRNA levels (> 4-fold) compared with the levels for the controls ( Fig. 1B ). In both control and LTEE cultures, the levels of AhR mRNA were not affected by treatment with TCDD ( Fig. 1B ). In contrast to the effects on expression of AhR mRNA, expression of mRNA encoding the AhR dimerization partner, ARNT, was not significantly affected by LTEE. The level of ER? mRNA was approximately 45% lower in LTEE cells than in control cells, and was not significantly affected by TCDD. LTEE resulted in higher expression levels of the TCDD-induced CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs, by 3.3- and 3.7-fold, respectively. Levels of the 36B4 mRNA, which encodes a ribosomal protein and is commonly used as an E2-independent control transcript, showed little difference in expression among the treatment groups. Having established that LTEE results in greater levels of EROD activity in response to TCDD exposure and elevates the levels of AhR, CYP1A1, and CYP1B1 mRNA, we then investigated whether similar changes were evident at the level of protein expression. Analyses by Western blot confirmed that AhR expression was up-regulated by LTEE; continuous exposure to 0.01, 0.10 or 1.0 nM E2 for 12 weeks induced higher levels of AhR protein expression, relative to the control ( Fig. 1C ). Under each of the long-term culture conditions, exposure to 10 nM TCDD for 72 h caused down-regulation of AhR protein expression, presumably due to ligand-induced, proteasomal degradation of the AhR ( Davarinos and Pollenz, 1999 ). Induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 proteins by TCDD was enhanced by LTEE with 0.01, 0.10, and 1.0 nM E2.  Effects of LTEE and the antiestrogen, ICI 182,780, on TCDD-induced CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 promoter activity We next investigated whether the AhR-mediated activation of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 gene transcription in LTEE cells requires the continued presence of estrogen and is subject to inhibition by the antiestrogen, ICI 182,780. For these experiments, control and LTEE cultures were subcultured in DC5 medium without added E2, and were transfected with CYP1-promoter-luciferase constructs. Cultures then were treated with E2, ICI 182,780, or TCDD for 6 h. Short-term exposure of control or LTEE cell cultures to E2 resulted in a modest up-regulation of TCDD-induced CYP1B1-promoter activity and a modest down-regulation of CYP1A1-promoter activity, whereas LTEE enhanced the TCDD-induced CYP1A1- and CYP1B1-promoter activities by 3.9- and 2.7-fold, respectively ( Fig. 2A ). The modest increases in CYP1B1 promoter activity as a result of short-term exposure to E2 were reversed by co-exposure to ICI 182,780. To further evaluate the persistence of LTEE on AhR-regulated promoter activities, we examined the effect of ICI 182,780 in the absence of added E2 on TCDD- inducible CYP1 promoter activities in control cells, LTEE cells, and LTEE cells that had been depleted of E2 for 19 days, during which time the cells underwent approximately 5 doublings. CYP1A1- promoter activity was not affected by ICI 182,780, and CYP1B1 promoter activity was only modestly inhibited by the antiestrogen ( Fig. 2B ). In LTEE cells depleted of E2 for 19 days, there was some diminution of CYP1 promoter activities, but the activity levels remained significantly higher than in control cells. These results show that the effects of LTEE on TCDD-induced CYP1 promoter activities (i) greatly exceed those of short-term E2 exposure, (ii) are weakly sensitive to ICI 182,780, and (iii) persist after E2 depletion.  Effects of LTEE and the antiestrogen, ICI 182,780, on TCDD-induced CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 promoter activity We next investigated whether the AhR-mediated activation of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 gene transcription in LTEE cells requires the continued presence of estrogen and is subject to inhibition by the antiestrogen, ICI 182,780. For these experiments, control and LTEE cultures were subcultured in DC5 medium without added E2, and were transfected with CYP1-promoter-luciferase constructs. Cultures then were treated with E2, ICI 182,780, or TCDD for 6 h. Short-term exposure of control or LTEE cell cultures to E2 resulted in a modest up-regulation of TCDD-induced CYP1B1-promoter activity and a modest down-regulation of CYP1A1-promoter activity, whereas LTEE enhanced the TCDD-induced CYP1A1- and CYP1B1-promoter activities by 3.9- and 2.7-fold, respectively ( Fig. 2A ). The modest increases in CYP1B1 promoter activity as a result of short-term exposure to E2 were reversed by co-exposure to ICI 182,780. To further evaluate the persistence of LTEE on AhR-regulated promoter activities, we examined the effect of ICI 182,780 in the absence of added E2 on TCDD- inducible CYP1 promoter activities in control cells, LTEE cells, and LTEE cells that had been depleted of E2 for 19 days, during which time the cells underwent approximately 5 doublings. CYP1A1- promoter activity was not affected by ICI 182,780, and CYP1B1 promoter activity was only modestly inhibited by the antiestrogen ( Fig. 2B ). In LTEE cells depleted of E2 for 19 days, there was some diminution of CYP1 promoter activities, but the activity levels remained significantly higher than in control cells. These results show that the effects of LTEE on TCDD-induced CYP1 promoter activities (i) greatly exceed those of short-term E2 exposure, (ii) are weakly sensitive to ICI 182,780, and (iii) persist after E2 depletion.  LTEE results in increased initial levels of <sup>3</sup>H-BAP-DNA adducts CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 are prominent enzymes in the metabolic activation of BAP and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carcinogens ( Shimada et al., 1996 ); we therefore investigated the effect of LTEE on BAP-DNA adduct formation. For these experiments, LTEE cells and control cells were subcultured using DC5 medium without added E2. At confluence, cultures were exposed to 0.1 µM 3H-BAP in conditioned medium. At the times indicated, DNA was isolated, and the levels of DNA-bound 3H-BAP were determined ( Fig. 3A ). A higher initial level of 3H-BAP bound to DNA was observed in the LTEE cultures than in the control cultures. At 2 h and 3 h of exposure to 3H-BAP, levels of DNA-bound 3H-BAP in LTEE cells were respectively 5.4- and 4.2-fold higher than levels at the same time points in control cells. A higher maximal level of DNA-bound 3H-BAP was observed in LTEE cultures than in control cultures, at 8 h. However, the adduct level decreased more rapidly in LTEE cultures, in the period from 8 to 42 h after 3H-BAP exposure. In other studies, similar reductions in BAP adducts with time ( Kuljukka-Rabb et al., 2001 ) were associated with p53-dependent activation of DNA repair ( Lloyd et al., 2000 ), and, in MCF-7 cells, expression of p53 protein is correlated with BAP DNA adducts ( Ramet et al., 1995 ). We then investigated the role of CYP1 enzymes in BAP-DNA adduct formation during a 3-h exposure of cells to 0.1 µM 3H-BAP. Dependence of adduct formation on CYP1 activity was evidenced in cultures that were co-exposed to the pan-CYP1 enzyme inhibitor, ANF; inclusion of this agent resulted in 84 and 95% inhibition of DNA-adduct formation, in control and LTEE cultures, respectively ( Fig. 3B ). Exposure to the CYP1B1-specific inhibitor, TMS ( Chun et al., 2001 ), resulted in reduction in levels of DNA adduct formation in both control and LTEE cultures, by 53 and 43%, respectively. The effect of a low concentration of BAP on the induction of CYP1 enzymes was evident in the levels of mRNA expression ( Fig. 4A ) in cultures treated for 3 h with BAP. Exposure to 0.1 µM BAP caused 8.7- and 4.9-fold elevations of the levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs in LTEE cells, over the levels in cultures without BAP. The BAP-induced levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs in LTEE cultures were 4.1- and 5.0-fold higher than the BAP-induced levels in control cultures. ANF or TMS were also found to significantly induce the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs in LTEE cultures. In co-exposure experiments, ANF significantly inhibited induction of both the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs by BAP in LTEE cultures, consistent with the previously reported AhR antagonist activity of ANF. TMS caused a slight enhancement of BAP-induced CYP1A1 mRNA expression, and a modest diminution of BAP-induced CYP1B1 mRNA expression. Concomitant with the rapid rise in DNA-adduct formation after BAP exposure, there was significant induction of CYP1 activity when measured 3 h after BAP administration, by EROD assay ( Fig. 4B ). Similar to the pattern observed for the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs, the level of BAP-induced EROD activity in LTEE cultures greatly exceeded the level in the control cultures, by 12.3- or 7.4-fold, when exposure was to 0.01 or 0.1 µM BAP, respectively. The basal EROD activity and the activity induced by 0.01 or 0.1 µM BAP were completely inhibited by inclusion of ANF, whereas TMS inhibited the EROD activity induced by 0.1 µM BAP in LTEE cells by 15%.  LTEE results in increased initial levels of <sup>3</sup>H-BAP-DNA adducts CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 are prominent enzymes in the metabolic activation of BAP and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carcinogens ( Shimada et al., 1996 ); we therefore investigated the effect of LTEE on BAP-DNA adduct formation. For these experiments, LTEE cells and control cells were subcultured using DC5 medium without added E2. At confluence, cultures were exposed to 0.1 µM 3H-BAP in conditioned medium. At the times indicated, DNA was isolated, and the levels of DNA-bound 3H-BAP were determined ( Fig. 3A ). A higher initial level of 3H-BAP bound to DNA was observed in the LTEE cultures than in the control cultures. At 2 h and 3 h of exposure to 3H-BAP, levels of DNA-bound 3H-BAP in LTEE cells were respectively 5.4- and 4.2-fold higher than levels at the same time points in control cells. A higher maximal level of DNA-bound 3H-BAP was observed in LTEE cultures than in control cultures, at 8 h. However, the adduct level decreased more rapidly in LTEE cultures, in the period from 8 to 42 h after 3H-BAP exposure. In other studies, similar reductions in BAP adducts with time ( Kuljukka-Rabb et al., 2001 ) were associated with p53-dependent activation of DNA repair ( Lloyd et al., 2000 ), and, in MCF-7 cells, expression of p53 protein is correlated with BAP DNA adducts ( Ramet et al., 1995 ). We then investigated the role of CYP1 enzymes in BAP-DNA adduct formation during a 3-h exposure of cells to 0.1 µM 3H-BAP. Dependence of adduct formation on CYP1 activity was evidenced in cultures that were co-exposed to the pan-CYP1 enzyme inhibitor, ANF; inclusion of this agent resulted in 84 and 95% inhibition of DNA-adduct formation, in control and LTEE cultures, respectively ( Fig. 3B ). Exposure to the CYP1B1-specific inhibitor, TMS ( Chun et al., 2001 ), resulted in reduction in levels of DNA adduct formation in both control and LTEE cultures, by 53 and 43%, respectively. The effect of a low concentration of BAP on the induction of CYP1 enzymes was evident in the levels of mRNA expression ( Fig. 4A ) in cultures treated for 3 h with BAP. Exposure to 0.1 µM BAP caused 8.7- and 4.9-fold elevations of the levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs in LTEE cells, over the levels in cultures without BAP. The BAP-induced levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs in LTEE cultures were 4.1- and 5.0-fold higher than the BAP-induced levels in control cultures. ANF or TMS were also found to significantly induce the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs in LTEE cultures. In co-exposure experiments, ANF significantly inhibited induction of both the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs by BAP in LTEE cultures, consistent with the previously reported AhR antagonist activity of ANF. TMS caused a slight enhancement of BAP-induced CYP1A1 mRNA expression, and a modest diminution of BAP-induced CYP1B1 mRNA expression. Concomitant with the rapid rise in DNA-adduct formation after BAP exposure, there was significant induction of CYP1 activity when measured 3 h after BAP administration, by EROD assay ( Fig. 4B ). Similar to the pattern observed for the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs, the level of BAP-induced EROD activity in LTEE cultures greatly exceeded the level in the control cultures, by 12.3- or 7.4-fold, when exposure was to 0.01 or 0.1 µM BAP, respectively. The basal EROD activity and the activity induced by 0.01 or 0.1 µM BAP were completely inhibited by inclusion of ANF, whereas TMS inhibited the EROD activity induced by 0.1 µM BAP in LTEE cells by 15%.  LTEE enhances the initial formation of dG-N<sup>2</sup>-BAP adducts Having established that LTEE causes an increase in the initial level of BAP-DNA adducts, and that this enhancement is subject to inhibition by CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 inhibitors, we next investigated whether the observed DNA adduction occurred via the well-characterized pathway of metabolic activation of BAP leading to BPDE formation ( Fig. 5 ). Analysis by LC-ESI/MS/MS that was specific for dG- N 2-BAP adduct detection ( Fig. 5A, 5B ) showed a highly significant effect of LTEE on adduct formation at 3 h of BAP exposure ( Fig. 5C ). The enhancement of dG- N 2-BAP adduct formation in LTEE cultures, relative to the rate of formation in control cultures, was 6.7-fold, an effect similar in magnitude to the 5.4-fold increase of 3H-BAP adduct formation in LTEE cells, relative to control cells ( Fig. 3B ). However, the absolute levels of adducts quantified by the two methods differed greatly. Levels of adducts determined by incorporation of 3H-BAP into DNA were approximately 10-fold higher than those determined by LC-ESI/MS/MS analysis of dG- N 2-BAP.  LTEE enhances the initial formation of dG-N<sup>2</sup>-BAP adducts Having established that LTEE causes an increase in the initial level of BAP-DNA adducts, and that this enhancement is subject to inhibition by CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 inhibitors, we next investigated whether the observed DNA adduction occurred via the well-characterized pathway of metabolic activation of BAP leading to BPDE formation ( Fig. 5 ). Analysis by LC-ESI/MS/MS that was specific for dG- N 2-BAP adduct detection ( Fig. 5A, 5B ) showed a highly significant effect of LTEE on adduct formation at 3 h of BAP exposure ( Fig. 5C ). The enhancement of dG- N 2-BAP adduct formation in LTEE cultures, relative to the rate of formation in control cultures, was 6.7-fold, an effect similar in magnitude to the 5.4-fold increase of 3H-BAP adduct formation in LTEE cells, relative to control cells ( Fig. 3B ). However, the absolute levels of adducts quantified by the two methods differed greatly. Levels of adducts determined by incorporation of 3H-BAP into DNA were approximately 10-fold higher than those determined by LC-ESI/MS/MS analysis of dG- N 2-BAP.  LTEE markedly alters global gene expression in MCF-7 cells To investigate the impact of LTEE on global gene expression, we performed microarray analyses with mRNA from LTEE cells and control cells, with and without exposure to 10 nM TCDD for the final 72 h. The RNA preparations used for the microarray studies were those used in the real time RT-PCR studies presented in Fig. 1B ; the LTEE cultures contained E2 continuously until the time of RNA isolation. Analysis of the microarray data identified a subset of 824 probe sets for which significant differences in expression among the 4 groups (control, control plus TCDD, LTEE, and LTEE plus TCDD) were indicated (ANOVA, P <0.05), and for which there was variation of ?2-fold in at least one of the pairwise comparisons among the four groups. A heat map of mRNA expression evaluated with these 824 probe sets is shown in Fig. 6A , displaying the effects of LTEE and TCDD exposure. Although exposure of control cells to TCDD caused changes in the expression of a number of transcripts, the effects of LTEE on gene expression without or with TCDD exposure were much more striking. In contrast to mRNAs elevated by LTEE, some other mRNAs showed decreases in level in response to LTEE; notable was the mRNA that encodes ABCG2, also known as the breast cancer resistance protein. While LTEE depressed the level of ABCG2 expression, TCDD highly induced ABCG2 expression in both control and LTEE MCF-7 cells, as determined by microarray ( Fig. 6B ), real-time PCR ( Fig. 6C ), and Western immunoblot ( Fig. 6D ). Gene expression data limited to the subset of 824 probe sets described above and in Fig 6A are summarized as (i) responses that were elevated or depressed ?2-fold in LTEE cells, as compared with responses in control cells ( Supplementary Table 1 ); (ii) responses that were elevated or depressed ?2-fold by exposure to TCDD (10 nM, 72 h) as compared with responses in control cultures without TCDD-exposure ( Supplementary Table 2 ); and (iii) responses that were elevated or depressed ?2-fold by TCDD exposure in LTEE cells as compared with responses in LTEE cells ( Supplementary Table 3 ). In LTEE cultures, data for 345 probe sets indicated expression increases by ?2-fold, and 156 depressions by ?2-fold, relative to the controls ( Supplemental Table I ). There were numerous indications of AhR/ER? interactive effects on gene expression: of the 345 probe sets that indicated ?2-fold elevated expression in LTEE cultures, 13 showed further enhancement of expression by TCDD exposure at least 2-fold over the expression observed with LTEE only, and 89 of these showed an anti-estrogenic effect of TCDD, defined as ?50% diminution of the enhancement of expression of genes from LTEE cells, when co-exposed to TCDD. Among the genes that were more highly expressed in LTEE cultures compared with control cultures (?2-fold), a number of human genes or their rodent orthologs have been previously reported to be regulated by estrogen: S100A7 ( Moog-Lutz et al., 1995 ), AREG ( Martinez-Lacaci et al., 1995 ), IFI27 ( Rasmussen et al., 1993 ), PDZK1 ( Ghosh et al., 2000 ), SCNN1A ( Soulez and Parker, 2001 ; Bourdeau et al., 2004 ), SERPINA5 ( Soulez and Parker, 2001 ; Bourdeau et al., 2004 ), C3 ( Middleton and Linder, 1993 ; Li et al, 2002 ), CP ( Middleton and Linder, 1993 ; Stuckey et al, 2006 ), WISP2 (Inadera et al., 2000), MGP ( Sheikh et al., 1993 ), PLAT ( Ryan et al., 1984 ), SERPINE1 ( Smith et al., 2004 ), BF ( Li et al., 2002 ), SERPINA3 ( Yamamura et al., 2004 ), ABCC3 ( Vendrell et al., 2004 ), NPY1R ( Amlal et al., 2006 ) SLPI ( Shimoya et al., 2006 ), ISG20 ( Pentecost, 1998 ), PGR ( Nardulli et al., 1988 ; Coser et al., 2003 ), GJA1 ( Petrocelli and Lye, 1993 ) PRSS23 ( Cunliffe et al.,2003 ; Coser et al., 2003 ) FRK ( Coser et al., 2003 ), CYP1B1 ( Spink et al., 2003b ; Labhart et al., 2005 ), EGR3 ( Inoue et al., 2004 ), TGFA ( Kenney et al., 1993 ), CTSD ( Cavailles et al, 1988 ), and GREB1 ( Ghosh et al., 2000 ). In LTEE cultures, there were also genes that are down-regulated in expression, relative to their transcript abundances in the control cultures. Human genes or their rodent orthologs that have been previously reported to be down-regulated in expression by E2, and that were down-regulated in our studies (?2-fold), include: GRB14 ( Kairouz et al., 2005 ); TNFRSF11B ( Rachner et al., 2008 ), CAV1 ( Zschocke et al., 2002 ). CAV2 ( Zschocke et al, 2002 ). CRY2 (Nakamura et al., 2004), CLU ( So et al., 2005 ), IL1R1 ( Santen et al., 2005 ; Coser et al., 2003 ), IGFBP5 (Inoue et al., 2002), EFEMP1 (Inoue et al., 2002), PSCA ( Coser et al., 2003 ) KCNJ8 ( Coser et al., 2003 ), and CTNND2 ( Coser et al., 2003 ). Differences in gene expression patterns among treatment groups were analyzed with the MAPPFinder tool (Dalquist et al., 2002). Only two GO terms were found in the first pairwise comparison, which was between control cells and control cells exposed to TCDD. In contrast, 60 GO terms were found in the second comparison, which evaluated RNA expression in LTEE cells and in control cells, and 75 GO terms were found in the third comparison, which evaluated RNA expression in LTEE cells and in TCDD-exposed LTEE cells. For the second and third comparisons, several similar GO terms were observed, reflecting the effects of LTEE and, in some instances, the anti-estrogenic effects of TCDD ( Spink et al., 1990 ; Safe et al., 2000 ). In general, expression of genes related to the cell cycle, including regulation of mitosis and the mitotic checkpoint, was up-regulated by LTEE, and was down-regulated by the addition of TCDD to LTEE cells. Expression of genes related to the response to reactive oxygen species and DNA polymerization was also elevated by LTEE. Expression of genes related to cellular development and morphogenesis was down-regulated by LTEE; however, expression of genes related to cellular morphogenesis was also down-regulated in LTEE cells exposed to TCDD. Expression of genes that regulate cell death, apoptosis, and immune response was up-regulated in LTEE cells, whereas the addition of TCDD to LTEE cells resulted in the down-regulation of the expression of genes involved in the negative regulation of apoptosis and the up-regulation of gene expression related to prostaglandin metabolism. GO terms that were unique to TCDD effects in LTEE cells included many cellular metabolic processes. The complete list of GO terms and analysis can be found in Supplementary Table 4 .

LTEE enhances the rate of estrogen-dependent tumor growth in SCID mice Xenograft studies using SCID mice showed differences in development of tumors, between mice inoculated with LTEE MCF-7 cells and mice inoculated with the control MCF-7 cells ( Fig. 7 ). When the animals received E2 supplementation, both the LTEE-cell and control-cell groups showed 100% tumor incidence; i.e ., all of the animals in the E2 supplementation groups developed palpable tumors in the mammary glands. Among the groups that received E2 supplementation, there was a shorter latency to attainment of 100% tumor incidence in mice inoculated with LTEE cells than in mice inoculated with control cells. However, among the groups without E2 supplementation, there was a greater incidence of palpable tumors in the control-cell mice, 15/15 (100%), than in the LTEE-cell mice, 9/15 (60%). There were also differences in the E2-induced rates of tumor growth, dependent on whether the animals were inoculated with LTEE cells or control cells. In mice inoculated with LTEE cells and that received E2 supplementation, the tumors had grown to a mean volume of 440 mm3 by day 62, which was significantly greater than the tumor volumes in mice inoculated with control cells and that received E2 supplementation ( P <0.05); these tumors grew to only a mean volume of 62 mm3 at day 63. When the experiment was extended to day 71, the mean volume was still only 137 mm3. While the majority of the animals in the LTEE-cell and the control-cell groups that did not receive E2 supplementation developed palpable tumors, these tumors failed to grow beyond 2 mm3; these results establish that tumor growth of both LTEE cells and control cells is dependent on the continued presence of E2.  LTEE enhances the rate of estrogen-dependent tumor growth in SCID mice Xenograft studies using SCID mice showed differences in development of tumors, between mice inoculated with LTEE MCF-7 cells and mice inoculated with the control MCF-7 cells ( Fig. 7 ).

Discussion The incidence of breast cancer and the progression of the disease have been linked to lifetime estrogen exposure. Even in post-menopausal women, the majority of diagnosed breast cancers are estrogen-dependent. Most current studies of estrogenic effects in breast cancer cells focus on the very early events after E2 exposure. However, it is well established that estrogen exposure can have long-term effects. For example, estrogens can cause genetic imprinting in neonates ( McLachlan et al., 2001 ), and these effects can carry over to the next generation. We suggest that pre-cancerous, nascent, and dormant tumor cells are subject to similar induction of persistent changes in gene expression elicited by long-term exposure to estrogens, and posit that these changes may affect both the initiation and promotion phases of carcinogenesis. MCF-7 cells provide a model system for the study of estrogen-responsive breast cancer and the molecular biology of estrogen action. MCF-7 cells are commonly employed for in vitro studies because no ER-positive breast epithelial cell lines, normal or immortalized, of the luminal differentiation lineage are currently available. While it is known that estrogen imprinting occurs in vivo , it is not known whether the effects of LTEE observed in our study represent a directly comparable process. The propensity of the long-term presence or absence of estrogen to alter signaling pathways and gene expression in MCF-7 cells has been known for some time ( Katzenellenbogen et al., 1987 ). Long-term estrogen deprivation of MCF-7 cells, a treatment in which estrogen is essentially eliminated from the cultures by use of charcoal-stripped serum in medium formulations, leads to estrogen hypersensitivity, changes in gene expression, and up-regulation of growth factor pathways ( Katzenellenbogen et al., 1987 ; Santen et al., 2005 ). Our studies differed from this approach in that we cultured MCF-7 cells in DC5 medium prepared with bovine calf serum, which is naturally low in estrogens. We previously observed that long-term culture of MCF-7 cells in DC5 medium resulted in a marked reduction of Ah responsiveness for induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 compared with cells maintained long-term in DF5 medium ( Spink et al., 2003b ). To clearly differentiate between E2 and serum effects, the current study was performed with DC5-based media that differed only by the inclusion or omission of physiologic concentrations of E2. The effects of LTEE were greater in magnitude than those previously observed for short-term E2 exposure on CYP1B1 expression ( Spink et al., 2003b ) and estrogen induction of 3H-BAP-DNA adduct formation ( Kang and Lee, 2005 ) in MCF-7 cells. LTEE would be expected to affect numerous pathways in addition to that of the Ah response. Zou and Matsumura (2003) also chronically exposed MCF-7 cells to E2 and found in vitro increases in anchorage-independent growth and invasiveness. Our results showing that LTEE cells had greater estrogen-stimulated tumor growth in SCID mice than did control cells are consistent with the transformation-related biochemical changes described by ( Zou and Matsumura 2003 ), and they likely reflect changes in multiple signaling pathways. Indeed, cells subjected to LTEE in our study showed profound changes in global gene expression, profound not only in the magnitudes of the changes but also in the number of genes that showed differential expression. In comparison with the lesser changes seen in previous microarray studies aimed at determining the genes that are directly activated by short-term (3 to 24 h) estrogen exposure ( Frasor et al., 2003 ; Coser et al., 2003 ; Ochsner et al., 2009 ), our data essentially reflect long-term, steady-state differences in gene expression. Recently, ( Sadler et al.2009 ) also observed very large changes in gene expression in MCF-7 cells that were chronically exposed to E2. In their study and in ours, some of the observed changes may have been secondary to the initial events elicited by estrogen exposure, but they nonetheless are potentially important in the development and advancement of breast cancer. PAHs are known mammary carcinogens in rodents, and are suspected of having the same effect in humans ( Brody et al., 2007 ). The enhancement of the AhR-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 by LTEE, leading to higher capacity for metabolic activation of PAH to ultimate carcinogens, may have important implications for cancer. Our results show higher initial levels of BAP-adduct formation in LTEE cells than in control cells; however, determination of the absolute levels was method-dependent. Much higher absolute levels of DNA adducts were observed when 3H-BAP incorporation was measured, as compared to the levels of dG- N 2-BAP adducts determined by LC-ESI/MS/MS. Similar quantitatively inconsistent results have been previously obtained by Beland et al. (2005) , who found that measurements of 3H-BAP incorporation gave much higher adduct levels than did LC-ESI/MS/MS analysis. Those authors suggest that dG- N 2-BAP adducts contribute only a small fraction of the total BAP-DNA adducts, and our results are consistent with this contention. While it is not clear what accounts for the discrepancy in adduct levels as determined by the two techniques, our results raise the possibility that pathways of metabolic activation other than the BPDE pathway are responsible for the formation of DNA adducts from BAP. Two additional pathways of PAH metabolism that could be responsible for formation of BAP-DNA adducts are (i) the aldo-keto reductase-catalyzed pathway that converts PAH dihydrodiols into DNA-adductive ortho -quinones ( Quinn et al., 2008 ; McCoull et al., 1999 ; Balu et al., 2004 ), and (ii) the one-electron oxidation of PAHs to adductive intermediates ( Chen et al., 1996 ). In both the BPDE and the ortho -quinone pathways of BAP metabolic activation, the initial oxidation is catalyzed by CYP1-family enzymes. The potent inhibition of the incorporation of 3H-BAP incorporation into DNA by ANF is evidence of the involvement of CYP1 enzymes in the metabolic pathway(s) that led to adduct formation. Furthermore, the marked enhancement, by LTEE, of the initial levels of both 3H-BAP incorporation into DNA and the formation of dG- N 2-BAP adducts is consistent with the involvement of CYP1 enzymes, since, by both measures, BAP-DNA adduct formation was elevated to roughly the same magnitude as were the increases of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs, proteins, and enzyme activities in LTEE cells A notable finding in this study is that changes induced by LTEE persisted after the removal of E2. AhR-regulated CYP1A1- and CYP1B1-promoter activities, CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNAs levels, EROD activities, and BAP-DNA adduct levels were all elevated in LTEE cells that were subcultured in DC5 medium without E2 supplementation, and inclusion of the antiestrogen, ICI 182,780, did not block effects of LTEE on CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 transcriptional activation. These results suggest that persistent changes in gene expression accompany LTEE of MCF-7 cells. Through enhancement of the Ah response, E2 could play a role in the propensity of tumors to continually develop the spectrum of mutations that is observed in breast cancer ( Sjöblom et al., 2006 ; Wood et al., 2007) via the metabolic activation of carcinogens. If this is so, E2 may participate in the initiation of breast cancer, as well as in the promotion and progression phases of the disease. However, it remains to be determined whether normal ER-positive luminal cells and nascent cancer cells within the human breast respond similarly to LTEE as do MCF-7 tumor cells. The studies reported here indicate that LTEE causes adaptive responses in MCF-7 cells, possibly reflecting processes that contribute to the overall carcinogenic effect of E2.

If this is so, E2 may participate in the initiation of breast cancer, as well as in the promotion and progression phases of the disease. However, it remains to be determined whether normal ER-positive luminal cells and nascent cancer cells within the human breast respond similarly to LTEE as do MCF-7 tumor cells. The studies reported here indicate that LTEE causes adaptive responses in MCF-7 cells, possibly reflecting processes that contribute to the overall carcinogenic effect of E2.
