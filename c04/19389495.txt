Front-Line Treatment in Younger Patients With Multiple Myeloma The treatment of newly diagnosed myeloma has evolved rapidly. The choice of initial therapy depends on eligibility for stem cell transplantation, as well as baseline risk factors. Eligibility for transplantation is important since the choice of initial therapy is primarily melphalan-based in patients who are not candidates for transplant, while melphalan-containing regimens are avoided as induction therapy in transplant candidates. An assessment of risk based on independent prognostic markers is important mainly for prognosis but may have some value in choice of initial therapy. For example, bortezomib-based regimens may have particular value in patients with certain high-risk features. This review discusses the current status of front-line therapy in younger patients with myeloma who are candidates for stem cell transplantation.  CONCLUSION Novel therapies have made a substantial contribution to survival in myeloma. Thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib have been incorporated in the treatment of newly diagnosed myeloma in two- and three-drug combinations, resulting in high response rates and improvement in long-term outcomes. At present, novel agents are used to complement other standard approaches such as autologous stem cell transplantation. Future trials will define the optimal induction regimen for patient with myeloma, as well as clarify the role of transplantation in an era of novel therapy.
