Development of real-time in vivo imaging of Staphylococcus epidermidis device-related infection in mice: influence of animal immune status SUMMARY We constructed a bioluminescent strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis and developed a catheter-related murine infection model for real-time monitoring of biofilm-associated infection in this leading nosocomial pathogen. Additionally, we compared immune-compromised versus immune-competent mice, demonstrating a substantial effect of animal immune status on susceptibility to experimental S. epidermidis infection.
