Diagnosis and management of the primary headache disorders in the emergency department setting Headache continues to be a frequent cause of emergency department (ED) use, accounting for 2% of all visits. The majority of these headaches prove to be benign but painful exacerbations of chronic headache disorders, such as migraine, tension-type, and cluster. The goal of ED management is to provide rapid and quick relief of benign headache, without causing undue side effects, as well as recognizing headaches with malignant course. Though these headaches have distinct epidemiologies and clinical phenotypes, there is overlapping response to therapy: non-steroidals, triptans, dihydroergotamine, and the anti-emetic dopamine-antagonists may play a therapeutic role for each of these acute headaches.
