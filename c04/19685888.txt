Calcitriol derivatives with two different side chains at C-20. V. Potent Inhibitors of Mammary Carcinogenesis and Inducers of Leukemia Differentiation Calcitriol is implicated in many cellular functions including cellular growth and differentiation thus explaining its anti-tumor effects. It was shown that gemini, the calcitriol derivative containing two side chain at C20, is also active in gene transcription with enhanced anti-tumor activity. We have now further optimized both the A-ring and the two side chains. The chemical structures of the resulting 18 geminis were correlated with biological activities. Those containing the 1?-fluoro A-ring are the least active. Those featuring 23-yne and 23( E ) side-chains are generally more active in human breast cancer-cell growth inhibition and human leukemia-cell differentiation induction than their 23( Z ) counterparts. Based on these evaluations we selected as lead compound a 20( R ) gemini, related to calcitriol in terms of it’s A-ring, where one side chain was modified by introduction of a 23-yne function and replacement of the geminal methyl groups with trifluoromethyl groups, the other created by extension of C21 with a 3-hydroxy-3-trideuteromethyl-4,4,4-trideutero-butyl moiety.  Introduction Gemini is the cumulative term for vitamin D analogs with two side chains emanating at C-20. In the first generation of this compound category, both side chains were identical as in 1a . The arrangement comprises the unaltered chain of 1?,25(OH)2D3 ( 1 ) and a duplicate thereof as an extension of the methyl group 21. 1 From a historical viewpoint it was argued that 20-epi- 1 exhibited transcriptional activities that were some 200-5000 times higher than the ‘natural’ counterpart; 2 , 3 , 4 therefore, a biologically active derivative featuring two side chains was a tenable proposition. The presence of two side chains in one molecule raised the prospect of enhanced gene transactivation but, on the other hand, it dimmed the ability for such a compound to function as a ligand as it might overwhelm the space allotment provided by the VDR with concomitant loss of receptor affinity. 5 Even if binding would occur, there was no guarantee for induction of the specific conformational change in the receptor essential for transcriptional activity. A number of important discoveries were made in subsequent studies. Most significantly, gene transcription of gemini was demonstrated 1 , 6 and the ligand binding pocket was shown to be sufficiently malleable to allow the ligand to determine the conformation of the LBD suitable for its accommodation. 7 The ligand-dependent conformation of the LBD was investigated and access to a channel that can accommodate the second side chain of gemini was discovered. 7 , 8 Molecular dynamics simulations, likewise, confirmed that the additional side chain, tantamount to a 25% increase in volume, could be domiciliated by minor reorganizations of some 30 amino acids and major realignments of several others, without disturbing the overall structure of the LBD. 9 , 10 In this arrangement, one of the gemini side chains assumes the same position as the one of the natural ligand 1 , while the other has actually two spatial opportunities for residence. 11 It is further perceived that two distinct receptors, the nuclear VDR and the membrane VDR, recognize different shapes of the conformationally flexible 1 to elicit gene transcriptions and rapid signal transduction pathways, respectively. 12 If the LBD is, to a certain extent, indiscriminate toward ligands of variegated chemical make-up, the prospect of designing specifically targeted ligands exists 7 and, with the resulting conformational changes, targeted biochemical responses can be envisioned. Further to the classical role of 1?,25(OH)2D3, a multitude of previously unexpected physiological and biochemical activities have come to light. Most prominent are the anti-tumor effects based on antiproliferation, prodifferentiation and reduced angiogenesis. In view of the apparent VDR’s promiscuity toward ligands, we incorporated into the gemini side-chains those features that were previously established for the ‘one-side-chain’ analogs as enhancements of biological activities. These augmentations are, at least in part, due to the prevention, or retardation, of biological degradation, most notably the degradative cascade initiated by 24-hydroxylation, and include replacement of the geminal methyl groups with trifluoromethyl entities and introduction of C23-unsaturation. This 24-hydroxylation, occurring preferentially at the pro-R side chain of 1a , 13 entails higher drug dosages to increase blood calcium levels and to suppress INF-? release in MLR. 14 , 15 Thus, the resulting new generation gemini maintain the side chain of 1 but feature a different second chain. In view of the physiological precariousness of vitamin D analogs, including gemini, we argued that a gemini’s half-live could be extended by replacing the geminal methyl groups at the calcitriol side chain with trideuteromethyl moieties. 16 Such a modification was expected to alter, neither the propensity of this arm to assume the customary position within the VDR, nor the kinetically controlled binding affinity, but contemporaneously, to prolong the intra-cellular life span due to increased lipophilicity and bond strengths.. This lemma, together with the assurance of side-chain similarity to the natural hormone, led to the expectation that gemini with deuterated methyl groups to be superior drugs in an in vivo environment. Fortunately, this proposition was subsequently substantiated 1 , 17 - 20 and is corroborated in the present study comprising 18 derivatives of 1a as shown in Scheme 1 .  Experimental Section 1H-, 13C-, and 19F-NMR spectra were recorded at on a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer. The relatively long relaxation times of 13C at the trideuteromethyl positions and the multiplicity due to their spin coupling to deuterium renders these 13C resonances difficult to observe. Mass spectra were recorded on Waters ZQ (low resolution) and Brucker APEX II spectrometers (high resolution). Crystallographic data were obtained on a Brucker-Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer. TLC was performed on silica gel GF254 plates (Merck), flash chromatography employed 40-65 ? silica gel and for preparative column chromatography 15-20 ? silica gel was used. The trimethylsilyl groups at the gem-trifluoromethyl carbinol position in the ketones 12 , 14 , and 16 are unstable and cause small losses of the TMS groups during purification. Further losses of the TMS groups occur during the quench of the coupling reactions with the A-rings, and after extractive and chromatographic work-up these losses are almost complete so that the TBAF treatments commence with partially deprotected products. Progress of deprotection of the final condensation products was monitored by TLC using 1:19 and 1:9 EtOAc - hexane; 1:1 EtOAc - hexane and EtOAc were the mobile phases for the detection of the final materials. Detection was by UV light and/or phosphomolybdic acid spray. Preparative HPLC was performed on a 2×18” 15-20 ? silica YMC column using a flow rate of 100 mL/min and RI-detection. All final materials were of at least 95% purity; the major contaminants of non-crystalline materials were limited to solvent traces.

An ene -reaction with paraformaldehyde and dimethylaluminum chloride in DCM gave the pair of diols 7 E and 7 Z . Although this pair of epimers was readily separated by flash chromatography, it was hydrogenated as a mixture to furnish 8S and 8R , again easily separable by preparative HPLC. These two intermediates are the starting points for the entire cascade of the ‘S’ and ‘R’ series of the CD-ring systems. Subsequent TEMPO/chloramine-T mediated oxidations led to the aldehydes 9 , which were homologated to the alkynes 10 . 22 Conversion of the tertiary hydroxyl group to the TMS ether, prior to deprotonation with butyllithium and condensation with hexafluoracetone, gave higher yields of the diols 11S-a and 11R-a when compared to the use of the unprotected counterparts. Deprotection with fluorosilicic acid 23 furnished the triols 11S-b and 11R-b . The stereochemical assignments of the epimeric alcohols 8a and 8b , obtained after chromatographic separation ( Scheme 2 ), was confirmed by a crystallographic analysis of 11S-b whose ORTEP rendition is depicted in Figure 1 . Subsequent oxidation with PDC in DCM gave 12S-a and 12R-a and a following silylation of the tertiary hydroxyl groups led to the ketones 12S-b and 12R-b , respectively. The trimethylsilyloxy groups at the gem-trifluoromethyl positions, however, are of limited stability and partially lost upon purification of the reaction mixtures. The intermediate triols 11S-b and 11R-b served as starting materials for the preparation of the alkene series of CD-ring synthones as shown in Scheme 3 . Reduction with sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride led to the ( E )-alkene-triols 13S and 13R , whereas catalytic hydrogenation with Lindlar catalyst furnished the ( Z )-alkene-triols 15S and 15R . The members of both pairs were oxidized with PDC to the ketones, and then further protected by silylation to lead to the ( E )-alkene-ketones 14S-b and 14R-b and the ( Z )-alkene-ketones 16S-b and 16-b, respectively. The previous sequence, comprising oxidation at C8 and silylation of the tertiary hydroxyl groups, converted the triol pairs 13 and 15 to the protected ketone pairs 14S-b / 14R-b and 16S-b / 16R-b which served as suitable coupling partners with the A-ring synthones. The second phase of the synthesis included the coupling reactions of the CD-ring moieties with three different A-ring synthones as depicted in Scheme 4 . The three A-rings, in the form of the allyldiphenylphosphane oxides 17 , 24 - 26 18 , 27 - 29 and 19 30 - 32 were used in Wittig-Horner reactions with the six CD-ring units 12S-b, 14S-b, 16S-b and their ( R )-counterparts which, after deprotection with TBAF, afforded 18 combinations as final products ranging from 2S-1 to 4R-3 ( Scheme 4 ). The crystal structure of one of them ( 2R-2 ) is shown in Figure 2 . While the crystal structure of 11S-b ( Figure 1 ) corroborated the configurational assignments in the 20-S series, the structure of 2R-2 authenticates the stereochemical veracity of the 20( R ) series. Biological Studies It became apparent that the side-chain modification, the resulting configurational duality at C20 and the nature of the A-ring exert different biological responses. In a recent study with non-deuterated gemini, the analog of 2S-1 was preferred and suggested gemini to modulate the expression and activity of proteins associated in cancer-cell proliferation by inhibition of the Akt-mTOR pathway. 33 The effect, generated by introduction of deuterium, was underscored when 2S-2 was compared with the analogous, non-deuterated, epimeric pair 2S-2 and 2R-2 in the mouse MC-26 colon cancer model. 19 While the non-deuterated analog of 2R-2 exerted little effect, the epimeric non-deuterated analog of 2S-2 caused a significant reduction of colon tumor growth and tumor weight when administered at equal concentrations. The replacement of the hydrogen atom at the geminal methyl groups with deuterium, as in 2S-2 , enhanced the antitumor effect ten-fold. This remarkable C20 epimeric effect was also observed in the alteration of VDR-dependent monocytic differentiation in human leukemia cells, 34 and in the present study of MCF10CA1a cell proliferation, but, surprisingly, it was largely unpronounced in the gemini series containing the 23-yne side chain. Different anti-tumor activities among epimers are somewhat remarkable as it is generally contended that they assert their antiproliferative activity as ligands inside the LBD of the VDR. If a certain epimer of a given pair is established as a superior ligand capable to engender an antitumor effect, one would expect this bias to persevere in all antitumor responses. In view of the huge difference in antiproliferative effects between 1 and epi- 1 , as a result of disparate LBD conformations, different antineoplastic responses of two C20-epimeric geminis are not surprising. The observation that the partners of such an epimeric pair actually function differently, much like tailor-made entities for very specific antiproliferative activities, is unexpected and warrants further exploration. We now report the effects of gemini on cell proliferation of MCF10CA1a human breast cancer cells and on differentiation of NB4 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. The current study centers on the gemini pairs 2 , 3 and 4 , formal derivatives of 1 ( 2 S, 3 S and 4 S, left column in Scheme 1 ) and 20-epi- 1 ( 2 R, 3 R and 4 R, right column in Scheme 1 ), respectively. They feature the two traditional six-carbon chains of gemini ( 1a ); the significant differences in a comparison to 1a , however, are manifold, i.e., the inequality of the two chains, the replacement of the geminal methyl groups of calcitriol’s “natural chain’ by deuteromethyl moieties and the transmutation of the other to incorporate geminal trifluoromethyl groups, and 23-yne, 23( E ) and 23( Z )-ene unsaturations. To continue the theme of pharmacophoric periodicity, we also commuted the “natural” 1-hydroxy A-ring part to 19-nor and 1?-fluoro analogs. In the designations used, the first letter refers to the unsaturation of the side chain, e.g., 2 for 23-yne, 3 for 23( E )-ene and 4 for 23( Z )-ene. The symbols R and S refer to the absolute configuration at C20 and the extensions -1, -2, -3 refer to the A-ring characteristics, i.e., 1-hydroxy or “normal”, 19-nor, and 1?-fluoro arrangements, respectively. As per example, 2S-2 has an alkyne side chain, the configuration at C20 is ( S ), and the A-ring portion is of the 19-nor type. Gemini-type compounds were shown to be more active in inhibiting cell proliferation of breast-cancer cells than 1, 35 , 36 and in BMP/Smad-specific signaling in human breast epithelial cells. 37 In preclinical animal studies 2S-2 and 2R-2 prevented estrogen receptor (ER)-positive mammary tumorigenesis induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea in rats. 36 , 15 In addition, 2R-2 exhibited significant tumor-growth suppression in the ER-negative MCF10DCIS.com xenograft model without hypercalcemic toxicity. 38 A mode of action study suggested the inhibitory effect of 2R-2 to be associated with an increase of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and the insulin-like growth-factor binding-protein 3 in both animal models. Spina et al also reported that 2S-2 significantly reduced tumor growth of mouse colorectal cancer cells in BALB/c mice 9 and inhibited the invasive spread of the tumor into the surrounding muscle. 17 We first studied the inhibitory effect of gemini on MCF10CA1a cell proliferation. The biological activities in cell growth inhibition are compared in terms of IC50 values and illustrated in Table 1 . Most gemini are superior inhibitors of cell growth when compared to 1 , the naturally occurring 1?,25(OH)2D3, and significant differences ensue as a result of changes in A-rings, C20 configuration, and side-chain unsaturation. Those containing the 1?-fluoro A-rings (rows 4, 7, and 10) exerted relatively weak activities; in general, gemini featuring an alkyne side-chain (rows 2-4) or the 23( E ) function (rows 5-7), inhibited MCF10CA1a cell proliferation most effectively. In view of the well-known ability of vitamin D as an inducer of cell differentiation, we investigated the gemini’s potential as differentiation inducers in NB4 human leukemia cells by measuring the induction of monocyte cell-surface markers CD11b and CD14. In general, gemini induced NB4 cell-differentiation stronger than 1 . Conforming to the trend observed in growth inhibition of breast cancer cells, the 1?-fluoro analogs were less active in inducing cell-differentiation markers. Those containing the 1-hydroxy A-rings and the 19-nor A-rings exerted similar effects. The 23( Z )-ene side chains were generally less active than those with the 23-yne and 23( E )-ene chains, as illustrated in Figure 5 . While the C20 epimeric effect was not perceivable among members containing the 23-yne or 23( E )-ene side-chain, the differentiation was markedly enhanced in the 20R-series of those containing the 23( Z )-ene chain ( 4R-1 , 4R-2 , 4R-3 versus their S-counterparts). Conclusion In summary, we have synthesized 18 closely related gemini. The structural features incorporated into these molecules comprise established lead optimizations including side-chain unsaturations, geminal trifluoromethyl and trideuteromethyl functions, A-ring variations and duality due to C20 diastereotopicity. The resulting plexus affords an insight into the diverse structural requirements for specific biological activities. Compounds related to 1-fluoro-1-desoxy-calcitriol were less active than those containing the A-ring of calcitriol or 19-nor-calcitriol based on all parameters evaluated. As judged on the basis of IC50 values in MCF10CA1a human breast cancer cells, compound containing the 23-yne and 23( E )-ene side-chains were more potent than those featuring the Z -alkene chains. Members of the 23-yne category showed little differences between the C20 epimers; members of the 23( E )-ene category, however, were generally more active in the 20S-series while those in the 23( Z )-ene category were more active in the 20R-series. This preference of the 20S configuration in the 23( E )-ene category is reflected in the extraordinary activity of 3S-2 where the E -alkene chain gives rise to a compound that surpasses the alkyne counterpart. The activity profile associated with the nature of the A-rings was generally upheld in the study of induction potentials of monocyte cell-surface markers CD11b and CD14. The C20 epimeric effect was only discernible among members containing the 23( Z ) side chain where the 20 ( R ) epimers were profoundly more active. Most significantly; however, the 20S epimers were more active than the 20R counterparts in the colon cancer models while the C20 epimeric effect among members containing the 23-yne side chain was unpronounced in the present study of MCF10CA1a cell proliferation. Guided by the notion that this C20 epimeric effect was minimally expressed in gemini containing the 23-yne side chain, we focused our attention on a member of that category with the hope to select a compound with a broader spectrum of anticancer activities. Experimental Section 1H-, 13C-, and 19F-NMR spectra were recorded at on a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer. The relatively long relaxation times of 13C at the trideuteromethyl positions and the multiplicity due to their spin coupling to deuterium renders these 13C resonances difficult to observe. Mass spectra were recorded on Waters ZQ (low resolution) and Brucker APEX II spectrometers (high resolution). Crystallographic data were obtained on a Brucker-Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer. TLC was performed on silica gel GF254 plates (Merck), flash chromatography employed 40-65 ? silica gel and for preparative column chromatography 15-20 ? silica gel was used. The trimethylsilyl groups at the gem-trifluoromethyl carbinol position in the ketones 12 , 14 , and 16 are unstable and cause small losses of the TMS groups during purification. Further losses of the TMS groups occur during the quench of the coupling reactions with the A-rings, and after extractive and chromatographic work-up these losses are almost complete so that the TBAF treatments commence with partially deprotected products. Progress of deprotection of the final condensation products was monitored by TLC using 1:19 and 1:9 EtOAc - hexane; 1:1 EtOAc - hexane and EtOAc were the mobile phases for the detection of the final materials. Detection was by UV light and/or phosphomolybdic acid spray. Preparative HPLC was performed on a 2×18” 15-20 ? silica YMC column using a flow rate of 100 mL/min and RI-detection. All final materials were of at least 95% purity; the major contaminants of non-crystalline materials were limited to solvent traces.

Cell Culture The MCF10CA1a human breast epithelial cell line was developed and provided by Dr. Fred Miller’s group at the Karmanos Cancer Institute (Detroit, MI). The cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 5 % horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% HEPES solution at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cells were passaged every 3-4 days. Human promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells (Dr. Ethan Dmitrovsky, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH) were grown in suspension culture at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with 10% heat-activated, defined iron-supplemented bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). The NB4 cells were passaged two to three times a week to maintain log-phase growth. Determination of cell proliferation by [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine Uptake Assay The MCF10CA1a human breast epithelial cells (10,000 cells/well in a 24-well plate) were incubated with compounds in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% HEPES solution for 3 days. One ?Ci of [3H]thymidine was added to each well 3 h before the harvest. The cells were washed with PBS and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min. The cells were solubilized with the NaOH solution containing the salmon sperm DNA and the radioactivity of [3H] thymidine incorporated to the cells was analyzed with a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Determination of Differentiation Markers The NB4 cells were incubated with test compounds at 1 nM concentrations for 48 h. Aliquots of 1 × 106 cells were washed twice with PBS, and then incubated with 0.5 ?l MY4-RD1 and 0.5 ?l Mo1-FITC (Coulter, Miami, FL) to analyze the expression of differentiated cell surface markers CD14 and CD11b. The cells were suspended in 0.5 mL of PBS and analyzed with an Epics Profile II instrument (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL).  Chemical Syntheses The first part of the syntheses, illustrated in Schemes 2 and 3 is concerned with the preparation of the so-called CD-ring synthones and commences with the previously described methyl ester 5 21 which was treated with trideuteromethyl magnesium bromide in ether to afford alcohol 6 . An ene -reaction with paraformaldehyde and dimethylaluminum chloride in DCM gave the pair of diols 7 E and 7 Z . Although this pair of epimers was readily separated by flash chromatography, it was hydrogenated as a mixture to furnish 8S and 8R , again easily separable by preparative HPLC. These two intermediates are the starting points for the entire cascade of the ‘S’ and ‘R’ series of the CD-ring systems. Subsequent TEMPO/chloramine-T mediated oxidations led to the aldehydes 9 , which were homologated to the alkynes 10 . 22 Conversion of the tertiary hydroxyl group to the TMS ether, prior to deprotonation with butyllithium and condensation with hexafluoracetone, gave higher yields of the diols 11S-a and 11R-a when compared to the use of the unprotected counterparts. Deprotection with fluorosilicic acid 23 furnished the triols 11S-b and 11R-b . The stereochemical assignments of the epimeric alcohols 8a and 8b , obtained after chromatographic separation ( Scheme 2 ), was confirmed by a crystallographic analysis of 11S-b whose ORTEP rendition is depicted in Figure 1 . Subsequent oxidation with PDC in DCM gave 12S-a and 12R-a and a following silylation of the tertiary hydroxyl groups led to the ketones 12S-b and 12R-b , respectively. The trimethylsilyloxy groups at the gem-trifluoromethyl positions, however, are of limited stability and partially lost upon purification of the reaction mixtures. The intermediate triols 11S-b and 11R-b served as starting materials for the preparation of the alkene series of CD-ring synthones as shown in Scheme 3 . Reduction with sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride led to the ( E )-alkene-triols 13S and 13R , whereas catalytic hydrogenation with Lindlar catalyst furnished the ( Z )-alkene-triols 15S and 15R . The members of both pairs were oxidized with PDC to the ketones, and then further protected by silylation to lead to the ( E )-alkene-ketones 14S-b and 14R-b and the ( Z )-alkene-ketones 16S-b and 16-b, respectively. The previous sequence, comprising oxidation at C8 and silylation of the tertiary hydroxyl groups, converted the triol pairs 13 and 15 to the protected ketone pairs 14S-b / 14R-b and 16S-b / 16R-b which served as suitable coupling partners with the A-ring synthones. The second phase of the synthesis included the coupling reactions of the CD-ring moieties with three different A-ring synthones as depicted in Scheme 4 . The three A-rings, in the form of the allyldiphenylphosphane oxides 17 , 24 - 26 18 , 27 - 29 and 19 30 - 32 were used in Wittig-Horner reactions with the six CD-ring units 12S-b, 14S-b, 16S-b and their ( R )-counterparts which, after deprotection with TBAF, afforded 18 combinations as final products ranging from 2S-1 to 4R-3 ( Scheme 4 ). The crystal structure of one of them ( 2R-2 ) is shown in Figure 2 . While the crystal structure of 11S-b ( Figure 1 ) corroborated the configurational assignments in the 20-S series, the structure of 2R-2 authenticates the stereochemical veracity of the 20( R ) series.  Biological Studies It became apparent that the side-chain modification, the resulting configurational duality at C20 and the nature of the A-ring exert different biological responses. In a recent study with non-deuterated gemini, the analog of 2S-1 was preferred and suggested gemini to modulate the expression and activity of proteins associated in cancer-cell proliferation by inhibition of the Akt-mTOR pathway. 33 The effect, generated by introduction of deuterium, was underscored when 2S-2 was compared with the analogous, non-deuterated, epimeric pair 2S-2 and 2R-2 in the mouse MC-26 colon cancer model. 19 While the non-deuterated analog of 2R-2 exerted little effect, the epimeric non-deuterated analog of 2S-2 caused a significant reduction of colon tumor growth and tumor weight when administered at equal concentrations. The replacement of the hydrogen atom at the geminal methyl groups with deuterium, as in 2S-2 , enhanced the antitumor effect ten-fold. This remarkable C20 epimeric effect was also observed in the alteration of VDR-dependent monocytic differentiation in human leukemia cells, 34 and in the present study of MCF10CA1a cell proliferation, but, surprisingly, it was largely unpronounced in the gemini series containing the 23-yne side chain. Different anti-tumor activities among epimers are somewhat remarkable as it is generally contended that they assert their antiproliferative activity as ligands inside the LBD of the VDR. If a certain epimer of a given pair is established as a superior ligand capable to engender an antitumor effect, one would expect this bias to persevere in all antitumor responses. In view of the huge difference in antiproliferative effects between 1 and epi- 1 , as a result of disparate LBD conformations, different antineoplastic responses of two C20-epimeric geminis are not surprising. The observation that the partners of such an epimeric pair actually function differently, much like tailor-made entities for very specific antiproliferative activities, is unexpected and warrants further exploration. We now report the effects of gemini on cell proliferation of MCF10CA1a human breast cancer cells and on differentiation of NB4 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. The current study centers on the gemini pairs 2 , 3 and 4 , formal derivatives of 1 ( 2 S, 3 S and 4 S, left column in Scheme 1 ) and 20-epi- 1 ( 2 R, 3 R and 4 R, right column in Scheme 1 ), respectively. They feature the two traditional six-carbon chains of gemini ( 1a ); the significant differences in a comparison to 1a , however, are manifold, i.e., the inequality of the two chains, the replacement of the geminal methyl groups of calcitriol’s “natural chain’ by deuteromethyl moieties and the transmutation of the other to incorporate geminal trifluoromethyl groups, and 23-yne, 23( E ) and 23( Z )-ene unsaturations. To continue the theme of pharmacophoric periodicity, we also commuted the “natural” 1-hydroxy A-ring part to 19-nor and 1?-fluoro analogs. In the designations used, the first letter refers to the unsaturation of the side chain, e.g., 2 for 23-yne, 3 for 23( E )-ene and 4 for 23( Z )-ene. The symbols R and S refer to the absolute configuration at C20 and the extensions -1, -2, -3 refer to the A-ring characteristics, i.e., 1-hydroxy or “normal”, 19-nor, and 1?-fluoro arrangements, respectively. As per example, 2S-2 has an alkyne side chain, the configuration at C20 is ( S ), and the A-ring portion is of the 19-nor type. Gemini-type compounds were shown to be more active in inhibiting cell proliferation of breast-cancer cells than 1, 35 , 36 and in BMP/Smad-specific signaling in human breast epithelial cells. 37 In preclinical animal studies 2S-2 and 2R-2 prevented estrogen receptor (ER)-positive mammary tumorigenesis induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea in rats. 36 , 15 In addition, 2R-2 exhibited significant tumor-growth suppression in the ER-negative MCF10DCIS.com xenograft model without hypercalcemic toxicity. 38 A mode of action study suggested the inhibitory effect of 2R-2 to be associated with an increase of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and the insulin-like growth-factor binding-protein 3 in both animal models. Spina et al also reported that 2S-2 significantly reduced tumor growth of mouse colorectal cancer cells in BALB/c mice 9 and inhibited the invasive spread of the tumor into the surrounding muscle. 17 We first studied the inhibitory effect of gemini on MCF10CA1a cell proliferation. The biological activities in cell growth inhibition are compared in terms of IC50 values and illustrated in Table 1 . Most gemini are superior inhibitors of cell growth when compared to 1 , the naturally occurring 1?,25(OH)2D3, and significant differences ensue as a result of changes in A-rings, C20 configuration, and side-chain unsaturation. Those containing the 1?-fluoro A-rings (rows 4, 7, and 10) exerted relatively weak activities; in general, gemini featuring an alkyne side-chain (rows 2-4) or the 23( E ) function (rows 5-7), inhibited MCF10CA1a cell proliferation most effectively. In view of the well-known ability of vitamin D as an inducer of cell differentiation, we investigated the gemini’s potential as differentiation inducers in NB4 human leukemia cells by measuring the induction of monocyte cell-surface markers CD11b and CD14. In general, gemini induced NB4 cell-differentiation stronger than 1 . Conforming to the trend observed in growth inhibition of breast cancer cells, the 1?-fluoro analogs were less active in inducing cell-differentiation markers. Those containing the 1-hydroxy A-rings and the 19-nor A-rings exerted similar effects. The 23( Z )-ene side chains were generally less active than those with the 23-yne and 23( E )-ene chains, as illustrated in Figure 5 . While the C20 epimeric effect was not perceivable among members containing the 23-yne or 23( E )-ene side-chain, the differentiation was markedly enhanced in the 20R-series of those containing the 23( Z )-ene chain ( 4R-1 , 4R-2 , 4R-3 versus their S-counterparts).  Conclusion In summary, we have synthesized 18 closely related gemini. The structural features incorporated into these molecules comprise established lead optimizations including side-chain unsaturations, geminal trifluoromethyl and trideuteromethyl functions, A-ring variations and duality due to C20 diastereotopicity. The resulting plexus affords an insight into the diverse structural requirements for specific biological activities. Compounds related to 1-fluoro-1-desoxy-calcitriol were less active than those containing the A-ring of calcitriol or 19-nor-calcitriol based on all parameters evaluated. As judged on the basis of IC50 values in MCF10CA1a human breast cancer cells, compound containing the 23-yne and 23( E )-ene side-chains were more potent than those featuring the Z -alkene chains. Members of the 23-yne category showed little differences between the C20 epimers; members of the 23( E )-ene category, however, were generally more active in the 20S-series while those in the 23( Z )-ene category were more active in the 20R-series. This preference of the 20S configuration in the 23( E )-ene category is reflected in the extraordinary activity of 3S-2 where the E -alkene chain gives rise to a compound that surpasses the alkyne counterpart. The activity profile associated with the nature of the A-rings was generally upheld in the study of induction potentials of monocyte cell-surface markers CD11b and CD14. The C20 epimeric effect was only discernible among members containing the 23( Z ) side chain where the 20 ( R ) epimers were profoundly more active. Most significantly; however, the 20S epimers were more active than the 20R counterparts in the colon cancer models while the C20 epimeric effect among members containing the 23-yne side chain was unpronounced in the present study of MCF10CA1a cell proliferation. Guided by the notion that this C20 epimeric effect was minimally expressed in gemini containing the 23-yne side chain, we focused our attention on a member of that category with the hope to select a compound with a broader spectrum of anticancer activities.
