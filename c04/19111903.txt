Endothelin-1 exposure on postnatal day 7 alters expression of the endothelin B receptor and behavioral sensitivity to endothelin-1 on postnatal day 11 Endothelin (ET)-1 is a chemical mediator released by the body at sites of injury and disease and is involved in various painful states. This study examined whether ET-1 exposure in the neonatal period alters subsequent ET-1 induced nociception and expression of the ETB receptor. ET-1 or saline was administered to postnatal day 7 rats. On postnatal day 11, ET -1 or saline was administered; a first exposure to ET-1 for one group, and a second exposure to ET-1 for another group. A statistically significant increase in ET-1 induced paw flinching was observed in postnatal day 11 male rats exposed to ET-1 for the second time as compared to male rats exposed to ET-1 for the first time. In contrast, a statistically significant decrease in ET-1 induced paw flinching was observed in postnatal day 11 female rats exposed to ET-1 for the second time as compared to female rats exposed to ET-1 for the first time. Furthermore, in males a positive correlation was found between ET-1 induced paw flinching on postnatal day 7 versus 11. In contrast, in females a negative correlation was found between ET-1 induced paw flinching on postnatal day 7 versus 11. Changes in behavioral sensitivity to ET-1 were accompanied by sex-specific ET-1 induced changes in expression of the ETB receptor on postnatal day 11 in the plantar hindpaw with a statistically significant decrease and increase in ETB receptor expression in males and females, respectively. These findings suggest that ET-1 exposure in the neonatal period sex-specifically alters expression of the ETB receptor and behavioral sensitivity to ET-1 whereby males show sensitization and females show de-sensitization.
