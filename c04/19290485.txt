The dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system in diabesityâ€”a tricky problem Endocannabinoids (ECs) are small lipid mediators that play a critical role in energy metabolism. Human studies have shown that the EC tone in peripheral tissues positively correlates with increased adiposity. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of EC signaling results in weight loss in humans. However, the mechanisms that cause the dysregulation of the EC system in obesity are not well-understood. Since the clinical utility of currently available EC blockers is severely limited due to their side effects like depression and suicidal ideation that are caused by central effects, it is important to delineate the role of central and peripheral effects of EC signaling in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism.
