Calcium signaling and neurodegenerative diseases Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington’s disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), present an enormous medical, social, financial and scientific problem. Recent evidence indicates that neuronal calcium (Ca2+) signaling is abnormal in many of these disorders. Similar, but less severe, changes in neuronal Ca2+ signaling occur as a result of the normal aging process. The role of aberrant neuronal Ca2+ signaling in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders is discussed here. The potential utility of Ca2+ blockers for treatment of these disorders is also highlighted. It is reasoned that Ca2+ blockers will be most beneficial clinically when used in combination with other disease-specific therapeutic approaches.  Concluding remarks The recurrent theme of this review is that Ca2+-signaling proteins and the mitochondrial Ca2+-handling system constitute attractive targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov (see: http://clinicaltrials.gov ) with the keywords ‘calcium’ or ‘mitochondria’ revealed several ongoing or recent clinical trials for AD, PD, ALS and HD with Ca2+ blockers and mitochondrial stabilizers and energizers ( Table 2 ). Detailed information about these trials can be found at the ClinicalTrials.gov site by searching using the unique trial ID number listed in Table 2 . The targets of these drugs are shown in Figures 1 – 4 . Based on the postulated target and mechanism of action (MOA), the drugs tested in these trials can be grouped into several categories ( Box 3 ). It is apparent from this information ( Table 2 , Box 3 ) that some promising clinical leads are being tested but much more progress is needed. Future translation of the ‘Ca2+ hypothesis of neurodegeneration’ to clinical practice will require a coordinated effort from neurodegenerative disease researchers, drug developers and clinicians. Several key questions need to be resolved for these efforts to be successful ( Box 4 ). One might hope that, in the future, more potent and specific drugs targeting various components of Ca2+-signaling pathways ( Figures 1 – 4 ) will be developed and tested in neurodegeneration clinical trials – alone and in combination with more specific ‘disease-targeting’ approaches. Box 1. Neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling Ca2+ signaling connects membrane excitability and cell biological functions of neurons [ 87 ]. By acting at the interface between ‘electrical’ and ‘signaling’ worlds, Ca2+ channels have a key role in multiple aspects of neuronal function. Ca2+ signaling is essential for short- and long-term synaptic plasticity. Owing to its vital importance, neurons use multiple ways of controlling intracellular Ca2+ concentration, most often within local signaling microdomains. Several Ca2+ channels are involved in neuronal Ca2+ signaling, such as plasma membrane voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs), NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors, TRP channels and store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOC) channels. Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is supported by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3R) and ryanodine receptors (RyanR). SERCA pump in the ER, plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (PMCA) and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCE) in the plasma membrane tightly control cytosolic Ca2+ levels in a narrow range. Mitochondria have an important role in shaping cytosolic Ca2+ signals. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) is an ion channel that is involved in potent and rapid Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondria. Several Ca2+-binding proteins (CaBPs) are involved in buffering Ca2+ levels in neuronal cytosol [such as calbindin-D28 (CALB1), calretinin (CALB2) and parvalbumin (PVALB)] and in the ER lumen [such as calreticulin (CALR) and calnexin (CANX)]. Neurons are extremely sensitive to changes in intracellular Ca2+ and use a range of Ca2+-responsive elements, including proteins involved in synaptic vesicle fusion (such as synaptotagmins), Ca2+-dependent kinases and phosphatases [such as Ca2+/CaM kinases and Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CaN)], Ca2+-dependent signaling enzymes [such as Ca2+-dependent adenylate cyclases and Ca2+-dependent nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)] and Ca2+-dependent transcription factors [such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), calcineurin B-controlled nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and Ca2+-binding downstream regulatory element modulator (DREAM)]. The diversity of these Ca2+-responsive elements provides a means for Ca2+-dependent regulation of neuronal function in the time scale ranging from microseconds (as in the case of Ca2+-dependent synaptic-vesicle fusion) to seconds and minutes (as in the case of Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation), to days and years (as in the case of Ca2+-dependent changes in neuronal gene expression). These Ca2+-dependent processes lead to short- and long-term changes in neuronal excitability (by affecting ion-channel activity and expression pattern) and synaptic transmission (by modifying synaptic machinery and facilitating formation or disassembly of synaptic connections). Because of the extreme sensitivity of neurons to variation in Ca2+ signals, even relatively subtle defects and abnormalities in Ca2+ signaling machinery might lead to devastating consequences over a long time period [ 1 ]. Box 2. Neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and sporadic AD, PD or ALS Sporadic AD, PD and ALS are ‘multi-hit’ disorders that are triggered by several pathological factors acting in concert. Some of these factors are common to all three disorders, whereas some are ‘disease specific’. One of the factors common to all of these disorders is ageing. The ‘disease-specific’ factors result in specificity of neuronal populations being affected in these disorders – cortical and hippocampal neurons in AD, dopaminergic SNc neurons in PD and motor neurons in ALS. The major ‘disease-specific’ factor for AD is likely to be accumulation of amyloid aggregates; for PD, it is toxicity resulting from dopamine oxidation; for ALS, it is inflammatory damage induced by activated microglia. Because these disorders are ‘multi-hit’, only combinational therapies can be successful in treating these disorders, with both ‘disease-specific’ and ‘common’ pathways targeted. Neuronal populations that express high levels of Ca2+-binding proteins (CaBPs) are relatively spared in AD, PD and ALS, whereas neuronal populations with reduced levels of CaBP are severely affected. Reduction in levels of neuronal CaBPs is one of the consequences of the normal ageing process. Reduced ability to buffer cytosolic Ca2+ is likely to be one of the factors that make ageing neurons vulnerable in AD, PD and ALS. Activation of the calpain family of Ca2+-dependent proteases is observed in aging neurons and in sporadic AD, PD and ALS. The activation of calpains is caused by elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Activated calpains cleave a variety of substrates important for neuronal function, leading to neuronal dysfunction and death. Mitochondria are significantly impaired in neurons affected in AD, PD and ALS. Mitochondria are partially depolarized, the ability of mitochondria to sequester Ca2+ is diminished, the stoichiometry of electron transfer-chain components is abnormal and mitochondrial DNA is mutated. Similar, but less severe, changes occur in neuronal mitochondria during normal aging. The damage to mitochondria is likely to be caused by excessive Ca2+ load, which leads to the generation of large amounts of ROS and oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA. Thus, mitochondria are likely to be downstream from Ca2+ signaling in the pathogenic cascade. Nevertheless, it is expected that ‘mitochondrial stabilizers’, such as coenzyme Q10 and creatine, should have some beneficial effect in these disorders. Drugs targeting the mitochondrial-permeability transition pore (mtPTP) should also be extremely valuable as a ‘last defense’ approach separating cell dysfunction and cell death. Neuronal Ca2+ signaling is affected by ageing and appear to be one of the common factors involved in pathogenesis of sporadic AD, PD and ALS. Thus, Ca2+ signaling blockers are expected to have a beneficial effect in these disorders. NMDA receptor-antagonist memantine demonstrated some clinical efficacy in AD and the antiglutamate agent riluzole has some efficacy in ALS. Additional Ca2+ signaling blockers should be developed and tested in clinical trials for these disorders, alone and as a part of combination therapy together with ‘mitochondrial stabilizers’, mtPTP inhibitors and ‘disease-specific’ approaches. Box 3. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling: current prospects for therapeutic targeting Mitochondrial stabilizers and energizers Ketasyn, creatine, CoQ10 and MitoQ are tested in AD, PD, ALS and HD trials ( Figures 1 – 4 ). Considering the key role played by mitochondria in the pathogenesis of these disorders [ 88 ], some beneficial effects are expected in these trails. However, mitochondria are positioned late in the pathological pathway ( Figures 1 – 4 ) and benefits are thus likely to be limited. Indeed, only modest benefits have been observed so far with this class of compounds in neurodegenerative trials reported so far [ 88 ]. Dimebon Dimebon (Medivation Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA; http://www.medivation.com/ ) yielded promising results in Phase II AD clinical trails based on cognitive-outcome measures [ 86 ] ( Figure 1 ). Dimebon has been also tested in a Phase II HD clinical trial ( Figure 4 ). Dimebon is an old Russian antihistamine compound that has been claimed to exert neuroprotective effects at picomolar concentrations by a novel mitochondrial mechanism of action * . However, significant neuroprotective effects of Dimebon were only observed at 50 µM concentration in studies with HD MSN cultures [ 89 ]. Thus the cognitive effects of Dimebon observed in AD clinical trails [ 86 ] are likely to be due to the ability of this compound to inhibit ?-adrenergic, histamine and serotonin receptors with high affinity [ 89 ]. NMDAR antagonists Memantine is a non-competitive antagonist of NMDAR that is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of AD ( Figure 1 ). Memantine is in clinical trails for PD, ALS and HD ( Figures 2 – 4 ). The NR2B-specific antagonist EVT-101 (Evotec AG, Hamburg, Germany; http://www.evotec.com/ ) has been developed for AD treatment ( Figure 1 ) and a Phase II AD trial of EVT-101 is anticipated soon. The same compound should be of great interest for the treatment of HD. Riluzole The antiglutamate agent Riluzole is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of ALS ( Figure 3 ). Riluzole has been tested in Phase III HD clinical trails ( Figure 4 ) but did not show significant benefit based on motor-outcome measures [ 66 ]. Riluzole was also tested in a Phase II PD trail ( Figure 2 ). L-type VGCC antagonists ‘CNS-optimized’ L-type VGCC inhibitor MEM-1003 (Memory Pharmaceuticals, Montvale, New Jersey, USA; http://www.memorypharma.com/ ) has shown some beneficial effects in a Phase II AD clinical trial ( Figure 1 ). L-type VGCC antagonist Isradipine is being tested in a PD clinical trail ( Figure 2 ). * Bernales, S. et al. Dimebon induces neurite outgrowth and mitochondrial stabilization [abstract].
