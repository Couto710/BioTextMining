A New Class of Quinoline-Based DNA Hypomethylating Agents Reactivates Tumor Suppressor Genes by Blocking DNA Methyltransferase 1 Activity and Inducing Its Degradation Reactivation of silenced tumor suppressor genes by 5-azacytidine (Vidaza) and its congener 5-aza-2?-deoxycytidine (decitabine) has provided an alternate approach to cancer therapy. We have shown previously that these drugs selectively and rapidly induce degradation of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 by a proteasomal pathway. Because the toxicity of these compounds is largely due to their incorporation into DNA, it is critical to explore novel, nonnucleoside compounds that can effectively reactivate the silenced genes. Here, we report that a quinoline-based compound, designated SGI-1027, inhibits the activity of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B as well M. Sss I with comparable IC50 (6–13 µ mol/L) by competing with S -adenosylmethionine in the methylation reaction. Treatment of different cancer cell lines with SGI-1027 resulted in selective degradation of DNMT1 with minimal or no effects on DNMT3A and DNMT3B. At a concentration of 2.5 to 5 µmol/L (similar to that of decitabine), complete degradation of DNMT1 protein was achieved within 24 h without significantly affecting its mRNA level. MG132 blocked SGI-1027–induced depletion of DNMT1, indicating the involvement of proteasomal pathway. Prolonged treatment of RKO cells with SGI-1027 led to demethylation and reexpression of the silenced tumor suppressor genes P16 , MLH1 , and TIMP3 . Further, this compound did not exhibit significant toxicity in a rat hepatoma (H4IIE) cell line. This study provides a novel class of DNA hypomethylating agents that have the potential for use in epigenetic cancer therapy.  Introduction Methylation of DNA at C-5 of cytosine is the most striking modification of the mammalian genome ( 1 ). DNA methylation plays a key role in mammalian development and can result in X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, and silencing proviral elements and retrotransposons ( 2 ). Cancer cells exhibit global hypomethylation as well as localized hypermethylation of genes, particularly those encoding tumor suppressors ( 3 ). Hypermethylation of many cancer-causing genes occurs in the CpG islands of the promoter that leads to recruitment of corepressors, altered chromatin structure, and ultimately transcriptional silencing ( 4 ). The link between genomic methylation and the progression of cancer has been a subject of intense study. Unlike altered expression of genes due to specific mutations that can permanently turn off the genes, promoter methylation is a reversible process. The genes silenced due to methylation can therefore be reexpressed by DNA hypomethylating agents. This concept provided the impetus to search for drugs that hypomethylate the genes. The important components in mammalian methylation machinery are DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and methyl CpG-binding proteins, which recognize methyl cytosine residues and recruit transcriptional repressor complexes including histone deacetylases (HDAC). Two prominent classes of drugs used in reactivating epigenetically silenced genes include those that inhibit DNMTs and HDACs. DNMT1 is the major enzyme responsible for the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns during replication ( 5 , 6 ). Reactivation of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) by inhibiting DNMT1 has become a promising strategy for cancer therapy ( 2 ). Several DNA hypomethylating agents are currently being evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies. The commonly used DNA demethylating agents include cytidine or deoxycytidine analogues, such as 5-azacytidine (5-azaC), 5-aza-2?-deoxycytidine (5-azadC), 1-?- d -arabinofuranosyl-5-azacytosine, and dihydro-5-azacytosine ( 7 ). Currently, 5-azaC (Vidaza) and its congener 5-azadC (decitabine or Dacogen) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in myelodysplastic syndromes. There is a growing list of DNA methylation inhibitors in addition to 5-azaC and 5-azadC ( 7 , 8 ), which includes 5-fluoro-2?-deoxycytidine, zebularine, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, mitoxantrone, psammaplin A, procaine, N -acetylprocainamide, procainamide, hydralazine, and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( 9 – 11 ). Recently, a dinucleotide SGI-110 (previously called S110) containing 5-azaCdR moiety has been found to be very effective in inhibiting DNA methylation, but its stability and cytotoxicity is comparable with that of decitabine ( 12 ). This compound could be used for effective delivery and cellular uptake of nucleotide drugs, as it is resistant to cytidine deaminase. Most of the DNA hypomethylating agents reported thus far have serious drawbacks that include instability and relatively high toxicity due to their incorporation into DNA or into both DNA and RNA. Here, we used a new class of relatively stable, highly lipophilic quinoline-based (monoquaternary pyridinium analogue) small-molecule inhibitors of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. One of these compounds that does not bind to the RNA or the minor groove of DNA was able to inhibit DNMT activity, induce degradation of DNMT1, and reactivate TSGs.  Materials and Methods Synthesis of SGI-1027 SGI-1027 (previously called S-1027) is a quinoline-based compound ( Fig. 1 ) that was synthesized in a five-step reaction, resulting in an overall yield of 17%. Reaction of 4-nitroaniline and 2-amino-4-chloro-6-methylpyrimidine gave 6-methyl- N 4-(4-nitrophenyl) pyrimidine-2,4-diamine, which was reduced (Fe/C2H4O2) to the corresponding amine. This was coupled with 4-nitrobenzoyl chloride followed by reduction (Fe/HCI) to the amine. Reaction of this compound with 4-chloroquinoline yielded [ N -(4-(2-amino-6-methylpyrimidin-4-ylamino)phenyl)-4-(quinolin-4-ylamino) benzamide], designated SGI-1027, is an amorphous yellow solid with a melting point >280°C. High-performance liquid chromatography (reverse-phase C18, UV detection) showed a purity of 99.4%.

Solubility of SGI-1027 A 20 mmol/L stock solution of SGI-1027 was prepared in DMSO, which was used to prepare 0.2 mmol/L stock solutions. Both 20 and 0.2 mmol/L stocks were used to prepare dosing solutions of 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 300 µmol/L in culture medium. The final concentrations of DMSO in the 0 to 100 and 300 µmol/L dosing solutions were 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively. The solubility of SGI-1027 was determined using a light scattering technique and a Nephaloskan instrument after mixing appropriate amount of the compound with complete medium containing 10% bovine serum and 10% calf serum at 37°C. A reading that was greater than or equal to three times background was considered the limit of solubility. DNMT (CpG methyltransferase) assay DNA methylase activity was assayed by measuring the incorporation of 3H1-methyl group from S -adenosylmethionine (Ado-Met) into DNA using DE-81 ion exchange filter binding assay ( 13 ) with some modifications.

Cells were seeded into 96-well plates and after 48 h exposed to SGI-1027 at concentrations ranging from 0 to 300 µmol/L. The solubility was determined by Nephalometry techniques immediately after dosing and before harvesting the cells at 24 h. Following the exposure period, the cells or their supernatant (culture medium) were analyzed for changes in cell proliferation (propidium iodide), membrane leakage (?-GST), mitochondrial function [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and cellular ATP], oxidative stress (intracellular GSH and 8-isoprostane), and apoptosis (caspase-3; ref. 25). The half-maximal toxic concentration (TC50) was determined from the dose-response curves.

Results A new class of nonnucleoside DNA hypomethylating agents Although 5-azaC and 5-azadC have been used for nearly 25 years as DNA hypomethylating agents in experimental systems and more recently for treating some cancer patients, their relative instability and toxicity due to incorporation into DNA have limited their clinical applications. To circumvent this problem, we initiated the synthesis of a new class of quinoline-based compounds that are not incorporated into DNA and exhibit the characteristics of DNA hypomethylating agents. Quinolinium bisquaternary salts related to SGI-1027 are known to bind reversibly in the minor groove of DNA as shown by nuclear magnetic resonance ( 26 ) and X-ray crystallographic ( 27 ) studies. The bisquaternary salts were originally developed as anticancer drugs ( 28 ), with the quaternary functions critical for their activity and tight DNA binding of these compounds, but their mechanism of action was not defined. The nonquaternized, weakly basic compound SGI-1027 also binds reversibly but much less strongly to DNA [IC50 0.51 µmol/L for binding to poly(dA-dT) determined by fluorescence quenching assay] and is indefinitely stable in aqueous solution. It is highly lipophilic ( C log of 5.93; calculated by ChemBioDraw Ultra 9.0) and has a low polar surface area of 116 (calculated by ChemBioDraw Ultra 9.0) indicative of good distribution and cell uptake abilities. SGI-1027 exhibits poor solubility and excellent stability in rat and human plasma and microsomes (at 1 µmol/L). SGI-1027 inhibits DNMT activity At the outset, we tested if SGI-1027 can inhibit the activity of bacterial M. Sss I (which methylates CpG dinucleotides robustly) and mammalian DNMTs. All these enzymes have conserved P-Q-E at COOH terminus involved in catalysis ( 29 ). For this purpose, CpG methylase activity of several DNMTs was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of the inhibitor. DNMTase activity of all three enzymes was significantly inhibited by SGI-1027 ( Fig. 2 ). There was a linear decrease in M. Sss I activity with increasing concentrations of the drug ( Fig. 2 A ). IC50 value ranged from 13.5 to 16 µmol/L when Ado-Met was used at a concentration of 75 or 150 µmol/L, with poly(dI-dC) as substrate. The inhibitory effect of SGI-1027 on mammalian DNMTs was even more prominent (IC50, 6–12.5 µmol/L; Fig. 2 B ), displaying comparable inhibitory activity toward DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. Further, the activities of endogenous Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b purified from mouse lymphosarcoma cells ( 14 , 30 ) were also reduced to similar extent as the recombinant enzymes (data not shown). Notably, DNMT1 activity was also diminished to a comparable level with hemimethylated DNA ( 24 ) as the substrate ( Fig. 2 B ). As expected, decitabine did not curtail the enzyme activity even at the highest concentration used (100 µmol/L; Fig. 2 A ). To elucidate the mechanism of SGI-1027 inhibition, we measured the enzyme activity with varying concentrations of either DNA or Ado-Met (see Materials and Methods). SGI-1027 inhibited DNMTase activity by competing with Ado-Met ( Fig. 2 C ) but not with the substrate DNA. However, plots of 1/V versus 1/S indicated that V max is decreased by the inhibitor, whereas K m remained unaltered (data not shown). These data suggest that the inhibitor is of the noncompetitive type and that SGI-1027 probably competes with Ado-Met for access to the cofactor binding site of the enzyme. We next tested whether SGI-1027 could inhibit methylation of a 1,020 bp fragment of human P16 promoter (see Materials and Methods for details). Its methylation by CpG methylase resulted in its resistance to Bst U I (a methylation-sensitive enzyme; Fig. 2 D , compare lanes 3 and 2 ). However, a concentration-dependent inhibition of P16 promoter methylation was observed with SGI-1027 as shown by the increased level of the Bst U I-digested fragments with an IC50 of 16 µmol/L ( Fig. 2 D ). Here again, the methylation reaction in the presence of decitabine did not generate any Bst U I-cleaved product. These data show that SGI-1027 inhibits DNA methylation by directly inhibiting DNMTs, whereas decitabine can act as an inhibitor only after its incorporation into DNA substrates ( 31 ). SGI-1027 treatment can reactivate silenced TSGs Many TSGs are silenced in different cancer cells due to hypermethylation of CpG islands in their promoters. The TSGs P16, MLH1 , and TIMP3 are epigenetically silenced in RKO cells ( 22 , 32 , 33 ). To show that SGI-1027 indeed resulted in the reexpression of these TSGs silenced due to promoter methylation, we determined their mRNA levels in cells treated with the inhibitor for different periods. RT-PCR analysis showed reexpression of TSGs by both SGI-1027 and decitabine at comparable levels ( Fig. 3 ). The TIMP3 mRNA elevated ~14- and 9-fold on treatment with 1 µmol/L SGI-1027 and decitabine, respectively ( Fig. 3 A ). Treatment with SGI-1027 or decitabine for longer periods did not further increase TIMP3 expression (data not presented). Reactivation of P16 and MLH1 was obvious after 7 days of exposure to SGI-1027 or decitabine ( Fig. 3 B ). Interestingly, SGI-1027 was superior to decitabine with respect to its ability to reexpress both genes after 7 days of treatment ( Fig. 3 C ). P16 expression increased 2- and 3.5-fold after treatment with 1 µmol/L decitabine and SGI-1027, respectively. Treatment with 2.5 µmol/L decitabine and SGI-1027 resulted in 4- and 8-fold increase in P16 mRNA, respectively. We also determined the protein levels of TIMP3 and P16 after treatment with 1 and 2.5 µmol/L of the drugs. TIMP3 protein was significantly higher in the SGI-1027–treated cells compared with the decitabine-treated cells, which was consistent with changes in the mRNA levels ( Fig. 3 D ). Similarly, a dose-dependent increase in the P16 protein level was observed in cells in response to both drugs. Importantly, SGI-1027–treated cells exhibited 5-fold increase in the level of P16 protein compared with that with decitabine. P16 and TIMP3 CpG islands are demethylated on treatment of cancer cells with SGI-1027 To determine whether reexpression of the TSGs on prolonged treatment of colon cancer cells with SGI-1027 was due to demethylation of their CpG islands, we performed methylation-specific PCR analysis of the P16 and TIMP3 genes in RKO cells. We analyzed the region of P16 gene that was shown to be methylated in cancer cells ( 21 ). We used two different reverse primers specific for unmethylated and methylated CpG islands of exon 1 of P16 . Only methylated amplicons were obtained in untreated RKO cells ( Fig. 4 A ). Substantial amplification of unmethylated CpG island on treatment with SGI-1027 indicates demethylation of the CpG island in P16 exon 1. As expected, the methylation-specific primers could generate ampli cons after bisulfite treatment only in untreated RKO cells but not in normal colon ( Fig. 4 A ). The SGI-1027–induced demethylation of this region was comparable with that obtained with decitabine. Both drugs facilitated significant demethylation of P16 gene after treatment for 15 days. A similar protocol was used to establish demethylation of TIMP3 promoter by SGI-1027. Here again, only methylation-specific primers could generate amplicon from untreated RKO cells ( Fig. 4 B . On the other hand, significant amplification was observed with the nonmethylation-specific primers in SGI-1027–treated (5–7 days) cells that was consistent with that achieved with normal human colon sample ( Fig. 4 B ). To confirm demethylation of CpG island, we also performed COBRA of TIMP3 gene. The result showed significantly reduced (~60%) digestion of the amplicon with Taq I obtained from bisulfite-treated DNA from SGI-1027–treated cells as opposed to its complete digestion in untreated cells ( Fig. 4 C ). This result coupled with the RT-PCR data therefore proves that SGI-1027 reactivates the silenced P16 and TIMP3 genes by demethylation of their respective CpG islands. The next obvious question was whether SGI-1027 treatment of cancer cells caused genome-wide demethylation. To address this issue, we measured methyl cytosine to cytosine content of genomic DNA by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. However, methyl cytosine content was not significantly altered in RKO cells treated with the inhibitor ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). This result shows that SGI-1027 specifically demethylates the CpG islands of TSGs without global hypomethylation. Treatment with SGI-1027 results in selective degradation of DNMT1 in a wide variety of human cancer cell lines Our earlier study has shown selective degradation of DNMT1, the major DNMT, induced by decitabine (5-azadC) in human cancer cell lines ( 16 ). We were therefore curious to know whether SGI-1027, which inhibits the enzyme activity by a different mechanism, can also induce degradation of DNMT1. We measured DNMT1 levels by immunoblot analysis of extracts from the HCT116 cells treated with the drug. Treatment of the cells with 5 µmol/L SGI-1027 for 24 h resulted in ~ 95% depletion of DNMT1, which was comparable with that achieved with decitabine ( Fig. 5 A , left ). Like decitabine, SGI-1027 had either no effect or minimal effect on DNMT3A or DNMT3B protein levels. This result shows that the reversible and weakly DNA-binding quinoline-based compound selectively induces degradation DNMT1 in human colon cancer cell line, HCT116. Similar degradation of DNMT1 also occurred in another human colon cancer cell line RKO ( Fig. 5 A , right ). To investigate whether SGI-1027 is also effective in other cancer cell types of different tissue origins, the levels of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B protein were measured in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human cervical cancer (HeLa), prostate cancer (LNCaP), and breast cancer (MCF7) cell lines ( Supplementary Fig. S2 A–D ). At 2.5 and 5 µmol/L concentrations, its efficacy was comparable with that of decitabine (95-98%). At 2.5 µmol/L concentration, DNMT1 was completely degraded in MCF7 and HCC cells, whereas higher concentrations of the inhibitor were required for complete depletion of DNMT1 in cervical cancer (HeLa) and prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells ( Supplementary Fig. S2 B and C ). These results show that, depending on the cell type, the effective dose of SGI-1027 required for complete degradation of DNMT1 varies. Note that DNMT3A and 3B levels remained virtually unaltered in all cell types on exposure to SGI-1027 as observed with decitabine ( Fig. 5 A ; Supplementary S2 ). SGI-1027–induced degradation of DNMT1 is an early event that occurs via proteasomal pathway To determine whether DNMT1 degradation is initiated at an early stage of drug treatment, we performed Western blot analysis with extracts from the HCT116 cells treated with SGI-1027 for different periods. The results showed that DNMT1 depletion occurs as early as 6 h of treatment. DNMT1 level was reduced to ~ 40% at this time point and almost complete degradation (~90%) was achieved at 24 h ( Fig. 5 B ). To establish the mechanism of SGI-1027–induced degradation of DNMT1, we measured mRNA levels of all three DNMTs by real-time RT-PCR following treatment with the drug. The increase in the mRNA levels of all three after exposure of cells to 2.5 or 5 µmol/L SGI-1027 for 24 h ( Fig. 5 C ) shows that SGI-1027–mediated depletion of DNMT1 ( Fig. 5 A and B ; Supplementary Fig. S2 ) is not due to altered mRNA expression. We then tested the possibility that SGI-1027–mediated depletion of DNMT1 may also be due to rapid degradation of the preformed DNMT1 protein at the post-translational event as observed with decitabine ( 16 ). For this purpose, DNMT1 level was measured in cells treated with the potent proteasomal inhibitor MG132 before exposure to SGI-1027. Under these conditions, the SGI-1027–induced depletion of DNMT1 was significantly blocked in a concentration-dependent manner ( Fig. 5 D ). This result proves that SGI-1027 treatment induces DNMT1 degradation by a proteasomal pathway. Collectively, the data show that SGI-1027 reactivates TSGs by inducing promoter hypomethylation by inactivating all three DNMTases and causing selective degradation of DNMT1, the major maintenance DNMTase. SGI-1027 exhibits minimal or no cytotoxic effect in rat hepatoma cells To explore the advantages of SGI-1027 over 5-aza compounds as a DNA hypomethylating agent, we investigated the antioxidant and cytotoxic effects of SGI-1027 in a metabolically active rat hepatoma cell line (H4IIE). On exposure of the cells to different concentrations of SGI-1027, we analyzed cell proliferation and the level of antioxidant enzyme GST (as a measure of membrane leakage/toxicity) and mitochondrial function. Cell proliferation assay showed a linear decrease in cell number with increasing doses of SGI-1027 exposure ( Fig. 6 A ), indicating its growth-inhibitory effect in this cell line. However, SGI-1027 exerted similar growth-inhibitory effects in colon cancer cells (HCT116 and RKO; data not shown). Again, there was no change in the level of GST on exposure of the cells to SGI-1027 at any concentration tested ( Fig. 6 A ). This result further shows that SGI-1027 exerts its growth-inhibitory effect without showing any cellular membrane toxicity. The effect of SGI-1027 on the mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using rhodamine B and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Rhodamine B distributes across the biological membranes in response to the electrical transmembrane potential. However, with increasing concentrations of SGI-1027 up to 20 µmol/L, the limit of its solubility, a less pronounced decrease in transmembrane potential was noticed ( Fig. 6 A ). The corresponding linear increase in cellular ATP levels probably protects the cells from cytotoxicity induced by SGI-1027. Reduced GSH and related enzymes, such as GSTs (phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes), are important cellular defense against oxidative stress. To investigate potential induction of oxidative stress by SGI-1027, we measured the cellular GSH level after 24 h exposure of the rat hepatoma cells at different concentrations of the drug. There was a linear increase in cellular GSH level up to 20 µmol/L concentration of SGI-1027 ( Fig. 6 B ). On the other hand, there was almost no change in the level of GST ( Fig. 6 A ). A minimal increase in the level of GSH alone probably explains a very low level oxidative stress induced by SGI-1027, which can be counteracted by GSH only in the absence of its interacting detoxifying partner GST. In recent years, measurement of 8-isoprostane in cells and plasma has emerged as one of the ideal markers of oxidative stress ( 34 ). There was no change in the level of cellular 8-isoprostane level on exposure to SGI-1027 at any concentration tested ( Fig. 6 B ). These data further show that SGI-1027 does not exhibit any cytotoxic effect. We next examined the potential growth-inhibitory property of SGI-1027 by inducing apoptosis. Because caspase-3 activation plays a key role during initiation of apoptosis, we measured cellular caspase-3 levels after incubation of cells for 24 h with different concentrations of SGI-1027. There was no change in the level of caspase-3 up to 20 µmol/L concentration (the limit of solubility of SGI-1027; Fig. 6 C ). This result suggests that SGI-1027 does not have any role in induction of apoptosis.  Results A new class of nonnucleoside DNA hypomethylating agents Although 5-azaC and 5-azadC have been used for nearly 25 years as DNA hypomethylating agents in experimental systems and more recently for treating some cancer patients, their relative instability and toxicity due to incorporation into DNA have limited their clinical applications. To circumvent this problem, we initiated the synthesis of a new class of quinoline-based compounds that are not incorporated into DNA and exhibit the characteristics of DNA hypomethylating agents. Quinolinium bisquaternary salts related to SGI-1027 are known to bind reversibly in the minor groove of DNA as shown by nuclear magnetic resonance ( 26 ) and X-ray crystallographic ( 27 ) studies. The bisquaternary salts were originally developed as anticancer drugs ( 28 ), with the quaternary functions critical for their activity and tight DNA binding of these compounds, but their mechanism of action was not defined. The nonquaternized, weakly basic compound SGI-1027 also binds reversibly but much less strongly to DNA [IC50 0.51 µmol/L for binding to poly(dA-dT) determined by fluorescence quenching assay] and is indefinitely stable in aqueous solution. It is highly lipophilic ( C log of 5.93; calculated by ChemBioDraw Ultra 9.0) and has a low polar surface area of 116 (calculated by ChemBioDraw Ultra 9.0) indicative of good distribution and cell uptake abilities. SGI-1027 exhibits poor solubility and excellent stability in rat and human plasma and microsomes (at 1 µmol/L). SGI-1027 inhibits DNMT activity At the outset, we tested if SGI-1027 can inhibit the activity of bacterial M. Sss I (which methylates CpG dinucleotides robustly) and mammalian DNMTs. All these enzymes have conserved P-Q-E at COOH terminus involved in catalysis ( 29 ). For this purpose, CpG methylase activity of several DNMTs was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of the inhibitor. DNMTase activity of all three enzymes was significantly inhibited by SGI-1027 ( Fig. 2 ). There was a linear decrease in M. Sss I activity with increasing concentrations of the drug ( Fig. 2 A ). IC50 value ranged from 13.5 to 16 µmol/L when Ado-Met was used at a concentration of 75 or 150 µmol/L, with poly(dI-dC) as substrate. The inhibitory effect of SGI-1027 on mammalian DNMTs was even more prominent (IC50, 6–12.5 µmol/L; Fig. 2 B ), displaying comparable inhibitory activity toward DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. Further, the activities of endogenous Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b purified from mouse lymphosarcoma cells ( 14 , 30 ) were also reduced to similar extent as the recombinant enzymes (data not shown). Notably, DNMT1 activity was also diminished to a comparable level with hemimethylated DNA ( 24 ) as the substrate ( Fig. 2 B ). As expected, decitabine did not curtail the enzyme activity even at the highest concentration used (100 µmol/L; Fig. 2 A ). To elucidate the mechanism of SGI-1027 inhibition, we measured the enzyme activity with varying concentrations of either DNA or Ado-Met (see Materials and Methods). SGI-1027 inhibited DNMTase activity by competing with Ado-Met ( Fig. 2 C ) but not with the substrate DNA. However, plots of 1/V versus 1/S indicated that V max is decreased by the inhibitor, whereas K m remained unaltered (data not shown). These data suggest that the inhibitor is of the noncompetitive type and that SGI-1027 probably competes with Ado-Met for access to the cofactor binding site of the enzyme. We next tested whether SGI-1027 could inhibit methylation of a 1,020 bp fragment of human P16 promoter (see Materials and Methods for details). Its methylation by CpG methylase resulted in its resistance to Bst U I (a methylation-sensitive enzyme; Fig. 2 D , compare lanes 3 and 2 ). However, a concentration-dependent inhibition of P16 promoter methylation was observed with SGI-1027 as shown by the increased level of the Bst U I-digested fragments with an IC50 of 16 µmol/L ( Fig. 2 D ). Here again, the methylation reaction in the presence of decitabine did not generate any Bst U I-cleaved product. These data show that SGI-1027 inhibits DNA methylation by directly inhibiting DNMTs, whereas decitabine can act as an inhibitor only after its incorporation into DNA substrates ( 31 ). SGI-1027 treatment can reactivate silenced TSGs Many TSGs are silenced in different cancer cells due to hypermethylation of CpG islands in their promoters. The TSGs P16, MLH1 , and TIMP3 are epigenetically silenced in RKO cells ( 22 , 32 , 33 ). To show that SGI-1027 indeed resulted in the reexpression of these TSGs silenced due to promoter methylation, we determined their mRNA levels in cells treated with the inhibitor for different periods. RT-PCR analysis showed reexpression of TSGs by both SGI-1027 and decitabine at comparable levels ( Fig. 3 ). The TIMP3 mRNA elevated ~14- and 9-fold on treatment with 1 µmol/L SGI-1027 and decitabine, respectively ( Fig. 3 A ). Treatment with SGI-1027 or decitabine for longer periods did not further increase TIMP3 expression (data not presented). Reactivation of P16 and MLH1 was obvious after 7 days of exposure to SGI-1027 or decitabine ( Fig. 3 B ). Interestingly, SGI-1027 was superior to decitabine with respect to its ability to reexpress both genes after 7 days of treatment ( Fig. 3 C ). P16 expression increased 2- and 3.5-fold after treatment with 1 µmol/L decitabine and SGI-1027, respectively. Treatment with 2.5 µmol/L decitabine and SGI-1027 resulted in 4- and 8-fold increase in P16 mRNA, respectively. We also determined the protein levels of TIMP3 and P16 after treatment with 1 and 2.5 µmol/L of the drugs. TIMP3 protein was significantly higher in the SGI-1027–treated cells compared with the decitabine-treated cells, which was consistent with changes in the mRNA levels ( Fig. 3 D ). Similarly, a dose-dependent increase in the P16 protein level was observed in cells in response to both drugs. Importantly, SGI-1027–treated cells exhibited 5-fold increase in the level of P16 protein compared with that with decitabine. P16 and TIMP3 CpG islands are demethylated on treatment of cancer cells with SGI-1027 To determine whether reexpression of the TSGs on prolonged treatment of colon cancer cells with SGI-1027 was due to demethylation of their CpG islands, we performed methylation-specific PCR analysis of the P16 and TIMP3 genes in RKO cells. We analyzed the region of P16 gene that was shown to be methylated in cancer cells ( 21 ). We used two different reverse primers specific for unmethylated and methylated CpG islands of exon 1 of P16 . Only methylated amplicons were obtained in untreated RKO cells ( Fig. 4 A ). Substantial amplification of unmethylated CpG island on treatment with SGI-1027 indicates demethylation of the CpG island in P16 exon 1. As expected, the methylation-specific primers could generate ampli cons after bisulfite treatment only in untreated RKO cells but not in normal colon ( Fig. 4 A ). The SGI-1027–induced demethylation of this region was comparable with that obtained with decitabine. Both drugs facilitated significant demethylation of P16 gene after treatment for 15 days. A similar protocol was used to establish demethylation of TIMP3 promoter by SGI-1027. Here again, only methylation-specific primers could generate amplicon from untreated RKO cells ( Fig. 4 B . On the other hand, significant amplification was observed with the nonmethylation-specific primers in SGI-1027–treated (5–7 days) cells that was consistent with that achieved with normal human colon sample ( Fig. 4 B ). To confirm demethylation of CpG island, we also performed COBRA of TIMP3 gene. The result showed significantly reduced (~60%) digestion of the amplicon with Taq I obtained from bisulfite-treated DNA from SGI-1027–treated cells as opposed to its complete digestion in untreated cells ( Fig. 4 C ). This result coupled with the RT-PCR data therefore proves that SGI-1027 reactivates the silenced P16 and TIMP3 genes by demethylation of their respective CpG islands. The next obvious question was whether SGI-1027 treatment of cancer cells caused genome-wide demethylation. To address this issue, we measured methyl cytosine to cytosine content of genomic DNA by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. However, methyl cytosine content was not significantly altered in RKO cells treated with the inhibitor ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). This result shows that SGI-1027 specifically demethylates the CpG islands of TSGs without global hypomethylation. Treatment with SGI-1027 results in selective degradation of DNMT1 in a wide variety of human cancer cell lines Our earlier study has shown selective degradation of DNMT1, the major DNMT, induced by decitabine (5-azadC) in human cancer cell lines ( 16 ). We were therefore curious to know whether SGI-1027, which inhibits the enzyme activity by a different mechanism, can also induce degradation of DNMT1. We measured DNMT1 levels by immunoblot analysis of extracts from the HCT116 cells treated with the drug. Treatment of the cells with 5 µmol/L SGI-1027 for 24 h resulted in ~ 95% depletion of DNMT1, which was comparable with that achieved with decitabine ( Fig. 5 A , left ). Like decitabine, SGI-1027 had either no effect or minimal effect on DNMT3A or DNMT3B protein levels. This result shows that the reversible and weakly DNA-binding quinoline-based compound selectively induces degradation DNMT1 in human colon cancer cell line, HCT116. Similar degradation of DNMT1 also occurred in another human colon cancer cell line RKO ( Fig. 5 A , right ). To investigate whether SGI-1027 is also effective in other cancer cell types of different tissue origins, the levels of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B protein were measured in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human cervical cancer (HeLa), prostate cancer (LNCaP), and breast cancer (MCF7) cell lines ( Supplementary Fig. S2 A–D ). At 2.5 and 5 µmol/L concentrations, its efficacy was comparable with that of decitabine (95-98%). At 2.5 µmol/L concentration, DNMT1 was completely degraded in MCF7 and HCC cells, whereas higher concentrations of the inhibitor were required for complete depletion of DNMT1 in cervical cancer (HeLa) and prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells ( Supplementary Fig. S2 B and C ). These results show that, depending on the cell type, the effective dose of SGI-1027 required for complete degradation of DNMT1 varies. Note that DNMT3A and 3B levels remained virtually unaltered in all cell types on exposure to SGI-1027 as observed with decitabine ( Fig. 5 A ; Supplementary S2 ). SGI-1027–induced degradation of DNMT1 is an early event that occurs via proteasomal pathway To determine whether DNMT1 degradation is initiated at an early stage of drug treatment, we performed Western blot analysis with extracts from the HCT116 cells treated with SGI-1027 for different periods. The results showed that DNMT1 depletion occurs as early as 6 h of treatment. DNMT1 level was reduced to ~ 40% at this time point and almost complete degradation (~90%) was achieved at 24 h ( Fig. 5 B ). To establish the mechanism of SGI-1027–induced degradation of DNMT1, we measured mRNA levels of all three DNMTs by real-time RT-PCR following treatment with the drug. The increase in the mRNA levels of all three after exposure of cells to 2.5 or 5 µmol/L SGI-1027 for 24 h ( Fig. 5 C ) shows that SGI-1027–mediated depletion of DNMT1 ( Fig. 5 A and B ; Supplementary Fig. S2 ) is not due to altered mRNA expression. We then tested the possibility that SGI-1027–mediated depletion of DNMT1 may also be due to rapid degradation of the preformed DNMT1 protein at the post-translational event as observed with decitabine ( 16 ). For this purpose, DNMT1 level was measured in cells treated with the potent proteasomal inhibitor MG132 before exposure to SGI-1027. Under these conditions, the SGI-1027–induced depletion of DNMT1 was significantly blocked in a concentration-dependent manner ( Fig. 5 D ). This result proves that SGI-1027 treatment induces DNMT1 degradation by a proteasomal pathway. Collectively, the data show that SGI-1027 reactivates TSGs by inducing promoter hypomethylation by inactivating all three DNMTases and causing selective degradation of DNMT1, the major maintenance DNMTase. SGI-1027 exhibits minimal or no cytotoxic effect in rat hepatoma cells To explore the advantages of SGI-1027 over 5-aza compounds as a DNA hypomethylating agent, we investigated the antioxidant and cytotoxic effects of SGI-1027 in a metabolically active rat hepatoma cell line (H4IIE). On exposure of the cells to different concentrations of SGI-1027, we analyzed cell proliferation and the level of antioxidant enzyme GST (as a measure of membrane leakage/toxicity) and mitochondrial function. Cell proliferation assay showed a linear decrease in cell number with increasing doses of SGI-1027 exposure ( Fig. 6 A ), indicating its growth-inhibitory effect in this cell line. However, SGI-1027 exerted similar growth-inhibitory effects in colon cancer cells (HCT116 and RKO; data not shown). Again, there was no change in the level of GST on exposure of the cells to SGI-1027 at any concentration tested ( Fig. 6 A ). This result further shows that SGI-1027 exerts its growth-inhibitory effect without showing any cellular membrane toxicity. The effect of SGI-1027 on the mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using rhodamine B and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Rhodamine B distributes across the biological membranes in response to the electrical transmembrane potential. However, with increasing concentrations of SGI-1027 up to 20 µmol/L, the limit of its solubility, a less pronounced decrease in transmembrane potential was noticed ( Fig. 6 A ). The corresponding linear increase in cellular ATP levels probably protects the cells from cytotoxicity induced by SGI-1027. Reduced GSH and related enzymes, such as GSTs (phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes), are important cellular defense against oxidative stress. To investigate potential induction of oxidative stress by SGI-1027, we measured the cellular GSH level after 24 h exposure of the rat hepatoma cells at different concentrations of the drug. There was a linear increase in cellular GSH level up to 20 µmol/L concentration of SGI-1027 ( Fig. 6 B ). On the other hand, there was almost no change in the level of GST ( Fig. 6 A ). A minimal increase in the level of GSH alone probably explains a very low level oxidative stress induced by SGI-1027, which can be counteracted by GSH only in the absence of its interacting detoxifying partner GST. In recent years, measurement of 8-isoprostane in cells and plasma has emerged as one of the ideal markers of oxidative stress ( 34 ). There was no change in the level of cellular 8-isoprostane level on exposure to SGI-1027 at any concentration tested ( Fig. 6 B ). These data further show that SGI-1027 does not exhibit any cytotoxic effect. We next examined the potential growth-inhibitory property of SGI-1027 by inducing apoptosis. Because caspase-3 activation plays a key role during initiation of apoptosis, we measured cellular caspase-3 levels after incubation of cells for 24 h with different concentrations of SGI-1027. There was no change in the level of caspase-3 up to 20 µmol/L concentration (the limit of solubility of SGI-1027; Fig. 6 C ). This result suggests that SGI-1027 does not have any role in induction of apoptosis.

All these enzymes have conserved P-Q-E at COOH terminus involved in catalysis ( 29 ). For this purpose, CpG methylase activity of several DNMTs was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of the inhibitor. DNMTase activity of all three enzymes was significantly inhibited by SGI-1027 ( Fig. 2 ). There was a linear decrease in M. Sss I activity with increasing concentrations of the drug ( Fig. 2 A ). IC50 value ranged from 13.5 to 16 µmol/L when Ado-Met was used at a concentration of 75 or 150 µmol/L, with poly(dI-dC) as substrate. The inhibitory effect of SGI-1027 on mammalian DNMTs was even more prominent (IC50, 6–12.5 µmol/L; Fig. 2 B ), displaying comparable inhibitory activity toward DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. Further, the activities of endogenous Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b purified from mouse lymphosarcoma cells ( 14 , 30 ) were also reduced to similar extent as the recombinant enzymes (data not shown). Notably, DNMT1 activity was also diminished to a comparable level with hemimethylated DNA ( 24 ) as the substrate ( Fig. 2 B ). As expected, decitabine did not curtail the enzyme activity even at the highest concentration used (100 µmol/L; Fig. 2 A ). To elucidate the mechanism of SGI-1027 inhibition, we measured the enzyme activity with varying concentrations of either DNA or Ado-Met (see Materials and Methods). SGI-1027 inhibited DNMTase activity by competing with Ado-Met ( Fig. 2 C ) but not with the substrate DNA. However, plots of 1/V versus 1/S indicated that V max is decreased by the inhibitor, whereas K m remained unaltered (data not shown). These data suggest that the inhibitor is of the noncompetitive type and that SGI-1027 probably competes with Ado-Met for access to the cofactor binding site of the enzyme. We next tested whether SGI-1027 could inhibit methylation of a 1,020 bp fragment of human P16 promoter (see Materials and Methods for details). Its methylation by CpG methylase resulted in its resistance to Bst U I (a methylation-sensitive enzyme; Fig. 2 D , compare lanes 3 and 2 ). However, a concentration-dependent inhibition of P16 promoter methylation was observed with SGI-1027 as shown by the increased level of the Bst U I-digested fragments with an IC50 of 16 µmol/L ( Fig. 2 D ). Here again, the methylation reaction in the presence of decitabine did not generate any Bst U I-cleaved product. These data show that SGI-1027 inhibits DNA methylation by directly inhibiting DNMTs, whereas decitabine can act as an inhibitor only after its incorporation into DNA substrates ( 31 ).

SGI-1027 treatment can reactivate silenced TSGs Many TSGs are silenced in different cancer cells due to hypermethylation of CpG islands in their promoters. The TSGs P16, MLH1 , and TIMP3 are epigenetically silenced in RKO cells ( 22 , 32 , 33 ). To show that SGI-1027 indeed resulted in the reexpression of these TSGs silenced due to promoter methylation, we determined their mRNA levels in cells treated with the inhibitor for different periods. RT-PCR analysis showed reexpression of TSGs by both SGI-1027 and decitabine at comparable levels ( Fig. 3 ). The TIMP3 mRNA elevated ~14- and 9-fold on treatment with 1 µmol/L SGI-1027 and decitabine, respectively ( Fig. 3 A ). Treatment with SGI-1027 or decitabine for longer periods did not further increase TIMP3 expression (data not presented). Reactivation of P16 and MLH1 was obvious after 7 days of exposure to SGI-1027 or decitabine ( Fig. 3 B ). Interestingly, SGI-1027 was superior to decitabine with respect to its ability to reexpress both genes after 7 days of treatment ( Fig. 3 C ). P16 expression increased 2- and 3.5-fold after treatment with 1 µmol/L decitabine and SGI-1027, respectively. Treatment with 2.5 µmol/L decitabine and SGI-1027 resulted in 4- and 8-fold increase in P16 mRNA, respectively. We also determined the protein levels of TIMP3 and P16 after treatment with 1 and 2.5 µmol/L of the drugs. TIMP3 protein was significantly higher in the SGI-1027–treated cells compared with the decitabine-treated cells, which was consistent with changes in the mRNA levels ( Fig. 3 D ). Similarly, a dose-dependent increase in the P16 protein level was observed in cells in response to both drugs. Importantly, SGI-1027–treated cells exhibited 5-fold increase in the level of P16 protein compared with that with decitabine.  SGI-1027 treatment can reactivate silenced TSGs Many TSGs are silenced in different cancer cells due to hypermethylation of CpG islands in their promoters. The TSGs P16, MLH1 , and TIMP3 are epigenetically silenced in RKO cells ( 22 , 32 , 33 ).

The TIMP3 mRNA elevated ~14- and 9-fold on treatment with 1 µmol/L SGI-1027 and decitabine, respectively ( Fig. 3 A ). Treatment with SGI-1027 or decitabine for longer periods did not further increase TIMP3 expression (data not presented). Reactivation of P16 and MLH1 was obvious after 7 days of exposure to SGI-1027 or decitabine ( Fig. 3 B ). Interestingly, SGI-1027 was superior to decitabine with respect to its ability to reexpress both genes after 7 days of treatment ( Fig. 3 C ). P16 expression increased 2- and 3.5-fold after treatment with 1 µmol/L decitabine and SGI-1027, respectively. Treatment with 2.5 µmol/L decitabine and SGI-1027 resulted in 4- and 8-fold increase in P16 mRNA, respectively. We also determined the protein levels of TIMP3 and P16 after treatment with 1 and 2.5 µmol/L of the drugs. TIMP3 protein was significantly higher in the SGI-1027–treated cells compared with the decitabine-treated cells, which was consistent with changes in the mRNA levels ( Fig. 3 D ). Similarly, a dose-dependent increase in the P16 protein level was observed in cells in response to both drugs. Importantly, SGI-1027–treated cells exhibited 5-fold increase in the level of P16 protein compared with that with decitabine.  P16 and TIMP3 CpG islands are demethylated on treatment of cancer cells with SGI-1027 To determine whether reexpression of the TSGs on prolonged treatment of colon cancer cells with SGI-1027 was due to demethylation of their CpG islands, we performed methylation-specific PCR analysis of the P16 and TIMP3 genes in RKO cells. We analyzed the region of P16 gene that was shown to be methylated in cancer cells ( 21 ). We used two different reverse primers specific for unmethylated and methylated CpG islands of exon 1 of P16 . Only methylated amplicons were obtained in untreated RKO cells ( Fig. 4 A ). Substantial amplification of unmethylated CpG island on treatment with SGI-1027 indicates demethylation of the CpG island in P16 exon 1. As expected, the methylation-specific primers could generate ampli cons after bisulfite treatment only in untreated RKO cells but not in normal colon ( Fig. 4 A ). The SGI-1027–induced demethylation of this region was comparable with that obtained with decitabine. Both drugs facilitated significant demethylation of P16 gene after treatment for 15 days. A similar protocol was used to establish demethylation of TIMP3 promoter by SGI-1027. Here again, only methylation-specific primers could generate amplicon from untreated RKO cells ( Fig. 4 B . On the other hand, significant amplification was observed with the nonmethylation-specific primers in SGI-1027–treated (5–7 days) cells that was consistent with that achieved with normal human colon sample ( Fig. 4 B ). To confirm demethylation of CpG island, we also performed COBRA of TIMP3 gene. The result showed significantly reduced (~60%) digestion of the amplicon with Taq I obtained from bisulfite-treated DNA from SGI-1027–treated cells as opposed to its complete digestion in untreated cells ( Fig. 4 C ). This result coupled with the RT-PCR data therefore proves that SGI-1027 reactivates the silenced P16 and TIMP3 genes by demethylation of their respective CpG islands. The next obvious question was whether SGI-1027 treatment of cancer cells caused genome-wide demethylation. To address this issue, we measured methyl cytosine to cytosine content of genomic DNA by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. However, methyl cytosine content was not significantly altered in RKO cells treated with the inhibitor ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). This result shows that SGI-1027 specifically demethylates the CpG islands of TSGs without global hypomethylation.  P16 and TIMP3 CpG islands are demethylated on treatment of cancer cells with SGI-1027 To determine whether reexpression of the TSGs on prolonged treatment of colon cancer cells with SGI-1027 was due to demethylation of their CpG islands, we performed methylation-specific PCR analysis of the P16 and TIMP3 genes in RKO cells.

On the other hand, significant amplification was observed with the nonmethylation-specific primers in SGI-1027–treated (5–7 days) cells that was consistent with that achieved with normal human colon sample ( Fig. 4 B ).

This result shows that SGI-1027 specifically demethylates the CpG islands of TSGs without global hypomethylation.  Treatment with SGI-1027 results in selective degradation of DNMT1 in a wide variety of human cancer cell lines Our earlier study has shown selective degradation of DNMT1, the major DNMT, induced by decitabine (5-azadC) in human cancer cell lines ( 16 ). We were therefore curious to know whether SGI-1027, which inhibits the enzyme activity by a different mechanism, can also induce degradation of DNMT1. We measured DNMT1 levels by immunoblot analysis of extracts from the HCT116 cells treated with the drug. Treatment of the cells with 5 µmol/L SGI-1027 for 24 h resulted in ~ 95% depletion of DNMT1, which was comparable with that achieved with decitabine ( Fig. 5 A , left ). Like decitabine, SGI-1027 had either no effect or minimal effect on DNMT3A or DNMT3B protein levels. This result shows that the reversible and weakly DNA-binding quinoline-based compound selectively induces degradation DNMT1 in human colon cancer cell line, HCT116. Similar degradation of DNMT1 also occurred in another human colon cancer cell line RKO ( Fig. 5 A , right ). To investigate whether SGI-1027 is also effective in other cancer cell types of different tissue origins, the levels of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B protein were measured in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human cervical cancer (HeLa), prostate cancer (LNCaP), and breast cancer (MCF7) cell lines ( Supplementary Fig. S2 A–D ). At 2.5 and 5 µmol/L concentrations, its efficacy was comparable with that of decitabine (95-98%). At 2.5 µmol/L concentration, DNMT1 was completely degraded in MCF7 and HCC cells, whereas higher concentrations of the inhibitor were required for complete depletion of DNMT1 in cervical cancer (HeLa) and prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells ( Supplementary Fig. S2 B and C ). These results show that, depending on the cell type, the effective dose of SGI-1027 required for complete degradation of DNMT1 varies. Note that DNMT3A and 3B levels remained virtually unaltered in all cell types on exposure to SGI-1027 as observed with decitabine ( Fig. 5 A ; Supplementary S2 ).

Note that DNMT3A and 3B levels remained virtually unaltered in all cell types on exposure to SGI-1027 as observed with decitabine ( Fig. 5 A ; Supplementary S2 ).  SGI-1027–induced degradation of DNMT1 is an early event that occurs via proteasomal pathway To determine whether DNMT1 degradation is initiated at an early stage of drug treatment, we performed Western blot analysis with extracts from the HCT116 cells treated with SGI-1027 for different periods. The results showed that DNMT1 depletion occurs as early as 6 h of treatment. DNMT1 level was reduced to ~ 40% at this time point and almost complete degradation (~90%) was achieved at 24 h ( Fig. 5 B ). To establish the mechanism of SGI-1027–induced degradation of DNMT1, we measured mRNA levels of all three DNMTs by real-time RT-PCR following treatment with the drug. The increase in the mRNA levels of all three after exposure of cells to 2.5 or 5 µmol/L SGI-1027 for 24 h ( Fig. 5 C ) shows that SGI-1027–mediated depletion of DNMT1 ( Fig. 5 A and B ; Supplementary Fig. S2 ) is not due to altered mRNA expression. We then tested the possibility that SGI-1027–mediated depletion of DNMT1 may also be due to rapid degradation of the preformed DNMT1 protein at the post-translational event as observed with decitabine ( 16 ). For this purpose, DNMT1 level was measured in cells treated with the potent proteasomal inhibitor MG132 before exposure to SGI-1027. Under these conditions, the SGI-1027–induced depletion of DNMT1 was significantly blocked in a concentration-dependent manner ( Fig. 5 D ). This result proves that SGI-1027 treatment induces DNMT1 degradation by a proteasomal pathway. Collectively, the data show that SGI-1027 reactivates TSGs by inducing promoter hypomethylation by inactivating all three DNMTases and causing selective degradation of DNMT1, the major maintenance DNMTase.

SGI-1027 exhibits minimal or no cytotoxic effect in rat hepatoma cells To explore the advantages of SGI-1027 over 5-aza compounds as a DNA hypomethylating agent, we investigated the antioxidant and cytotoxic effects of SGI-1027 in a metabolically active rat hepatoma cell line (H4IIE). On exposure of the cells to different concentrations of SGI-1027, we analyzed cell proliferation and the level of antioxidant enzyme GST (as a measure of membrane leakage/toxicity) and mitochondrial function. Cell proliferation assay showed a linear decrease in cell number with increasing doses of SGI-1027 exposure ( Fig. 6 A ), indicating its growth-inhibitory effect in this cell line. However, SGI-1027 exerted similar growth-inhibitory effects in colon cancer cells (HCT116 and RKO; data not shown). Again, there was no change in the level of GST on exposure of the cells to SGI-1027 at any concentration tested ( Fig. 6 A ). This result further shows that SGI-1027 exerts its growth-inhibitory effect without showing any cellular membrane toxicity. The effect of SGI-1027 on the mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using rhodamine B and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Rhodamine B distributes across the biological membranes in response to the electrical transmembrane potential. However, with increasing concentrations of SGI-1027 up to 20 µmol/L, the limit of its solubility, a less pronounced decrease in transmembrane potential was noticed ( Fig. 6 A ). The corresponding linear increase in cellular ATP levels probably protects the cells from cytotoxicity induced by SGI-1027. Reduced GSH and related enzymes, such as GSTs (phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes), are important cellular defense against oxidative stress. To investigate potential induction of oxidative stress by SGI-1027, we measured the cellular GSH level after 24 h exposure of the rat hepatoma cells at different concentrations of the drug. There was a linear increase in cellular GSH level up to 20 µmol/L concentration of SGI-1027 ( Fig. 6 B ). On the other hand, there was almost no change in the level of GST ( Fig. 6 A ). A minimal increase in the level of GSH alone probably explains a very low level oxidative stress induced by SGI-1027, which can be counteracted by GSH only in the absence of its interacting detoxifying partner GST. In recent years, measurement of 8-isoprostane in cells and plasma has emerged as one of the ideal markers of oxidative stress ( 34 ). There was no change in the level of cellular 8-isoprostane level on exposure to SGI-1027 at any concentration tested ( Fig. 6 B ). These data further show that SGI-1027 does not exhibit any cytotoxic effect. We next examined the potential growth-inhibitory property of SGI-1027 by inducing apoptosis. Because caspase-3 activation plays a key role during initiation of apoptosis, we measured cellular caspase-3 levels after incubation of cells for 24 h with different concentrations of SGI-1027. There was no change in the level of caspase-3 up to 20 µmol/L concentration (the limit of solubility of SGI-1027; Fig. 6 C ). This result suggests that SGI-1027 does not have any role in induction of apoptosis.

This result suggests that SGI-1027 does not have any role in induction of apoptosis.  Discussion Many TSGs are silenced in different types of cancer due to promoter methylation ( 20 , 35 – 38 ). The reexpression of these genes with inhibitors of DNMT forms the basis of epigenetic therapy of cancer ( 7 , 9 – 11 ). Although the DNA hypomethylating agents 5-azaC and 5-azadC and their analogues have been used in cancer therapy, particularly in the treatment of liquid tumors ( 41 ), their instability in solution and toxicity largely due to their incorporation into DNA have limited their clinical applications. Additionally, 5-azaC can also be incorporated into RNA leading to inhibition of protein synthesis, and both 5-aza compounds can inhibit thymidylate synthase following their deamination into the respective uridines and conversion into UMP. In efforts to circumvent the cytotoxicity of the nucleoside DNMT inhibitors, a few nonnucleoside small-molecule inhibitors of DNMTs have been developed. Some of these compounds can directly block the DNMT activity and do not appear to have the toxicity associated with their incorporation into DNA. The DNMT inhibitor (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate has been found to bind and block the active site of human DNMT1 and reactivate the silenced genes in human cancer cell lines ( 42 ). A disadvantage of this compound is its generation of hydrogen peroxide, which contributes to its toxicity in human cell lines. Another nonnucleoside small-molecule inhibitor of DNMT, RG-108, has been reported to be very effective in inhibiting the catalytic activity of purified recombinant DNMT by blocking the active site of the enzyme while exhibiting relatively low toxicity in human cancer cell lines ( 15 , 43 ). However, this compound did not induce degradation of DNMT. Interestingly, two drugs used for other applications (procaine, a local anesthetic, and procainamide, an antiarrhythmic drug) exhibit DNA demethylating activity ( 44 ). In addition to the commonly acknowledged toxic effects, relatively high concentrations of these drugs are required for their demethylating activities. Further, they are not effective in all cell lines tested ( 45 ). Procaine appears to interfere with DNMTs by binding strongly to GC-rich DNA ( 44 ). Psammaplins were also reported to inhibit DNMT activity in a cell-free assay system, but their inhibitory mechanism has not clearly been shown ( 46 ). None of these drugs appear to be promising candidates for epigenetic therapy of cancer. We have shown that a novel class of synthetic quinoline-based nonnucleoside compounds ( 28 ) exhibits the potential for demethylation and restoration of normal function of tumor suppressors. One of these compounds, designated SGI-1027, is able to demethylate and reactivate three different TSGs in human cancer cells. A unique property of SGI-1027 and probably other compounds in this class is that, unlike the nucleoside compounds, it is not incorporated into DNA and yet inhibits DNMT activity. A striking difference between SGI-1027 and the commonly used DNA hypomethylating agents 5-azaC or 5-azadC is the direct inhibition of DNMT of both mammalian and bacterial origin in vitro by SGI-1027. An unexpected observation is the SGI-1027–induced rapid proteasomal degradation of DNMT1 in a variety of cancer cell types as observed for 5-aza compounds ( 16 ). Although DNMT1 is selectively degraded by this mechanism, the inhibition of the DNMT activity is likely to affect all three DNMTs because the motifs I and X that fold back to form Ado-Met binding sites are conserved ( 47 ). The degradation of DNMT1 by two structurally unrelated DNA hypomethylating agents suggests activation of a common signal transduction pathway(s) in response to these drugs. It is important to identify the signaling pathway responsible for the DNMT1 degradation and the common mechanism for activating this pathway, which is beyond the scope of the present study. It is noteworthy that a comparative study on effects of different nucleoside and nonnucleoside inhibitors of DNMTs in a variety of assays ( 43 ) showed that, unlike 5-azaC or decitabine, zebularine, procaine, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and RG108 are not able to demethylate and reactivate TIMP3 . In the present study, SGI-1027 displayed significant reactivation of TIMP3 that was comparable with that observed with decitabine. Similar to RG108 and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, SGI-1027 can inhibit Sss I methylase and mammalian DNMTases in vitro that is not exhibited by 5-azaC, decitabine, zebularine, or procaine. Finally, an alternative approach to epigenetic therapy is to use a combined regimen of inhibitors of DNMTs and HDACs. The advantage of this strategy is that a relatively low dose of DNMT inhibitors can be used to minimize their toxicities and achieve a synergistic effect on activation of the silenced genes ( 32 , 40 , 48 ). Although SGI-1027 exhibits minimal toxicity, reducing the levels of HDAC inhibitors to attain maximal response when combined with SGI-1027 could emerge as a promising therapeutic approach to regress tumor growth. Many novel HDAC inhibitors have been synthesized and tested for their efficacy in transcriptional activation of genes ( 49 ). It would be worthwhile to determine an optimal combination of the promising HDAC inhibitors and SGI-1027 to achieve maximal expression of the silenced genes.
