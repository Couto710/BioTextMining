Cardiovascular toxicities: clues to optimal administration of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway inhibitors Several angiogenesis inhibitors have been approved for commercial use and many additional agents are under development for the treatment of various malignancies. Cardiovascular toxicities have been increasingly recognized as effects of this entire class of new anticancer therapeutics. There is a limited but growing understanding of the mechanism of action of these drugs in the human cancer patient and the factors affecting the therapeutic index. In addition to reviewing current concepts for the cardiovascular toxicities of angiogenesis inhibitors, we discuss how better understanding the pharmacologic basis for these effects could optimize their use for individual patients.
