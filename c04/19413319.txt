Cyclic Pyrrole-Imidazole Polyamides Targeted to the Androgen Response Element Hairpin pyrrole-imidazole polyamides are a class of cell-permeable DNA-binding small molecules that can disrupt transcription factor-DNA binding and regulate endogenous gene expression. The covalent linkage of antiparallel Py-Im ring pairs with an ?-amino acid turn unit affords the classical hairpin Py-Im polyamide structure. Closing the hairpin with a second turn unit yields a cyclic polyamide, a lesser-studied architecture mainly attributable to synthetic inaccessibility. We have applied our methodology for solution-phase polyamide synthesis to cyclic polyamides with an improved high yield cyclization step. Cyclic 8-ring Py-Im polyamides 1-3 targets the DNA sequence 5?-WGWWCW-3? which corresponds to the androgen response element (ARE) bound by the androgen receptor transcription factor to activate gene expression. We find that cyclic Py-Im polyamides 1-3 bind DNA with exceptional high affinities and regulate the expression of AR target genes in cell culture studies from which we infer the cycle is cell permeable.  Introduction Modulating the expression of eukaryotic gene networks by small molecules is a challenge at the frontier of chemical biology. Pyrrole-imidazole polyamides are a class of cell-permeable small molecules that bind to the minor groove of DNA in a sequence specific manner. 1 , 2 Side-by-side stacking of N -methylpyrrole (Py) and N -methylimidazole (Im) carboxamides (Im/Py pairs) distinguish G•C from C•G base pairs, whereas Py/Py pairs specify for both T•A and A•T. 3 Py-Im hairpin polyamides have been programmed for a broad repertoire of DNA sequences with affinities similar to endogenous transcription factors. 4 They are cell permeable and influence gene transcription by disrupting protein-DNA interfaces. 2 , 5 , 6 Hairpin polyamide interference of DNA binding by transcription factors such as HIF-1?, 7 androgen receptor (AR), 8 and AP-1 9 has been described in recent years, yielding a new approach towards gene control by small molecules. In parallel with our gene regulation studies, a significant effort has been devoted to maximizing the biological potency of hairpin Py-Im polyamides through structural modifications. In particular, we have recently demonstrated that hairpin polyamides bearing the ( R )-?-amino-?-turn, such as polyamide 4 , possess favorable binding affinities to DNA and are useful in gene regulation studies ( Figure 1 ). 5g A significant effort exists in our laboratory to regulate aberrant AR-activated gene expression in prostate cancer. 8 To further optimize lead oligomer 4 it would seem reasonable that closing the hairpin with an identical linker, yielding a cyclic structure 1 , may further enhance DNA affinity ( Figure 1 ). Previous syntheses of cyclic polyamides using solid-phase protocols are characterized by low reaction yields due to inefficient macrocyclization. 10 We report here the solution-phase synthesis of cyclic polyamides 1-3 with an improved high yield cyclization step. In addition we examined the DNA binding properties of these compounds by thermal duplex DNA melting as well as preliminary studies of their in vitro ADMET properties. Cyclic Py-Im polyamides 1-3 were shown to regulate endogenous gene expression in cell culture experiments.  Results and Discussion Solution-Phase Synthesis of Cyclic Polyamides Due to the symmetrical nature of cyclic polyamides 1-3 and their sequence similarity to previously described hairpin polyamide 4 , 11 PyPyPy trimer 6 and Im-turn dimer 7 provide all the necessary atoms to synthesize 1-3 . The preparation of advanced intermediates 6 and 7 have been detailed in the preceding paper 11 from readily available building blocks. 12 The cornerstone of our synthesis strategy capitalizes on the disparate physical properties of starting materials versus products, which permit purification of most intermediates to be achieved by combinations of precipitation, trituration, and crystallization. In addition, in situ deprotection of advanced pentafluorophenyl ester polyamide 14 at high dilution leads to macrocyclization in high yield affording cyclic polyamide 15 . The synthesis of tetramer-turn 9 begins with Im-turn dimer 7 ( Scheme 1 ). Saponification of 7 with aqueous KOH in methanol at 37 °C, followed by neutralization, precipitation, and Et2O trituration, yields Im-turn acid 8 in 95% yield. Amide coupling of 8 with pyrrole trimer 6 provides pentamer 9 in 96% yield. The utilization of a small excess of 6 relative to 8 drives the reaction to completion, and residual 6 is readily separated from 9 following precipitation in water and aqueous washing of residual solid 9 . With all atoms in place for the target cyclic polyamide 1 , compound 9 was elaborated to amine salt 10 (99% yield) by reaction with HCl in 1,4-dioxane. Carboxylic acid 11 was generated by saponification of 10 with NaOH in 1,4-dioxane in 95 % yield. Assembly of the acyclic advanced intermediate 12 was achieved by PyBOP-mediated coupling of intermediates 10 and 11 in 94 % yield ( Scheme 2 ). A small excess of amine salt 10 was utilized to drive the reaction to completion. Saponification of ester 12 proceeded smoothly with aqueous NaOH in 1,4-dioxane, yielding 13 in 93% yield. Activation of acid 13 as the pentafluorophenol ester 14 provided the necessary functionality to afford macrocyclization following removal of the terminal t-butyl carbamate (Boc) protecting group. In our hands, we found the pentafluorophenol ester sufficiently activated the terminal acid for amide coupling while avoiding undesired oligomerization and/or decomposition processes that are conceivable with more reactive functionalities, such as acid chlorides. Premature initiation of the macrocyclization reaction was tempered by keeping the terminal amine protonated until transferred into a dilute solution of acetonitrile. Addition of an amine base (DIEA) then generated the free terminal amine, which could then undergo macrocyclization in dilute solvent conditions to deliver 15 , which was directly deprotected. The benzyl carbamate protecting groups were cleaved by treatment with superacid conditions (trifluoromethylsulfonic acid-trifluoroacetic acid) to provide 1 in 68% yield over 3 steps. Controlled acetylation of 1 by reaction with sub-stoichiometric quantities of Ac2O in NMP/DIEA provided a statistical population of 1 (18%), 2 (40%), and 3 (22%) that were easily separable by preparative HPLC. Acetylated hairpin 5 was prepared using excess Ac2O/pyridine in 95% yield from previously reported amine hairpin 4 . 11 Thermal Stabilization of DNA-duplexes by Polyamides Quantitative DNase I footprint titrations have historically been utilized to measure polyamide-DNA binding affinities and specificities. 13 However, this method is limited to measuring K a values ? 2 × 1010 M-1, which invalidates this technique for quantifying the exceptionally high DNA-binding affinities of cycles 1-3 . 14 The magnitude of DNA thermal stabilization (?Tm) of DNA-polyamide complexes has been utilized to rank order polyamides with high DNA binding affinities. 5g , 15 Accordingly, we have employed melting temperature analysis (?Tm) for dissecting differences in DNA-binding affinities of hairpin versus cyclic polyamides. Spectroscopic analyses were performed on a 14-mer duplex DNA mimicking the androgen response element (ARE) DNA sequence, 5?-TTGCTGTTCTGCAA-3? DNA duplex, which contains one polyamide binding site. As shown in Table 1 polyamides 1-5 provided an increase in the duplex DNA melting temperature relative to the individual DNA duplex, thereby confirming polyamide-DNA binding. Chiral hairpin 4 led to an increased melting temperature ?Tm = 18.4 °C whereas cyclic polyamide 1 yielded a higher ?Tm-value of 23.6 °C. Cyclic polyamides 1-3 reveal stronger stabilizations than parent hairpin analogs 4 and 5 . Acylation of the ?-amino turns was shown to decrease the thermal stabilization values in both hairpin and cyclic motifs, presumably due to the loss of the electrostatic benefit of the cation protonated amine on the turn unit. Biological Assay for Cell Permeability Hairpin polyamides have been shown to modulate endogenous gene expression in living cells by disrupting transcription factor-DNA binding in gene promoters. 2 , 7 - 9 Recently, hairpin polyamide 4 was shown to inhibit androgen receptor-mediated expression of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in LNCaP cells by targeting the DNA sequence 5?-AGAACA-3? found in the ARE. 8 We utilized this cell culture transcription assay to investigate the biological activity of cyclic polyamides 1-3 in comparison to hairpin polyamides 4 and 5 . Since small structural changes to polyamides have been shown to correlate with differences in cellular uptake properties, 5 it was not obvious whether cyclic polyamides 1-3 would permeate cell membranes and exhibit biological activity comparable to hairpin polyamides 4 and 5 . Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of DHT-induced PSA expression revealed cyclic polyamides 1-3 all decreased PSA mRNA levels in LNCaP cells, with cycle 1 exhibiting comparable activity to acetylated hairpin polyamide 5 ( Figure 2 ). Based on these results we can infer that this class of cyclic Py-Im polyamides are cell permeable and can regulate endogenous gene expression in cell culture. ADMET Studies of Polyamides <bold>1</bold> and <bold>5</bold> Due to the promising cell culture results obtained with cyclic polyamide 1 and hairpin polyamide 5 against PSA gene expression, we contracted preclinical in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) 17 studies for both compounds. 18 Results from this study are summarized as follows and additional detail can be found in the Supporting Information . Polyamides 1 and 5 were both found to exhibit low Caco-2 permeability, suggesting neither compound may be orally available. Both 1 and 5 were found to be almost exclusively protein bound in plasma with half-lives greater than 2 h. A recent positron emission tomography (PET)-based biodistribution study of a related hairpin polyamide in mice revealed high levels of liver occupancy following tail vein dosage. 19 Based on this result we investigated the liver stability of candidate polyamides 1 and 5 . Microsomal intrinsic clearance studies found half-lives greater than 3 hr for 1 and 5 in both human and rat liver microsomes, and no significant inhibition was measured against any cytochrome P450 isoform examined (Cyp1A2/CEC, Cyp2C8/DBF, Cyp2C9/DBF, Cyp2C19/DBF, Cyp2D6/AMMC, Cyp3A4/BFC, Cyp3A4/DBF). Furthermore, no obvious toxicity (IC50 > 100 ?M) was observed in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. In addition, standard hERG FastPatch assays of cardiac toxicity found both polyamides ( 1 and 5 ) were devoid of unwanted inhibition (IC50 > 100 ?M).

Conclusion We describe a solution-phase synthesis methodology for preparing cyclic Py-Im polyamides, highlighted by an efficient macrocyclization between the alkyl linker amine and a pentafluorophenyl ester-activated amino acid. The three cyclic Py-Im polyamides possessed high DNA-binding affinities and were capable of accessing the nucleus in cell culture as judged by their ability to downregulate AR-activated PSA expression in cell culture. Preclinical ADMET analysis of cyclic polyamide 1 and hairpin polyamide 5 revealed favorable drug-like properties such as high liver stability and low toxicity. Ongoing work is focused on characterizing the precise molecular interactions between cyclic polyamides and their cognate DNA sequences by high-resolution crystallographic studies.  Experimental Section General Chemicals and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used without further purification. ( R )-3,4-Cbz-Dbu(Boc)-OH was purchased from Senn Chemicals AG (code number 44159). All DNA oligomers were purchased HPLC purified from Integrated DNA Technologies. Water (18 M?) was purified using a Millipore MilliQ purification system. Centrifugation was performed in a Beckman Coulter bench-top centrifuge (Allegra 21R) equipped with a Beckman swing-out rotor (model S4180). Analytical HPLC analysis was conducted on a Beckman Gold instrument equipped with a Phenomenex Gemini analytical column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 ?m), a diode array detector, and the mobile phase consisted of a gradient of acetonitrile (MeCN) in 0.1% (v/v) aqueous CF3CO2H. Preparative HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1200 system equipped with a solvent degasser, diode array detector, and a Phenomenex Gemini column (250 × 21.2 mm, 5 ?m). A gradient of MeCN in 0.1% (v/v) aqueous CF3CO2H was utilized as the mobile phase. UV-Vis measurements were made on a Hewlett-Packard diode array spectrophotometer (Model 8452 A) and polyamide concentrations were measured in 0.1% (v/v) aqueous CF3CO2H using an extinction coefficient of 69200 M-1·cm-1 at ?max near 310 nm. NMR spectroscopy was performed on a Varian instrument operating at 499.8 MHz (for 1H) or 125.7 MHz (for 13C) at ambient temperature. All NMR analyses were performed in DMSO- d 6, and chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to the internal solvent peak referenced to 2.49 (for 1H) or 39.5 (for 13C). High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was recorded in positive-ion mode by fast-atom bombardment (FAB+) on a JOEL JMS-600H instrument or by electrospray ionization (ESI+) on a Waters Acquity UPLC-LCT Premiere XE TOF-MS system. UV Absorption Spectrophotometry Melting temperature analysis was performed on a Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermo-controlled cell holder possessing a cell path length of 1 cm. A degassed aqueous solution of 10 mM sodium cacodylate, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM CaCl2 at pH 7.0 was used as analysis buffer. DNA duplexes and hairpin polyamides were mixed in 1:1 stoichiometry to a final concentration of 2 ?M for each experiment. Prior to analysis, samples were heated to 90 °C and cooled to a starting temperature of 23 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min for each ramp. Denaturation profiles were recorded at ? = 260 nm from 23 °C to 90 °C with a heating rate of 0.5 °C/min. The reported melting temperatures were defined as the maximum of the first derivative of the denaturation profile. Measurement of Androgen-Induced PSA mRNA Experiments were performed as described previously 8 with the following modifications: (1) all compounds and controls were prepared in neat DMSO then diluted with media to a final concentration of 0.1% DMSO, and (2) mRNA was isolated with the RNEasy 96 kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).

Table 1 Tm values for polyamides for 1 - 5 a Polyamides T m/°C ? T m/°C - 60.0 (±0.3) - 83.5 (±0.5) 23.6 (±0.6) 81.2 (±0.2) 21.3 (±0.4) 82.0 (±0.0) 22.1 (±0.3) 78.4 (±0.5) 18.4 (±0.6) 76.0 (±0.5) 16.1 (±0.6) a All values reported are derived from at least three melting temperature experiments with standard deviations indicated in parentheses. ?Tm values are given as Tm(DNA/polyamide) - Tm(DNA). The propagated error in ?Tm measurements is the square root of the sum of the square of the standard deviations for the Tm values.
