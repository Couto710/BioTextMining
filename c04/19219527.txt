Virulence factor genotypes of Helicobacter pylori affect cure rates of eradication therapy The cure rates of Helicobacter pylori infection by using a combination of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and antimicrobial agents are mainly influenced by bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobial agents and the magnitude of acid inhibition during the treatment. Currently used empirical triple therapies do not reliably produce a ?80% cure rate on an intention-to-treat basis. Therefore, tailored regimens based on relevant microbiological findings and pharmacogenomics are recommended for attaining an acceptable ?95% cure rate. Recently, virulence factors of H. pylori , such as cagA and vacA , are reported to be major factors determining the cure rates. Individuals infected with strains with cagA -negative and vacA s2 genotypes have significantly increased risk of eradication failure of H. pylori infection. These virulence factors enhance gastric mucosal inflammation and are associated with the development of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. H. pylori virulence factors induce proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?, which influence mucosal inflammation and/or gastric acid secretion. When physicians select an H. pylori eradication regimen with an acceptable cure rate, they might need to consider H. pylori virulence factors, especially cagA and vacA .  INTRODUCTION Eradication therapy of Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) infection is already accepted as the first-line treatment for patients with gastroduodenal disorders, such as peptic ulcer diseases, gastric mucosa associated-lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, atrophic gastritis, hyperplastic polyp, and post-endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, as well as for patients with some extra-gastrointestinal disorders, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and iron-deficiency anemia ( Annibale et al. 1999 ; Emilia et al. 2001 ; Gasbarrini et al. 1998 ; Hopkins et al. 1996 ; Sugimoto et al. 2006 ; Take et al. 2005 ; Uemura et al. 1997 ; Uemura et al. 2001 ; Wong et al. 2004 ; Wotherspoon et al. 1994 ). After the cure of H. pylori infection, the relapse rates of peptic ulcer diseases are dramatically reduced and most peptic ulcer complications, such as hemorrhage, perforation, and abdominal symptoms, can be also dramatically prevented ( Bayerdorffer et al. 1995 ; Hopkins et al. 1996 ). Eradication therapy also markedly decreases the development of gastric cancer and MALT lymphoma ( Uemura 2001 ). As with other bacterial infections, successful treatment of H. pylori infection depends on the use of antibiotics to which the organism is susceptible. Recently, the usefulness of a therapy report card, similar to that used to grade the performance of school children, was proposed, the goal of therapy being to consistently cure more than 95% of patients on an intention-to-treat basis (grade A) ( Graham et al. 2007 ). Traditional clarithromycin-containing triple therapy with a combination of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (e.g. lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, or rabeprazole), amoxicillin, and clarithromycin does not reliably produce a ?80% cure rate, mainly due to the increased prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant strains ( Graham et al. 2007 ; Graham et al. 2008 ). The cure rates of H. pylori infection are affected by several major factors, including bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics and the genotypes of host factors, such as cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19), multidrug resistance transporter-1 (MDR1), and proinflammatory cytokine polymorphisms ( Table 1 ) ( Graham et al. 2008 ; Megraud and Lamouliatte 2003 ; Sugimoto et al. 2007 ). Smoking habit, compliance, duration of eradication therapy, and gastric emptying have also been reported to affect the cure rates ( Graham et al. 2008 ; Kamada et al. 1999 ; Megraud and Lamouliatte 2003 ). However, it is usually difficult to reach the excellent levels of grade A by using current regimens (see below). Therefore we need to consider other factors which increase or decrease the cure rate of H. pylori infection to reach the grade A. Virulence factors of H. pylori (e.g. cagA and vacA ) play important roles in gastric mucosal injury, such as gastric inflammation, peptic ulcer, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and malignancy ( Broutet et al. 2003 ; van der Hulst et al. 1996 ). Patients with peptic ulcer diseases are reported to be more easily treated than those with non-ulcer dyspepsia; therefore, virulence factors are thought to influence the cure rates of H. pylori infection ( Broutet et al. 2003 ; van der Hulst et al. 1996 ). In fact, the importance of H. pylori virulence markers in the efficacy of the cure rates has been reported ( Table 2 and 3 ). However, the results are controversial and it is still unclear whether H. pylori virulence factors really influence the cure rates of H. pylori infection. In this review article we first review the causes of failure for H. pylori eradication therapy and then summarize the effects of H. pylori virulence factors on H. pylori eradication therapy. Finally, we provide recommendations for advanced H. pylori eradication therapy in relation to H. pylori virulence factors to obtain a cure rate of grade A.  ERADICATION THERAPY AND CAUSES OF FAILURE OF <italic>H. PYLORI</italic> ERADICATION THERAPY Resistance to antibiotics and H. pylori eradication therapy Infection with antibiotic-resistant H. pylori strains undoubtedly influences the success or failure of H. pylori eradication therapy. Recently, the prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant strains has gradually increased year by year in some countries (e.g. Japan), probably due to increased usage of clarithromycin (e.g. in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and chronic otitis media). More than half of patients without successful eradication therapy are reported to be infected with clarithromycin-resistant strains ( Furuta et al. (2001) , and therefore the cure rates attained by the traditional clarithromycin-containing triple therapy is now decreasing and the traditional triple therapy remains effective only when used to treat infections with susceptible organisms ( Graham et al. 2007 ; Graham et al. 2008 ). To increase the cure rates of initial treatment, currently recommended therapies include sequential therapy (sequential administration of a dual therapy [a PPI plus amoxicillin] for 5 days followed by the PPI plus clarithromycin and tinidazole or metronidazole for 5 days), bismuth-containing quadruple therapy, and therapy with a PPI plus amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and tinidazole or metronidazole for 7–14 days) ( Graham et al. 2008 ). Amoxicillin- and tetracycline-resistant strains are both relatively rare, irrespective of the country ( Adamek et al. 1998 ; Boyanova et al. 2008 ; Furuta 2001 ), and bismuth-resistance strains do not occur; therefore these three drugs can be key drugs in H. pylori eradication therapies. Similarly to clarithromycin, the prevalence of metronidazole-resistance strains is also increasing in most countries (e.g. 20–70% in some parts of Southeast Asian and European countries ( Megraud 1998 ) and regimens with increased doses of metronidazole or containing antibiotics sensitive to H. pylori should be routinely used in these areas. Recently, new drugs such as fluoroquinolones (e.g. levofloxacin), furazolidone, and rifabutin have also been considered as the recommended alternative treatments ( Cammarota et al. 2000 ; Gisbert and Morena 2006 ; Isomoto H, Inoue et al. 2003 ; Kawakami et al. 2006 ; Megraud 1998 ; Murakami et al. 2003 ; Nagahara et al. 2004 ; Saad et al. 2006 ; Sharara et al. 2006 ; Shimoyama et al. 2004 ). For example, the cure rates of patients with both metronidazole- and clarithromycin-resistant strains are reported to be 92% (95% CI: 83.2–96.7%) if the strains are sensitive to levofloxacin ( Gatta et al. 2005 ). In Europe, primary resistance to levofloxacin has been reported to be infrequent (8–9.6%) ( Gatta et al. 2005 ); therefore levofloxacin-based therapy can be used as the second-line treatment in countries where the prevalence of levofloxacin-resistant strains is low. In contrast, primary levofloxacin resistance is more common (around 15%) in Japan ( Miyachi et al. 2006 ), so levofloxacin-based therapy might be the third-line, but not second-line, treatment option in there. Gastric acid inhibition and H. pylori eradication therapy Insufficient gastric acid inhibition during treatment also causes eradication failure because it makes antibiotics, especially clarithromycin and amoxicillin, more unstable and degraded in the stomach and minimizes the antimicrobial effects of antibiotics ( Grayson et al. 1989 ; Hunt 1993 ). Therefore, gastric acid secretion must be potently inhibited during treatment by using acid-inhibitory drugs such as PPIs ( Peterson 1997 ). Raising pH from 3.5 to 5.5 increases the in vitro effectiveness of amoxicillin more than 10-fold ( Grayson et al. 1989 ). In fact, the 24-hour intragastric pH during eradication therapy in cured patients was significantly higher than in failure patients. It was reported that in cases in which the percentage of time of intragastric of pH<4.0 was <10% and the average 24-hour intragastric pH was <6.0 during eradication therapy, some patients could be cured of H. pylori infection irrespective of the bacterial susceptibility to clarithromycin ( Sugimoto et al. 2007 ). Recent advances in pharmacotherapeutics have demonstrated that the doses, dosing schemes, and types of acid-inhibitory drugs (PPI and/or histamine 2-receptor antagonist [H2RA]) as well as polymorphisms of CYP2C19, MDR1 gene, and inflammation-related cytokine genes (e.g. IL-1? and TNF-?) are influential factors contributing to gastric acid secretion during treatment. PPIs undergo extensive hepatic metabolism by the CYP system ( Ishizaki and Horai 1999 ) and polymorphisms of CYP2C19 influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PPIs ( Sugimoto et al. 2004 ; Sugimoto et al. 2005 ). The cure rates of H. pylori infection by a triple therapy with a PPI (omeprazole 20 mg or lansoprazole 30 mg) b.i.d., amoxicillin 250 mg t.i.d., and clarithromycin 200 mg t.i.d. for one week are reported to significantly depend on CYP2C19 genotype: 72.7% in rapid metabolizers, 92.1% in intermediate metabolizers, and 97.8% in poor metabolizers ( Furuta et al. 2001 ). The cure rates for other PPI-based eradication therapies (i.e. rabeprazole, esomeprazole, or pantoprazole) also differed among the different CYP2C19 genotype groups ( Kurzawski et al. 2006 ; Padol et al. 2006 ). The cure rates in rapid metabolizers infected with clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori strains was dramatically low (7.1%) Furuta et al. ( Furuta et al. 2001 ); therefore, physicians are recommended to screen CYP2C19 polymorphisms and antibiotic resistance in each patient to get a cure rate of grade A. Inflammatory cells infiltrating into the gastric mucosa with H. pylori infection produce several proinflammatory cytokines. Among them, interleukin (IL)-1? and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-? are potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion; IL-1? is reported to be a 100-fold more potent inhibitor than PPIs and a 6000-fold more potent inhibitor than H2RA on a molar basis ( Kondo et al. 1994 ; Wolfe and Nompleggi 1992 ). Therefore the increased production of L-1? and/or TNF-? in the gastric mucosa in response to H. pylori infection would result in an enhanced suppression of gastric acid secretion ( Furuta et al. 2002a ; Furuta et al. 2002b ; Takashima et al. 2001 ; Wang et al. 1999 ). IL-1B -511 polymorphism is associated with cure rates; cure rates in patients with the IL-1B -511 C/C, C/T, and T/T genotypes were reported to be 72.2% (70/97), 87.7% (164/187), and 88.2% (67/76), respectively (p=0.0017) ( Furuta et al. 2004 ; Sugimoto et al. 2006 ). In contrast, there were no significant relationships between the cure rates and polymorphisms of TNF-A -857/-863/-1031 and IL-10 -1082/-819/-592 ( Ishida et al. 2006 ; Sugimoto et al. 2006 ). Although TNF-? potently up-regulates active inflammation by H. pylori infection, the acid-inhibitory effect might not be as potent as that of IL-1? ( Beales and Calam 1998 ). H. pylori eradication therapy and other factors The cure rates of H. pylori infection are also associated with poor compliance of patients ( Megraud and Lamouliatte 2003 ; Wermeille et al. 2002 ). In a meta-analysis, 14-day treatment had higher cure rates than 7-day treatment ( Calvet et al. 2000 ); therefore the treatment period of eradication therapy may be important to the success the therapy. Poor compliance is the same as a lack-of-treatment period, and missing a few doses of drug may lead to eradication failure. Poor compliance is often due to the lack of doctors’ responsibility to explain to the patients in detail about adverse events which might occur but which are usually mild and do not necessitate stopping treatment. A reliable relationship between doctor and patient should also be important for good compliance. When determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibiotics in vitro , it is well known that the bacterial load can influence the cure rates of H. pylori infection, especially for certain antibiotics such as bismuth ( Megraud and Lamouliatte 2003 ). Several studies have confirmed that a high bacterial load plays a role in the risk of eradication failure for both standard bismuth-based triple therapy ( Moshkowitz et al. 1995 ; Sheu et al. 1996 ) and one-week PPI-based triple therapy ( Perri et al. 1998 ).  Resistance to antibiotics and H. pylori eradication therapy Infection with antibiotic-resistant H. pylori strains undoubtedly influences the success or failure of H. pylori eradication therapy. Recently, the prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant strains has gradually increased year by year in some countries (e.g. Japan), probably due to increased usage of clarithromycin (e.g. in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and chronic otitis media). More than half of patients without successful eradication therapy are reported to be infected with clarithromycin-resistant strains ( Furuta et al. (2001) , and therefore the cure rates attained by the traditional clarithromycin-containing triple therapy is now decreasing and the traditional triple therapy remains effective only when used to treat infections with susceptible organisms ( Graham et al. 2007 ; Graham et al. 2008 ).

Several studies have confirmed that a high bacterial load plays a role in the risk of eradication failure for both standard bismuth-based triple therapy ( Moshkowitz et al. 1995 ; Sheu et al. 1996 ) and one-week PPI-based triple therapy ( Perri et al. 1998 ).  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN <italic>H. PYLORI</italic> VIRULENCE FACTORS AND ERADICATION THERAPY As with many infectious diseases, only a fraction of those infected develop clinical disease and, while this general phenomenon remains unexplained, host genetics, host immune response, and the relationships between the host response and bacterial virulence factors appear to play critical roles. Among H. pylori virulence factors, the functions of CagA and VacA are the most intensively studied. cagA status and H. pylori eradication therapy CagA is a highly immunogenic protein encoded by the cagA gene, located at one end of the cag pathogenicity island (PAI). Following injection of CagA into epithelial cells by the cag PAI type IV secretion system, CagA undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) motifs in the 3’ region ( Backert and Selbach 2008 ) and mimics a host cell protein by binding to and activating multiple signaling factors. in vitro infection experiments using gastric epithelial cells co-cultured with H. pylori suggest that several genes in the cag PAI are involved in IL-8 induction (e.g. cagE and cagL ) ( Al-Ghoul et al. 2004 ; Censini et al. 1996 ; Fischer et al. 2001 ). Until recently it was commonly thought that CagA protein per se was not involved in host cell gene expression, including IL-8 induction; however, recent studies suggest that CagA can be associated with IL-8 induction (in a time- and strain-dependent manner, with isogenic cagA mutants of some strains having reduced ability to induce IL-8) ( Brandt et al. 2005 ). H. pylori is divided into cagA -positive and cagA -negative strains, and there is increasing evidence that infection with strains containing a cagA gene are associated with a greater inflammatory response and an increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes than infections with strains lacking the cagA gene in Western countries ( Blaser et al. 1995 ; Yamaoka et al. 2006 ; Yamaoka et al. 2002 ). Interestingly, the prevalence of the cagA -positive strain differs among different countries, and more than 90% of H. pylori strains are cagA positive in East Asian countries, irrespective of clinical presentation ( Yamaoka et al. 2002 ). van der Hulst et al. ( van der Hulst et al. 1997 ) initially reported that cure of H. pylori infection was achieved in a significantly greater number of patients infected with cagA -positive H. pylori (73%, 89/122) compared with those with cagA -negative strains (52%, 17/33; p=0.017; Table 2 ). There were many subsequent studies; eight (50.0%) out of 16 studies supported the original hypothesis and the remaining studies showed that cagA status was independent of the cure rate. There is no contradictory study showing increased failure risk of eradication therapy in cagA -positive strains. As summarized in Table 2 , each eradication regimen used different PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and pantoprazole) and/or antibiotics (clarithromycin, amoxicillin, metronidazole, and tinidazole) and the duration of the treatment also varied from 3 to 14 days. However, there is no significant difference in the overall cure rates (combined cagA -positive and -negative) among the different studies listed in Table 2 ; we therefore combined the data for analysis. As a result, the cure rates in patients infected with cagA -positive strains were 83.1% (95% CI: 80.7–85.3%; 876/1054) and those with cagA -negative strains 69.9% (95% CI: 65.7–73.9%; 349/499), supporting the original hypothesis that cure rates are significantly lower in cagA -negative patients than in cagA -positive patients (p<0.01). Suzuki et al. ( Suzuki et al. 2006 ) also reported that in a meta-analysis, the risk ratio for eradication failure in patients with cagA -negative strain (cure rate: 84%) relative to cagA -positive (73%) was 2.0 (95% CI: 1.6–2.4, p<0.01) and that cagA status and a high proportion of patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia were factors for heterogeneity among studies. From a biological point, the relationship between the success or failure of H. pylori eradication therapy and cagA status has been explained by the enhanced gastric mucosal inflammation. A good correlation between cagA positivity and severe gastric inflammation has been confirmed ( De Francesco et al. 2004 ; van der Hulst et al. 1997 ). Patients with severe inflammatory cell infiltrations in the antral mucosa were associated with significantly higher cure rates compared with those with milder inflammation ( Zanten et al. 1999 ). Since gastric inflammation increases mucosal blood blow, it has been hypothesized that the increased blood flow may help the diffusion of antibiotics ( Maeda et al. 1999 ). As another mechanism, cagA -positive strains are reported to grow faster than cagA -negative strains ( Censini et al. 1996 ; van Doorn et al. 2000 ). Since antibiotics are active during cell division, they are more active on rapidly growing bacteria than on bacteria in resting phase. We also hypothesize that pro-inflammatory cytokine levels should play a role in the cure rates of H. pylori infection. As discussed above, IL-1? is a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion ( Kondo et al. 1994 ; Wolfe and Nompleggi 1992 ) and the increased production of IL-1? in the gastric mucosa in response to H. pylori infection would result in an enhanced suppression of gastric acid secretion ( Furuta et al. 2002a ; Furuta et al. 2002b ; Takashima et al. 2001 ; Wang et al. 1999 ). The cagA -positive strains produce significantly higher IL-1? in gastric mucosa compared with cagA -negative strains ( Yamaoka et al. 1996 ; Yamaoka et al. 1999 ). To obtain a higher cure rate, gastric acid secretion should be potently inhibited during treatment and, thus, cagA -negative strains, which produce less IL-1?, would be less accessible to antibiotics and therefore it would be more difficult to cure H. pylori infection. High H. pylori density in the gastric mucosa and the existence of intestinal metaplasia are reported to decrease cure rates, while a severe neutrophil infiltration is associated with significantly higher cure rates ( Zhao et al. 2007 ). The higher H. pylori density in the antral mucosa enhances antral inflammation and causes lower somatostatin expression. Therefore, gastrin secretion is increased, followed by potent acid secretion, leading to the development of duodenal ulcer ( Atherton et al. 1996 ). In general, it is well known that intestinal metaplasia has a decreased ability of acid secretion due to atrophic change in the corpus mucosa. Therefore, presence of metaplasia with atrophic change is considered to be a protective factor of eradication failure. In addition, cagA -positive stains are reported to be involved in the development of gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia ( Scholte et al. 2002 ). However, Zhao et al. ( Zhao et al. 2007 ) reported that intestinal metaplasia could decrease the cure rates of H. pylori infection and speculated that intestinal metaplasia forms a micro-environment; thus it may cause a drop in H. pylori cure rates. Since there is currently only one report investigating the relationship between gastric atrophy/intestinal metaplasia and cure rates ( Zhao et al. 2007 ), further studies will be required to verify the original reports. The prevalence of cagA -positive strains differs between East Asian and Western countries. In the studies listed in Table 2 , the prevalence of cagA -positive strains is significantly higher in East Asian countries (87.9%, 58/66) than in European countries (64.9%, 848/1306; p<0.01). Accordingly, the cure rates in East Asian countries (86.3%, 57/66) are also significantly higher than in European countries (80.3%, 1049/1306; p<0.01; Table 2 ). To confirm the findings, further studies will be necessary to investigate whether the differences in cure rates among different geographic populations is explained by the prevalence of cagA status. vacA genotypes and H. pylori eradication therapy A single chromosomal copy of the vacA gene is present in essentially all H. pylori strains ( Cover et al. 1994 ). H. pylori VacA is a potent toxin that is secreted into the extracellular space by a type V autotransporter mechanism. Gastric epithelial cell injury is caused by a vacuolating cytotoxin encoded by the vacA gene which induces host cell vacuolation and ultimately cell death. Specific allele variations of vacA exhibit different levels of toxin activity and are associated with different risks of gastrointestinal diseases. The signal (s) region of the vacA gene encodes part of the cytotoxin’s signal peptide and N-terminus, while the middle (m) region encodes part of the 55 K C-terminal subunit. Two types of signal region (s1 and s2) and middle region (m1 and m2) exist and these cause differences in vacuolating activities among individual H. pylori strains ( Atherton et al. 1995 ). The vacA s2 type encodes a shorter extension of the N-terminal peptide on the mature protein, which blocks the vacuolating activity ( Letley and Atherton 2000 ). Conversely, infection with strains of the vacA s1 geno-type has been linked to severe gastric inflammation and duodenal ulcer with enhanced cytotoxin activity. In general, vacA s1 and m1 genotypes produce a large amount of toxin and induce higher vacuolating activity in gastric epithelial cells, whereas s2 and m2 genotypes produce little or no toxin ( Atherton et al. 1995 ; Letley and Atherton 2000 ). Accordingly, vacA s2–m2 strains are reported to be rarely associated with the development of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer ( Atherton et al. 1995 ). Several authors reported a relationship between vacA genotype and cure rates of H. pylori infection ( Table 2 ). Three (37.5%) out of eight previous studies demonstrated significant increased risk of H. pylori eradication failure in H. pylori with vacA s2 genotype compared with s1 genotype ( Table 2 ). On the other hand, there is only one study reporting a significant increased risk of eradication failure in H. pylori with vacA m1 genotype compared with m2 genotype. Similarly to cagA status, each regimen used different PPIs and/or antibiotics with different duration of treatment ( Table 3 ). However, there is no significant difference in the overall cure rates among the different studies listed in Table 3 . Overall, the cure rate in patients infected with the vacA s1 genotypes is 79.2% (95% CI: 75.1–83.0%; 336/424) and with the vacA s2 genotype 72.1% (95% CI: 64.8–78.7%; 124/172; p<0.01). In contrast, the cure rate in patients infected with the vacA m1 genotype is 82.7% (95% CI: 75.1–88.7%; 110/133) and with the vacA m2 genotype 82.3% (95%CI: 75.8–87.6%; 144/175, p=0.92). These results are reasonable since clinical isolates that contain the cagA gene typically also have vacA s1 genotypes ( Yamaoka et al. 2002 ), confirming that highly virulent strains are related to high cure rates. Recently, a third polymorphic determinant of vacuolating activity has been described as located between the s-region and m-region, an intermediate (i) region ( Rhead et al. 2007 ). Recent studies showed that patients infected with vacA i1 strains were closely associated with the development of gastric cancer in Iranian and Italian populations and of gastric ulcer in Iraqi and Italian populations ( Basso et al. 2008 ; Hussein et al. 2008 ; Rhead et al. 2007 ). However, there is currently no report about an association between vacA i-region genotype and eradication therapy. Other virulence factors and H. pylori eradication therapy Approximately 4% of the H. pylori genome is predicted to encode outer membrane proteins, which may function as adhesins and contribute to pathogenesis. One such outer membrane protein is outer inflammatory protein (OipA). The functional status of the oipA gene is regulated by the slipped strand repairing based on the number of CT dinucleotide repeats in the 5’ region of the gene ( Kudo et al. 2004 ; Yamaoka et al. 2002 ; Yamaoka et al. 2000 ). OipA is identified as a proinflammatory response-inducing protein given that oipA mutants reduced induction of IL-8 from gastric epithelial cells ( Yamaoka et al. 2000 ). Functional OipA status is reported to be an independent determinant predictor of duodenal ulcer and is associated with high H. pylori density and severe neutrophil concentration ( Yamaoka et al. 2002 ). Importantly, oipA functional status has been strongly correlated with the cagA -positive and vacA s1 genotype ( Yamaoka et al. 2002 ), suggesting that oipA functional status should be related to higher cure rates. Since OipA is function as an adhesin ( Dossumbekova et al. 2006 ; Yamaoka et al. 2002 ; Yamaoka et al. 2004 ), oipA “on” strains are expected to attach more tightly to the gastric mucosa and to be exposed to the effects of antibiotics more strongly than oipA “off” strains. Surprisingly, however, Treiber et al. (2002) reported that patients infected with oipA “off” strains (94%, 154/163) have higher cure rates compared with oipA “on” strains (87%, 78/88; p<0.05) when using the combination of lansoprazole or rabeprazole, ampicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole for three or five days. Since there is currently only one study investigating OipA status in eradication therapy, future studies will be necessary to investigate the relationship between OipA status and cure rates.  cagA status and H. pylori eradication therapy CagA is a highly immunogenic protein encoded by the cagA gene, located at one end of the cag pathogenicity island (PAI). Following injection of CagA into epithelial cells by the cag PAI type IV secretion system, CagA undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) motifs in the 3’ region ( Backert and Selbach 2008 ) and mimics a host cell protein by binding to and activating multiple signaling factors. in vitro infection experiments using gastric epithelial cells co-cultured with H. pylori suggest that several genes in the cag PAI are involved in IL-8 induction (e.g. cagE and cagL ) ( Al-Ghoul et al. 2004 ; Censini et al. 1996 ; Fischer et al. 2001 ). Until recently it was commonly thought that CagA protein per se was not involved in host cell gene expression, including IL-8 induction; however, recent studies suggest that CagA can be associated with IL-8 induction (in a time- and strain-dependent manner, with isogenic cagA mutants of some strains having reduced ability to induce IL-8) ( Brandt et al. 2005 ). H. pylori is divided into cagA -positive and cagA -negative strains, and there is increasing evidence that infection with strains containing a cagA gene are associated with a greater inflammatory response and an increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes than infections with strains lacking the cagA gene in Western countries ( Blaser et al. 1995 ; Yamaoka et al. 2006 ; Yamaoka et al. 2002 ). Interestingly, the prevalence of the cagA -positive strain differs among different countries, and more than 90% of H. pylori strains are cagA positive in East Asian countries, irrespective of clinical presentation ( Yamaoka et al. 2002 ). van der Hulst et al. ( van der Hulst et al. 1997 ) initially reported that cure of H. pylori infection was achieved in a significantly greater number of patients infected with cagA -positive H. pylori (73%, 89/122) compared with those with cagA -negative strains (52%, 17/33; p=0.017; Table 2 ). There were many subsequent studies; eight (50.0%) out of 16 studies supported the original hypothesis and the remaining studies showed that cagA status was independent of the cure rate. There is no contradictory study showing increased failure risk of eradication therapy in cagA -positive strains. As summarized in Table 2 , each eradication regimen used different PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and pantoprazole) and/or antibiotics (clarithromycin, amoxicillin, metronidazole, and tinidazole) and the duration of the treatment also varied from 3 to 14 days. However, there is no significant difference in the overall cure rates (combined cagA -positive and -negative) among the different studies listed in Table 2 ; we therefore combined the data for analysis. As a result, the cure rates in patients infected with cagA -positive strains were 83.1% (95% CI: 80.7–85.3%; 876/1054) and those with cagA -negative strains 69.9% (95% CI: 65.7–73.9%; 349/499), supporting the original hypothesis that cure rates are significantly lower in cagA -negative patients than in cagA -positive patients (p<0.01). Suzuki et al. ( Suzuki et al. 2006 ) also reported that in a meta-analysis, the risk ratio for eradication failure in patients with cagA -negative strain (cure rate: 84%) relative to cagA -positive (73%) was 2.0 (95% CI: 1.6–2.4, p<0.01) and that cagA status and a high proportion of patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia were factors for heterogeneity among studies. From a biological point, the relationship between the success or failure of H. pylori eradication therapy and cagA status has been explained by the enhanced gastric mucosal inflammation. A good correlation between cagA positivity and severe gastric inflammation has been confirmed ( De Francesco et al. 2004 ; van der Hulst et al. 1997 ). Patients with severe inflammatory cell infiltrations in the antral mucosa were associated with significantly higher cure rates compared with those with milder inflammation ( Zanten et al. 1999 ). Since gastric inflammation increases mucosal blood blow, it has been hypothesized that the increased blood flow may help the diffusion of antibiotics ( Maeda et al. 1999 ). As another mechanism, cagA -positive strains are reported to grow faster than cagA -negative strains ( Censini et al. 1996 ; van Doorn et al. 2000 ). Since antibiotics are active during cell division, they are more active on rapidly growing bacteria than on bacteria in resting phase. We also hypothesize that pro-inflammatory cytokine levels should play a role in the cure rates of H. pylori infection. As discussed above, IL-1? is a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion ( Kondo et al. 1994 ; Wolfe and Nompleggi 1992 ) and the increased production of IL-1? in the gastric mucosa in response to H. pylori infection would result in an enhanced suppression of gastric acid secretion ( Furuta et al. 2002a ; Furuta et al. 2002b ; Takashima et al. 2001 ; Wang et al. 1999 ). The cagA -positive strains produce significantly higher IL-1? in gastric mucosa compared with cagA -negative strains ( Yamaoka et al. 1996 ; Yamaoka et al. 1999 ). To obtain a higher cure rate, gastric acid secretion should be potently inhibited during treatment and, thus, cagA -negative strains, which produce less IL-1?, would be less accessible to antibiotics and therefore it would be more difficult to cure H. pylori infection. High H. pylori density in the gastric mucosa and the existence of intestinal metaplasia are reported to decrease cure rates, while a severe neutrophil infiltration is associated with significantly higher cure rates ( Zhao et al. 2007 ). The higher H. pylori density in the antral mucosa enhances antral inflammation and causes lower somatostatin expression. Therefore, gastrin secretion is increased, followed by potent acid secretion, leading to the development of duodenal ulcer ( Atherton et al. 1996 ). In general, it is well known that intestinal metaplasia has a decreased ability of acid secretion due to atrophic change in the corpus mucosa. Therefore, presence of metaplasia with atrophic change is considered to be a protective factor of eradication failure. In addition, cagA -positive stains are reported to be involved in the development of gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia ( Scholte et al. 2002 ). However, Zhao et al. ( Zhao et al. 2007 ) reported that intestinal metaplasia could decrease the cure rates of H. pylori infection and speculated that intestinal metaplasia forms a micro-environment; thus it may cause a drop in H. pylori cure rates. Since there is currently only one report investigating the relationship between gastric atrophy/intestinal metaplasia and cure rates ( Zhao et al. 2007 ), further studies will be required to verify the original reports. The prevalence of cagA -positive strains differs between East Asian and Western countries. In the studies listed in Table 2 , the prevalence of cagA -positive strains is significantly higher in East Asian countries (87.9%, 58/66) than in European countries (64.9%, 848/1306; p<0.01). Accordingly, the cure rates in East Asian countries (86.3%, 57/66) are also significantly higher than in European countries (80.3%, 1049/1306; p<0.01; Table 2 ). To confirm the findings, further studies will be necessary to investigate whether the differences in cure rates among different geographic populations is explained by the prevalence of cagA status.  vacA genotypes and H. pylori eradication therapy A single chromosomal copy of the vacA gene is present in essentially all H. pylori strains ( Cover et al. 1994 ). H. pylori VacA is a potent toxin that is secreted into the extracellular space by a type V autotransporter mechanism. Gastric epithelial cell injury is caused by a vacuolating cytotoxin encoded by the vacA gene which induces host cell vacuolation and ultimately cell death. Specific allele variations of vacA exhibit different levels of toxin activity and are associated with different risks of gastrointestinal diseases. The signal (s) region of the vacA gene encodes part of the cytotoxin’s signal peptide and N-terminus, while the middle (m) region encodes part of the 55 K C-terminal subunit. Two types of signal region (s1 and s2) and middle region (m1 and m2) exist and these cause differences in vacuolating activities among individual H. pylori strains ( Atherton et al. 1995 ). The vacA s2 type encodes a shorter extension of the N-terminal peptide on the mature protein, which blocks the vacuolating activity ( Letley and Atherton 2000 ). Conversely, infection with strains of the vacA s1 geno-type has been linked to severe gastric inflammation and duodenal ulcer with enhanced cytotoxin activity. In general, vacA s1 and m1 genotypes produce a large amount of toxin and induce higher vacuolating activity in gastric epithelial cells, whereas s2 and m2 genotypes produce little or no toxin ( Atherton et al. 1995 ; Letley and Atherton 2000 ). Accordingly, vacA s2–m2 strains are reported to be rarely associated with the development of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer ( Atherton et al. 1995 ). Several authors reported a relationship between vacA genotype and cure rates of H. pylori infection ( Table 2 ). Three (37.5%) out of eight previous studies demonstrated significant increased risk of H. pylori eradication failure in H. pylori with vacA s2 genotype compared with s1 genotype ( Table 2 ). On the other hand, there is only one study reporting a significant increased risk of eradication failure in H. pylori with vacA m1 genotype compared with m2 genotype. Similarly to cagA status, each regimen used different PPIs and/or antibiotics with different duration of treatment ( Table 3 ). However, there is no significant difference in the overall cure rates among the different studies listed in Table 3 . Overall, the cure rate in patients infected with the vacA s1 genotypes is 79.2% (95% CI: 75.1–83.0%; 336/424) and with the vacA s2 genotype 72.1% (95% CI: 64.8–78.7%; 124/172; p<0.01). In contrast, the cure rate in patients infected with the vacA m1 genotype is 82.7% (95% CI: 75.1–88.7%; 110/133) and with the vacA m2 genotype 82.3% (95%CI: 75.8–87.6%; 144/175, p=0.92). These results are reasonable since clinical isolates that contain the cagA gene typically also have vacA s1 genotypes ( Yamaoka et al. 2002 ), confirming that highly virulent strains are related to high cure rates. Recently, a third polymorphic determinant of vacuolating activity has been described as located between the s-region and m-region, an intermediate (i) region ( Rhead et al. 2007 ). Recent studies showed that patients infected with vacA i1 strains were closely associated with the development of gastric cancer in Iranian and Italian populations and of gastric ulcer in Iraqi and Italian populations ( Basso et al. 2008 ; Hussein et al. 2008 ; Rhead et al. 2007 ). However, there is currently no report about an association between vacA i-region genotype and eradication therapy.  Other virulence factors and H. pylori eradication therapy Approximately 4% of the H. pylori genome is predicted to encode outer membrane proteins, which may function as adhesins and contribute to pathogenesis. One such outer membrane protein is outer inflammatory protein (OipA). The functional status of the oipA gene is regulated by the slipped strand repairing based on the number of CT dinucleotide repeats in the 5’ region of the gene ( Kudo et al. 2004 ; Yamaoka et al. 2002 ; Yamaoka et al. 2000 ). OipA is identified as a proinflammatory response-inducing protein given that oipA mutants reduced induction of IL-8 from gastric epithelial cells ( Yamaoka et al. 2000 ). Functional OipA status is reported to be an independent determinant predictor of duodenal ulcer and is associated with high H. pylori density and severe neutrophil concentration ( Yamaoka et al. 2002 ). Importantly, oipA functional status has been strongly correlated with the cagA -positive and vacA s1 genotype ( Yamaoka et al. 2002 ), suggesting that oipA functional status should be related to higher cure rates. Since OipA is function as an adhesin ( Dossumbekova et al. 2006 ; Yamaoka et al. 2002 ; Yamaoka et al. 2004 ), oipA “on” strains are expected to attach more tightly to the gastric mucosa and to be exposed to the effects of antibiotics more strongly than oipA “off” strains. Surprisingly, however, Treiber et al. (2002) reported that patients infected with oipA “off” strains (94%, 154/163) have higher cure rates compared with oipA “on” strains (87%, 78/88; p<0.05) when using the combination of lansoprazole or rabeprazole, ampicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole for three or five days. Since there is currently only one study investigating OipA status in eradication therapy, future studies will be necessary to investigate the relationship between OipA status and cure rates.  ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE VIRULENCE TYPE OF <italic>H. PYLORI</italic> AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO ANTIBIOTICS There are several papers which reported a relationship between H. pylori antibiotic resistance patterns and virulence factor genotypes. Elviss et al. ( Elviss et al. 2004 ) reported that susceptible isolates to clarithromycin and metronidazole were strongly associated with the vacA s1m2 genotype, but not with either the high-virulence vacA s1m1 genotype or low-virulence vacA s2m2genotype. However, in other papers such an association between the virulence type of H. pylori and susceptibility to antibiotics was not reported when the MIC values for metronidazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, tetracycline, and furazolidone were compared with the different vacA , iceA , cagA , and cagE genotypes ( Elviss et al. 2005 ; Godoy et al. 2003 ; Loivukene et al. 2000 ).  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION H. pylori resistance to antibiotics, insufficient acid inhibition, and H. pylori virulence factors are the prognostic markers of success or failure of H. pylori eradication therapy and can be determined by certain tests in advance of treatment. Therefore a tailored regimen based on pretreatment tests may be preferable for the achievement of higher cure rates (i.e. a grade A level). Recently, pharmacogenomics-based tailored treatment can increase the cure rates by the first-line treatment (e.g. CYP2C19-based optimization of PPI doses) ( Furuta et al. 2007 ). In this review we also confirmed that cagA status and vacA genotypes of H. pylori are involved in cure rates; therefore, tailored treatment should take account of not only antibiotic resistance and CYP2C19 genotype, but also H. pylori virulence factors. In particular, in patients infected with low-virulence strains with cagA -negative and vacA s2 genotype, potent acid inhibition using increased doses of PPIs and/or H2RA will be necessary for the success of eradication therapy. To achieve cure rates of grade A, we recommend eradicating H. pylori infection as follows: first, physicians should check the susceptibility of H. pylori to antimicrobial agents before the treatment by culture and/or genetic testing and try to use antibiotics with sensitivity to H. pylori . Second, physicians should maintain a higher pH in the stomach in which the selected antibacterial agents become more stable and bioavailable by prescribing a frequent PPI dosage or combined dosage of PPI and H2RA for patients who are refractory to standard PPI therapy. The dosing scheme of acid-inhibitory drugs should be optimized for each patient. Third, physicians should consider the polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporter genes, such as CYP2C19 and MDR1 genotypes. Finally, physicians should also check the H. pylori virulence factors cagA and/or vacA . When the H. pylori has low-virulence strains of cagA -negative and/or vacA s2 genotype, potent acid inhibition will be required for the cure of H. pylori infection. Unfortunately, the above antimicrobial susceptibility test and genomic analyses for host genetics and virulence factors of H. pylori are not currently practical since only a few laboratories are prepared to provide the services required. However, since there are currently no definite successful regimens to achieve cure rates of grade A, a microbiological and pharmacogenomics-based tailored regimen which selects both the PPI-dosing schedule and the antibiotics according to the above-mentioned items is expected to be significantly more effective than that with the standard in the near future and all over the world. However, before performing genotyping tests on host polymorphism and virulence factors, an analysis of cost effectiveness should be performed. Furuta et al. ( Furuta et al. 2007 ) reported that the mean costs for successful cure of H. pylori per patient among a standard regimen group were almost the same as among a pharmacogenomics-based regimen group. Therefore, the pharmacogenomics-based strategy seems to be worth performing in advance since the cost of performing genotyping tests could be offset by several merits obtained from the higher cure rates by the pharmacogenomics-based treatment ( Furuta et al. 2007 ). However, if we combine several genotyping tests on host polymorphism and virulence factors, a high cost should be required and further studies will be necessary to investigate a more detailed cost-benefit analysis.
