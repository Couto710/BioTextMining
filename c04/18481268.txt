Expression and Sub-Cellular Localization of the CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein ? in Relation to Postnatal Development and Malignancy of the Prostate BACKGROUND C/EBP? is a critical mediator of terminal differentiation and a tumor suppressor through its strong antiproliferative actions on cell cycle regulatory proteins. C/EBP? also appears to regulate androgen receptor (AR) AR signaling. There, is a paucity of information on the expression and sub-cellular localization of C/EBP? in normal mouse and human prostate and in prostate cancer. METHODS Immunohistochemistry of tissues including tissue arrays, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and mRNA expression database mining. RESULTS In the mouse prostate epithelium, C/EBP? was present at 1 week postnatal localized in the cytosol, began to show nuclear localization at 8 weeks and continued to show prominent nuclear expression at 10 weeks and beyond; C/EBP? mRNA was expressed at all ages. In humans, C/EBP? showed prominent nuclear localization from peripubescence up to middle age but was sequestered in the cytosol in older individuals; the mRNA level for C/EBP? remained essentially unchanged. Most prostate adenocarcinomas expressed a range of levels of C/EBP? mRNA and protein that were relatively high in metastatic tumors in a manner that correlated with AR expression; however, most cells showed C/EBP? sequestered in the cytosol. CONCLUSIONS Temporal changes in sub-cellular localization of C/EBP? are consistent with a role in prostate differentiation and as a prostate tumor suppressor; the cytoplasmic sequestration of C/EBP?, unique to older human prostates, is arguably a permissive condition for the greater frequency of proliferative disorders of the prostate. In malignant prostate C/EBP? may be available to regulate AR signaling through transient changes in its sub-cellular localization.  INTRODUCTION The CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family comprises at least six members, named ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, and ? [ 1 ]. They are homo- or hetero-dimeric basic/leucine zipper transcription factors that recognize the CCAAT enhancer, a divergent dyad repeat sequence RTTGCGYAAY, in which R and Y represent A/G and C/T respectively [ 2 ]. Members of the C/EBP family are required for the differentiation of adipocytes, myeloid cells, hepatocytes and other cell types [ 1 ]. Among C/EBP proteins, C/EBP? is distinctive in that in addition to its transcriptional activity, it inhibits cell proliferation by several non-genomic mechanisms [ 3 – 5 ]. C/EBP? can exert its antiproliferative actions without binding to DNA [ 6 ] through protein–protein interactions; they include stabilization of p21 [ 7 , 8 ], disruption of E2F complexes [ 9 – 11 ], inhibition/degradation of cdk2 and cdk4 [ 12 , 13 ] and interaction with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex [ 14 ]. The antiproliferative actions of C/EBP? cause it to be a tumor suppressor in several cell types such as acute myeloid leukemia, lung cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, and skin cancer [ 5 , 15 – 21 ]. However, in liver tumors, dephosphorylation of C/EBP? by activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway inhibits its interactions with cdk2 and E2F complexes [ 22 ]; dephosphorylated C/EBP? may contribute to proliferation by sequestering Rb [ 23 ]. Since C/EBP? is also frequently expressed in malignant tissues (Ref. [ 24 ] and Oncomine microarray data repository; http://www.oncomine.org/ ), an altered phosphorylation state could be expected to cause the protein to support tumor proliferation [ 23 ]. There is some evidence that in both humans and rodents, C/EBP? is expressed in prostate epithelial cells [ 25 , 26 ] and DNA microarray data indicates the presence of mRNA for C/EBP? in malignant human prostate tissue [ 27 ]. C/EBP? has also been reported to associate with the androgen receptor (AR) [ 26 ] suggesting a role in regulating AR signaling. Ectopic C/EBP? was antiproliferative in C/EBP?-negative prostate cancer cells. Since C/EBP? could thus play a role in normal prostate development and also in the physiology of prostate tumors, there is currently a need for a systematic investigation of its regulation during various stages of the development of the normal human and mouse prostates and in a spectrum of prostate tumors. This study reveals unique and physiologically significant aspects of C/EBP? expression in prostate tissues.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Immunohistochemistry of Mouse and Human Prostate Tissues Black/6 mice were euthanized at specific ages ranging from 1 week to 8 months. The prostates were dissected immediately after euthanasia and fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained for C/EBP? using standard procedures. Briefly, antibody to C/EBP? (sc-61, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was titrated on normal mouse prostate. Rat and mouse liver were used as positive controls. Unstained sections were microwaved for 30 sec in citrate buffer before incubation for 4 hr at room temperature with the optimal dilution of antibody (2 µg/ml). A biotinolyated secondary antibody was applied for 30 min. Specific staining was revealed using a standard kit according to the manufacturer’s directions (Biogenex). Normal human prostates were obtained from autopsy and were frozen at ?80°C. Frozen sections were stained as described for formalin fixed tissue. Formalin fixed tissues were also used in the staining of human prostates. The specificity of sc-61 antibody for C/EBP? was confirmed using HeLa cells transfected with an expression plasmid for C/EBP? (data not shown). In all cases, a non-immune rabbit IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) (negative control) was non-reactive. Isolation of RNA From Mouse and Human Prostate Prostate tissues from mice of various age groups were dissected immediately following euthanasia of the mice and homogenized in TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen) using a TissueMiser (Fisher). Total RNA was isolated from the tissue homogenates following the manufacturer’s protocol for TRIZOL Reagent. Total RNA was similarly isolated after pulverizing frozen human prostate tissue. Control adult human liver RNA was purchased from Ambion (Foster City, CA). Real Time-Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (Real Time-RT-PCR) Analysis Reverse transcription followed by quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the endogenous mRNA levels for mouse or human C/EBP? and for mouse or human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (control). Total RNA (1 µg per sample) was reverse transcribed with random primers using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturers’ protocol. The reverse transcription product was subjected to quantitative real-time PCR using the Real-Time PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) in the 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Primers and TaqMan probe for mouse and human C/EBP? and for human GAPDH were obtained from Applied Biosystems. The mRNA for mouse GAPDH was measured using the Syber Green I nucleic acid gel stain from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen detection technologies). Fluorescence data generated were monitored and recorded on a 7500 Real-Time PCR sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). All samples were measured in triplicate and the values normalized to the corresponding GAPDH values. As a negative control, the Real Time PCR master mix was used without any template added during the reverse transcription step of the quantitative real time RT-PCR assays. The results are presented as mean ± SE. Tissue Array Analysis Replicate prostate normal and cancer tissue array slides (#PR802, #PR952, and #BC19111) were purchased from US Biomax, Inc. (Rockville, MD). The arrays were probed with primary rabbit antibody to either C/EBP? (SC-61, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or to AR (SC-816, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or with normal rabbit IgG (negative control). Antigen retrieval was performed using Target Retrieval Solution (S1699) from DAKO. Sections were incubated for 30 min with ready-to-use (2.5%) normal horse blocking serum. They were then incubated with primary antibodies (2 µg/ml) for 1h at room temperature. After washing, the slides were incubated for 30 min with ImPRESS Reagent (peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, MP7407 from Vector Laboratories). The sections were then washed and incubated for 5 min with peroxidase substrate (DAB, K3466 from DAKO Cytomation). After rinsing with tap water, the slides were counterstained with Hematoxilin QS (H-3404, Vector Laboratories). A duplicate set of slides were treated as above but without counterstaining. Twenty times object images were scanned for each slide.  Immunohistochemistry of Mouse and Human Prostate Tissues Black/6 mice were euthanized at specific ages ranging from 1 week to 8 months.

During the Development of the Mouse Prostate The temporal sequence of C/EBP? expression in the developing mouse prostate was examined by immunohistochemical staining ( Fig. 1 ). C/EBP? was expressed throughout the cytoplasm of the prostate epithelial cells as early as 1 week; cytoplasmic expression remained strong and diffuse up to 6 weeks of age. At 8 weeks of age, C/EBP? was expressed diffusely in both the cytoplasm and in most nuclei of the prostate epithelium; strong, uniform expression of C/EBP? in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of the prostate epithelium persisted at 16 weeks. By 8 months, expression of C/EBP? was still diffuse in the cytoplasm and prominent but not complete in the nuclei. The expression of C/EBP? in the liver of the adult mouse remained relatively high and was also nuclear (data not shown). The mRNA level for C/EBP? remained relatively constant throughout the development of the mouse prostate (1–12 weeks) and was significantly lower (~1/30) compared to the level of C/EBP?mRNAin the adult mouse liver ( Fig. 2 ); this may be at least partially accounted for by the fact that there is a greater proportion of C/EBP?-negative interstitial tissue in the prostate. The C/EBP? mRNA decreased modestly in older (6 months and over) mice ( Fig. 2 ). Expression of C/EBP? in the Normal Human Prostate Figure 3 shows representative examples of the expression of C/EBP? in the normal human prostate. There was strong diffuse staining of C/EBP? in the nucleus and cytoplasm of prostate epithelial cells at 16 years of age (peri-pubescent). Nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of C/EBP? remained unchanged at 27 and 29 years of age. By 49 years of age, there was some decline in nuclear expression of C/EBP?. Loss of nuclear staining became widespread by age 59, with C/EBP? expression observed in the cytoplasm. Cytosolic localization of C/EBP? in the prostates of older men, noted in Figure 3 , was further established by data that included tissue array analysis of normal prostate ( Table I ). The mRNA for C/EBP? was expressed in human prostate at a relatively higher level than mouse prostate, when measured in relation to liver (~30% of liver C/EBP? mRNA) ( Fig. 4 ); again, it may be noted that like the mouse prostate, the human prostate has a greater proportion of C/EBP?-negative interstitial tissue than liver. Expression of C/EBP? in Prostate Adenocarcinoma The expression of C/EBP? in prostate adenocarcinoma was examined together with that of AR by immunohistochemical analysis of a tumor tissue array containing diseased tissue from 78 patients. The patients ranged in age from 38 to 87 years and the tumor samples covered the entire range of tumor grade and Gleason scores. The signal intensities for both C/EBP? and AR were scored in arbitrary units in the range of 0 (absent) through 4 (highest). Representative results of for the staining of C/EBP? and AR together with negative controls are shown in Figure 5 . C/EBP? expression in the tumors was predominantly in the cytosol although some cells in the sections showed nuclear staining. A box plot analysis of the results showed that samples with higher AR scores (3 and 4) co-expressed significantly higher levels of C/EBP? ( Fig. 6A ). However, there was no significant correlation between the Gleason score and the expression level of either C/EBP? or AR (data plot not shown). To examine the relative mRNA levels for C/EBP? and AR in prostate adenocarcinoma samples from a large number of patients, DNA microarray data was mined from the largest single study of prostate tumors [ 27 ] through the Oncomine repository at: http:/www.oncomine.org/ and also through the public database at: http://pcabc.upmc.edu/data/pubviewdata.cfm?cc=pitt&acctype=pub&proj=director%27s%20-challenge%20for%20the%20molecular%20reclassification%20of%20prostate%20cancer . The box plot in Figure 6B shows an elevation in the mRNA for C/EBP? in prostate tumors relative to normal prostate. The box plot in Figure 6C indicates a significant elevation in AR mRNA in the more aggressive prostate tumors compared to non-aggressive tumors. Among the aggressive tumors, there was a significant positive correlation between the expression level of AR and that of C/EBP? (r=0.5111471) ( Fig. 6D ), consistent with immunohistochemical studies of tumor tissue arrays discussed above.  RESULTS Expression of C/EBP?

DISCUSSION C/EBP? gene knockout mice have been reported to die within hours after birth from hypoglycemia due to decreases in glycogen synthase and gluconeogenic enzymes in the liver [ 28 ]. This period precedes the time of maturation of the prostate but the expression of C/EBP? in the prostate suggests a role for it in prostate physiology. This study reveals features of C/EBP? expression that are distinctive in the normal human prostate in comparison to other normal human tissues or to the normal mouse prostate. The mouse prostate shows expression of C/EBP? protein and mRNA expression very early in its development but the protein is localized in the nuclear compartment, which is the site of its action, only at the onset of terminal differentiation; C/EBP? expression persists in the nuclear compartment in older mice. In the human prostate also, C/EBP? protein and mRNA expression was observed at all ages that were examined (from peri-pubescence through the 8th decade); however the protein was progressively sequestered in the cytosolic compartment in older men, in contrast to observations in the liver of older men [ 29 ] and adipose tissue in post-menopausal women [ 24 ], where C/EBP? occurred in the nucleus. It thus appears that in normal prostate tissues, C/EBP? is regulated through modulation of its intracellular localization. The temporal sequence of expression and nuclear import of C/EBP? is entirely consistent with a role in prostate differentiation since the nucleus, rather than the cytosol, is the known site of most if not all of the biological actions of C/EBP?, particularly its strong antiproliferative actions. It is also reasonable to suggest then, that the age-related sequestration of the protein in the cytosol of the prostate epithelium may contribute significantly to the permissive state of the human prostate to the relatively high frequency of proliferative disorders in older males [ 30 ]. In contrast to other tumor suppressors, C/EBP? was frequently highly expressed in prostate tumors. Here again, the largely cytosolic localization of the protein would account for its inability to exert its antiproliferative effect. A similar, largely cytosolic localization was reported for C/EBP? in epithelial ovarian tumors [ 24 ]. In malignant tissues, however, the continued expression of C/EBP? may reflect a long-term role for the protein. Notably, a small fraction of the tumor cells did show the protein localized in the nucleus at any given time, indicating that some of the transcriptional activities of the protein may be utilized by the proliferating cells at the appropriate times by regulating its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling. Indeed nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of major transcription factors, including members of the C/EBP family, is known to be regulated through signaling pathways [ 31 , 32 ]. The specific proliferative versus antiproliferative role of C/EBP? may be controlled by regulating nuclear-cytoplasmic transport in relation to cellular contexts such as the cell cycle stage. In this regard, a significant observation is the frequent co-expression of C/EBP? with AR in prostate cancer, particularly in the more aggressive/metastatic tumors. AR signaling is critical for the physiology of most prostate tumors even when the tumors are hormone refractory [ 33 ]. It has recently been reported that C/EBP? can physically associate with AR and influence gene transcription by AR, although the impact of this interaction on global gene expression profiles is yet to be analyzed [ 26 ]. The co-expression of the two interacting proteins, which are both major regulators of transcription, strongly suggests a combined role for them in determining the molecular phenotype of prostate tumors.  DISCUSSION C/EBP? gene knockout mice have been reported to die within hours after birth from hypoglycemia due to decreases in glycogen synthase and gluconeogenic enzymes in the liver [ 28 ]. This period precedes the time of maturation of the prostate but the expression of C/EBP? in the prostate suggests a role for it in prostate physiology. This study reveals features of C/EBP? expression that are distinctive in the normal human prostate in comparison to other normal human tissues or to the normal mouse prostate. The mouse prostate shows expression of C/EBP? protein and mRNA expression very early in its development but the protein is localized in the nuclear compartment, which is the site of its action, only at the onset of terminal differentiation; C/EBP? expression persists in the nuclear compartment in older mice. In the human prostate also, C/EBP? protein and mRNA expression was observed at all ages that were examined (from peri-pubescence through the 8th decade); however the protein was progressively sequestered in the cytosolic compartment in older men, in contrast to observations in the liver of older men [ 29 ] and adipose tissue in post-menopausal women [ 24 ], where C/EBP? occurred in the nucleus. It thus appears that in normal prostate tissues, C/EBP? is regulated through modulation of its intracellular localization. The temporal sequence of expression and nuclear import of C/EBP? is entirely consistent with a role in prostate differentiation since the nucleus, rather than the cytosol, is the known site of most if not all of the biological actions of C/EBP?, particularly its strong antiproliferative actions. It is also reasonable to suggest then, that the age-related sequestration of the protein in the cytosol of the prostate epithelium may contribute significantly to the permissive state of the human prostate to the relatively high frequency of proliferative disorders in older males [ 30 ]. In contrast to other tumor suppressors, C/EBP? was frequently highly expressed in prostate tumors. Here again, the largely cytosolic localization of the protein would account for its inability to exert its antiproliferative effect. A similar, largely cytosolic localization was reported for C/EBP? in epithelial ovarian tumors [ 24 ]. In malignant tissues, however, the continued expression of C/EBP? may reflect a long-term role for the protein. Notably, a small fraction of the tumor cells did show the protein localized in the nucleus at any given time, indicating that some of the transcriptional activities of the protein may be utilized by the proliferating cells at the appropriate times by regulating its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling. Indeed nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of major transcription factors, including members of the C/EBP family, is known to be regulated through signaling pathways [ 31 , 32 ]. The specific proliferative versus antiproliferative role of C/EBP? may be controlled by regulating nuclear-cytoplasmic transport in relation to cellular contexts such as the cell cycle stage. In this regard, a significant observation is the frequent co-expression of C/EBP? with AR in prostate cancer, particularly in the more aggressive/metastatic tumors. AR signaling is critical for the physiology of most prostate tumors even when the tumors are hormone refractory [ 33 ]. It has recently been reported that C/EBP? can physically associate with AR and influence gene transcription by AR, although the impact of this interaction on global gene expression profiles is yet to be analyzed [ 26 ]. The co-expression of the two interacting proteins, which are both major regulators of transcription, strongly suggests a combined role for them in determining the molecular phenotype of prostate tumors.
