Reduction in incident stroke risk with vigorous physical activity. Evidence from 7.7-year follow-up of the National Runners’ Health Study Background and Purpose To assess the dose-response relationship between vigorous physical activity (running distance, km/day) and the participant-reported physician-diagnosed stroke. Methods Age-adjusted survival analysis of 29,272 men and 12,123 women followed prospectively for 7.7 years. Results One-hundred men and 19 women reported incident strokes. Per km/day run, the age- and smoking-adjusted risk for stroke decreased 12% in men (P=0.0007), and 11% in men and women combined (P=0.001), which remained significant when further adjusted for baseline diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and BMI (8% and 7% reduction per km/day run, respectively, P=0.03). Men and women who exceed 2 km/day (i.e., exceed the recommended AHA/CDC and NIH guideline activity level) had significantly lower risk than those that ran less (P=0.05) and those that ran >4 km/day had significantly lower risk than those that ran 2–4 km/day (P=0.02). Men and women who ran >8 km/day were at 60% lower risk than those who ran <2 km/day (P=0.002). Conclusions The risk for incident stroke is substantially reduced in those who exceed the guideline physical activity level, which cannot be attributed to less hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or body weight.
