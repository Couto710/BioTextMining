Sumoylation and Human Disease Pathogenesis Covalent modification by SUMO polypeptides, or sumoylation, is an important regulator of the functional properties of many proteins. Among these are a number of proteins implicated in human diseases, including cancer, Huntington’s, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s Diseases, as well as spinocerebellar ataxia 1 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent reports reveal two new examples of human disease-associated proteins that are SUMO modified: amyloid precursor protein and lamin A. These findings point to a function for sumoylation in modulating A? peptide levels, suggesting a potential role in Alzheimer’s Disease, and for decreased lamin A sumoylation as a causative factor in familial dilated cardiomyopathy.
