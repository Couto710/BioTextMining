Sensitivity to the non-COX inhibiting celecoxib derivative, OSU03012, is p21 WAF1/CIP1 dependent OSU03012 is a non-COX inhibiting celecoxib derivative with growth inhibiting and apoptotic activity in many cancer cell lines. To investigate mechanisms related to cell cycle proteins in growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by OSU03012, the primary human oral epithelial cell line, TE1177, was transformed with HPV16 E6 (TE/E6), HPV16 E7 (TE/E7) or empty vector (TE/V). TE/E6 cell lines exhibiting low levels of p53 and undetectable levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 were sensitized to the growth inhibiting and apoptotic effects of OSU03012. The TE/E7 cell lines expressing low levels of Rb and elevated levels of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 were resistant. OSU03012 reduced the number of cells in the S phase of the TE/E7 and TE/V cell lines with intact p53-p21WAF1/CIP1 checkpoint, but not in the checkpoint defective TE/E6 cell lines. Treatment with OSU03012 also markedly reduced the levels of cyclin A and Cdk2 in TE/E7 and TE/V, but not in TE/E6 cell lines, which had significantly enhanced basal levels of cyclin A and Cdk2. Consistent with the TE/E6 cell line, p21WAF1/CIP1?/? mouse embryo fibroblasts were more sensitive to OSU03012-induced apoptosis as evidenced by PARP and caspase 3 cleavages. These data suggest that p21WAF1/CIP1 is an important factor in the sensitivity of cells to the growth inhibiting and apoptotic effects of OSU03012.  Introduction OSU03012 is a celecoxib derivative, which has shown potent anticancer activity in panel of cancer cell lines including prostate, lung cancer, breast cancer, colon, leukemia. 1 - 7 Recent studies have also shown that OSU03012 has cancer preventive effect in prostate cancer and enhanced the effect of tamoxifen in xenograft breast cancer in mouse models. 8 ; 9 Putative targets include: phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1/Akt pathway, p21-activated kinases, heat shock protein 70, signal transducers and activators of transcriptions 3, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. 10 , 11 , 12 ; 13 As a potential anticancer drug, further preclinical studies are required to better understand its biological mechanisms especially using primary normal cell lines. Cell proliferation is controlled by cell cycle regulatory proteins, which are frequently dysregulated in cancer cells. 14 ; 15 In this respect, several molecular changes have been identified in human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), such as p53, 16 ; 17 p21WAF1/CIP1, 18 ; 19 and cyclin D1. 20 p53, an important checkpoint protein, helps to regulate cell cycle progression at least in part via its downstream effector p21WAF1/CIP1. p21WAF1/CIP1 in turn directly inhibits cyclin/Cdk complexes to negatively regulate both G1 and G2 phase progression. 21 In response to certain types of cellular stress, p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 are activated, which inhibits the cyclin/Cdk complexes leading to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S and/or G2 checkpoints. 22 While these checkpoints are important in maintaining genomic integrity, they may also affect the sensitivity of tumor cells to therapeutic agents. Studies have shown that tumor cells losing checkpoint proteins become more sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs. 23 ; 24 Loss of the G1 checkpoint which allows more tumor cells to accumulate in the S phase may provide increased sensitivity to S phase specific drugs. 23 To further investigate the role of the expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 in growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by OSU03012 we used: i) the primary human oral epithelial cell line, TE1177, transformed with HPV16 E6 (TE/E6); and ii) p21WAF1/CIP1?/? mouse embryo fibroblasts. The data suggests that p21WAF1/CIP1 may be an important factor in the sensitivity of cells to OSU03012.  Material and methods Reagents OSU03012 was described previously. 1 ; 25 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide was purchased from Sigma chemical Co.(St Louis, MO). Cell lines The characteristics of the primary human oral epithelial cells (TE1177) were described previously. 16 ; 26 - 28 Cells were maintained at 37°C in an alpha modified MEM supplemented with epithelial growth factor, insulin, transferrin, hydrocortisone and 10% FBS. TE1177 cells were infected with retrovirus containing human papillomavirus (HPV)16 E6 (TE/E6), HPV16 E7 (TE/E7) or empty vectors (TE/V) and selected by hygromycin B. Empty vector RVY, RVY/HPV16 E6 and RVY/HPV16 E7 were kind gifts from Dr. DiMaio (Yale University School of Medicine, CT, USA). 29 Two E6- and seven E7-transformed cell lines were established and exhibit a greatly expanded life span in culture. These clones were maintained in the same medium as the parent cell line. Cell lines infected with empty vector have a finite life span similar to the primary parent TE1177 cell line. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21?/? JR), and control cells (wild type 129) were generous gifts from Dr. C.J. Sherr (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, TN, USA) and were cultured with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, ?-Mercaptoethanol (final concentration 55 ?M) and gentamycin at 37°C in a 9% CO2 incubator. Growth inhibition assay To estimate cell proliferation, cells were seeded (3×103) into 96-well plates in 100 ?l of growth medium as previously described. 30 After culture for 24 hr, cells were incubated with OSU03012 for 72 hr. Cells were washed in PBS three times, fixed in methanol:acetyl acid (3:1) for 1 hr, followed by staining with methylene blue for 1 hr. The plates were then rinsed in cold water, and a 100 ?l solution containing 40% methanol, 10% acetyl acid was added. Absorbance was measured at 660 nm. Flow cytometry analyses Cells were treated at 70% confluency. At the end of the treatment, cells were harvested with trypsin, fixed in 70% ethanol and stored at ?20°C as previously described. 31 Prior to FACS analyses the fixed cells were washed with PBS and incubated with a solution containing 33 ?g/ml propidium iodide, 0.2% NP-40 and 7,000 U/ml RNase A for 30 min in the dark. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using a Beckman-Coulter EPICS Elite flow cytometer equipped with a 488nm 15mW air-cooled Argon laser (Analytical Cytometry Laboratory of the OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center). At least 30,000 events were analyzed. Multicycle DNA modeling and Modfit software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME) were used to calculate the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle using coefficient of variance and chi square values to measure the goodness of fit. From this, histograms were generated which indicate the relative abundance of cell populations in subG0, G0/G1, S and G2/M phases. Western blot analysis Following treatment of cells, proteins were harvested as previously described 31 with the following modifications. Cells were lysed in a SDS buffer containing: 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% Glycerol. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Equal amounts (30?50 ?g) of protein were subjected to gel electrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide slab gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in the presence of SDS. The protein was electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and dried. The membrane was pre-incubated with blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk, 500 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris and 0.1% Tween-20) and then incubated with primary antibody at room temperature for one hour. The blot was probed with primary antibody specific for the following proteins: PARP (Asp214, 19F4, 1:1000), caspase 3 (Asp175, 1:1000), Rb (4H1, 1:1000), cyclin E (HE12, 1:1000), Cdk4 (DCS156, 1:1000), Cdk6 (DCS83, 1:1000), and p27kip1 (1:250) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA; cyclin A (H432, 1:1000), cyclin D1 (DCS-6, 1:500), Cdk 2 (M2, 1:2000), p53 (1801, 1:500), and p21WAF1/CIP1 (C-19, 1:500) were ordered from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa, CA; and ?-tubulin (Ab-1, 1:1000) was obtained from Oncogene Research Products, Darmstadt, Germany. After washing the membrane three times with TBS-T (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20) for 10 min, the membrane was incubated with mouse, rabbit or goat secondary antibody labeled with Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) at room temperature for one hour. Western blots were developed using a chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The membrane was then exposed to x-ray film. ?-Tubulin was detected on the same membrane and used as a loading control. Immunoprecipitation and kinase assay Cellular protein was extracted in NP-40 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaF, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM NaVO3, 1 mM PNSF, 1 mM DTT, and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail) for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The freshly extracted protein (500 ?g) was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C with rotation using 2 ?g anti-Cdk2 (M2, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Then 20 ?l protein A/G beads was added and incubated for another 2 hr. The beads were collected at 735 ×g for 30 sec and washed in NP-40 lysis buffer three times, and twice in kinase buffer twice (20 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4). The beads were resuspended in 20 ?l kinase buffer containing 100 ?M ATP (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA) and 2 ?g recombinant C-terminal fragment of retinoblastoma protein comprising amino acids 773?928 (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA). The beads were then incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The kinase reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of 2x sample buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 4% beta-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromophenol blue). Equal amounts (30 ?l) of protein were loaded and subjected to SDS PAGE. The blots were probed with anti-Rb Ser805/811 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), cyclin A (H-432, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and p21WAF1/CIP1 (C-19, 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). BrdU DNA incorporation assay BrdU incorporation was measured as described previously as an indicator of the number of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle 31 . Briefly, cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 3,000 cells/well. On the following day OSU03012 or solvent DMSO was added and incubated for 12 or 24 hr. BrdU was added and incubated with the cells for the final 3 hr. Following immunological detection of incorporated BrdU, fluorescence was read at 320 nm (excitation) and 420 nm (emission). Another parallel plate was not incubated with BrdU, but instead stained with methylene blue to measure relative cell numbers. This was used to normalize the amount of BrdU incorporated by relative cell number. The fold change in the level of BrdU incorporated was calculated by dividing the relative fluorescent units (RFU) of BrdU incorporated following OSU03012 treatment by the matched DMSO controls. Statistical analysis Each experiment was performed at least three times. Where appropriate, the data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (sem) and were analyzed for significance using student t-test. A p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Results OSU03012 increases the number of normal oral human epithelial cells in the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle Figure 1 shows that, 85.3% of the normal human oral epithelial cells in line TE1177 were in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Upon treatment with OSU03012, the number of cells in the G1 phase increases in a concentration dependent manner to 97.3% and 91.28% at 5 ?M for 24 and 48 hr, respectively. Less than 3% of the cells were found in the S phase. These data are in contrast to OSU03012 markedly increasing the number cells in the S phase of the premalignant and malignant cell lines. 32 This suggests that OSU03012 may be targeting proteins regulating the progression through the cell cycle. OSU03012 increases the levels of p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> reducing the activity of cyclin A/Cdk2 complex The progression of cells from the G1 into the S phase is highly dependent on activity of the Cdk2/cyclin A/p21 WAF1/CIP1 complex. As shown in Figure 2A and B , the levels of Cdk2 and cyclin A were significantly reduced, while the kinase suppressor p21WAF1/CIP1 was significantly increased following treatment of the normal oral cell line with OSU03012. The reduced activity of the cyclin A/Cdk2 complex was confirmed by: i) the reduction in BrdU incorporation, an indicator of DNA synthesis ( Fig. 2C ); and ii) the lack of phosphorylation of recombinant Rb at Ser 807/811 ( Fig. 2D ). We next determined whether the induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 and its binding to the Cdk2/cyclin A complex contributes to the inactivation of Cdk2. 21 The Cdk2/cyclin A/ p21WAF1/CIP1 complex was immunoprecipitated with Cdk2 antibody, and then probed using anti-p21WAF1/CIP1 and anti-cyclin A antibodies. Figure 2D shows that p21WAF1/CIP1 and cyclin A were both immunoprecipitated by the Cdk2 antibody. Consistent with Figure 2A , the levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 markedly increased, while cyclin A decreased following treatment with OSU03012. These data suggest that the increased levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 in the normal cell line provide more opportunity for binding to the complex and inactivating cyclin A/Cdk2. Transformation of the normal oral cell line with E6 leads to loss of p53-p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> checkpoint and increased sensitivity to OSU03012 Upon treatment with OSU03012, the normal human oral epithelial cell line TE1177 showed a G1 arrest and resistant to apoptosis. Since normal cells have an intact G1/S checkpoint, we suspected that the p53-p21WAF1/CIP1 checkpoint or Rb pathway may affect the response of cells to treatment with OSU03012. To determine the role of the p53-p21WAF1/CIP1 checkpoint in OSU03012 cell sensitivity, the primary human epithelial cell line TE1177 was infected with retroviruses containing HPV16 E6. The role of Rb pathway was evaluated in HPV16 E7 infected cell lines. The HPV16 virus was used because of their significance in the development of HNSCC and the inference of E6 and E7 genes with cell cycle checkpoints. 33 ; 34 As expected, the resultant HPV16 E6 cell lines retain Rb and lost the p53-p21WAF1/CIP1 checkpoint exhibiting low levels of p53 and undetectable p21 ( Fig. 3A ). The HPV16 E7 cell lines exhibit greatly reduced levels of Rb and elevated levels of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 ( Fig. 3A ). The cell lines containing an empty vector were characteristic of the parent cell line. Transformation with HPV16 E6 resulting in the loss of p53-p21WAF1/CIP1 checkpoint significantly enhanced the sensitivity of the normal epithelial cell lines to growth inhibition by OSU03012, compared to the HPV16 E7 transformed, empty vector infected normal and the normal cell lines ( Fig. 3B ). The sensitivity of the E6 infected cell lines were due to apoptosis as indicated by the cleavage of PARP and caspase 3 ( Fig. 3C ). The parent, E7 and empty vector infected cell lines did not exhibit these indicators of apoptosis. E6-transformed normal oral cell lines have a larger S phase population prior to and post OSU03012 treatment The distribution of the E6 and E7 infected cells in cell cycle was investigated following OSU03012 treatment using flow cytometry ( Fig. 4 ). The empty vector infected TE1177 cells has a distribution similar to the parent TE1177 cell line. Infection with HPV16 E6 or HPV16 E7 reduced the population of cells in the G1 phase, increasing the number of cells in the S and G2/M phases. Following treatment with OSU03012, the empty vector infected TE1177 cells exhibited an increased G1 and reduced S phase populations similar to the parent TE1177 cells. OSU03012 treatment of HPV16 E6 infected cells did not alter the distribution of cells in the S phase. However, it decreased the number of cells (9.7 to 4.8%) in G2/M, while increasing cells (68.3 to 73.3%) in the G1 phase. In HPV16 E7 infected cells, treatment with OSU03012 led to a 25% reduction (18.1 to 13.5%) in the S phase population, with a concurrent increase (14.2 to 19.0%) in the G2/M population. Change in cell cycle proteins in transformed normal oral cell lines upon OSU03012 treatment The levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins and DNA synthesis were determined in the empty vector, E6 and E7 infected cell lines ( Fig. 5 ). Coinciding with the increased numbers of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, the levels of cyclin A and Cdk2 were increased, and p21WAF1/CIP1 was absent in the E6, compared to the empty vector cell lines ( Fig. 5A ). This corresponded to increased levels of DNA synthesis in the E6 cell line ( Fig. 5B ). In the E7 cell lines, where the increase in S phase cells is less than in E6 cells, the levels of cyclin A were similar, and Cdk2 and p21WAF1/CIP1 markedly increased compared to the parent cell line. While the levels of DNA synthesis in the E7 cell lines were higher than the empty vector, they were lower than the E6 cell lines. When the cell lines were treated with OSU03012, the levels of DNA synthesis, cyclin A and Cdk2 decreased in the empty vector and E7, and were not affected in the E6 cell lines. The levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 also increased in the empty vector, and remain elevated in the E7, but was absent in the E6 cell lines. These data suggest that a functional p21WAF1/CIP1, inhibiting the cyclin A/Cdk2 complex activity, protects cells from OSU03012 induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. G1 cell cycle proteins were investigated in empty vector, E6 or E7 infected normal cell lines. As shown in Figure 5C , OSU03012 increased the levels of cyclin E in E6- and E7-transformed normal cell lines. Cyclin D1 decreased in both E6- and E7-transformed cells, which is further reduced by OSU03012. E6-transformation enhanced Cdk4, whereas E7-transformation increased levels of Cdk6, both of which were slightly reduced by OSU03012. p27kip1 was increased by OSU03012 in E6-infected, but not in E7 or empty vector infected cell lines. Inactivation of p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> sensitizes cells to OSU03012 To further define the role of p21WAF1/CIP1 in sensitizing cells to OSU03012, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) deficient in p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21?/?), and wild type control cells were treated with OSU03012. Growth inhibition assays showed that the MEF p21 WAF1/CIP1?/? cell line was more sensitive than the wild type MEF cell line to OSU03012 ( Fig. 6A ). This growth inhibition pattern is similar to the E6-transformed normal human oral epithelial cell lines with undetectable levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 ( Fig. 3B ). We next investigated changes in G1 cell cycle proteins in MEF. OSU03012 decreased levels of cylin E, slightly increased levels of cyclin D1, Cdk4, and p27 in p21 WAF1/CIP1?/? MEF ( Fig. 5C ,). OSU03012 did not affect the levels of these proteins in p21 WAF1/CIP1?/? MEF. The protein levels of Cdk6 were very low in both p21+/+ and p21?/? MEF. The increase in p27 was similar to that observed in the E6 transformed human cell lines ( Fig. 5C ). Since p21 WAF1/CIP1?/? MEF are more sensitive to growth inhibition by OSU03012 ( Fig. 6A ), we further investigated whether apoptosis is involved. As shown in Fig. 6B , p21?/? MEF cells showed marked PARP and caspase 3 cleavages, further suggesting that the lack of p21WAF1/CIP1 sensitizes cells to OSU03012-induced apoptosis.  Results OSU03012 increases the number of normal oral human epithelial cells in the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle Figure 1 shows that, 85.3% of the normal human oral epithelial cells in line TE1177 were in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Upon treatment with OSU03012, the number of cells in the G1 phase increases in a concentration dependent manner to 97.3% and 91.28% at 5 ?M for 24 and 48 hr, respectively. Less than 3% of the cells were found in the S phase. These data are in contrast to OSU03012 markedly increasing the number cells in the S phase of the premalignant and malignant cell lines. 32 This suggests that OSU03012 may be targeting proteins regulating the progression through the cell cycle. OSU03012 increases the levels of p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> reducing the activity of cyclin A/Cdk2 complex The progression of cells from the G1 into the S phase is highly dependent on activity of the Cdk2/cyclin A/p21 WAF1/CIP1 complex. As shown in Figure 2A and B , the levels of Cdk2 and cyclin A were significantly reduced, while the kinase suppressor p21WAF1/CIP1 was significantly increased following treatment of the normal oral cell line with OSU03012. The reduced activity of the cyclin A/Cdk2 complex was confirmed by: i) the reduction in BrdU incorporation, an indicator of DNA synthesis ( Fig. 2C ); and ii) the lack of phosphorylation of recombinant Rb at Ser 807/811 ( Fig. 2D ). We next determined whether the induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 and its binding to the Cdk2/cyclin A complex contributes to the inactivation of Cdk2. 21 The Cdk2/cyclin A/ p21WAF1/CIP1 complex was immunoprecipitated with Cdk2 antibody, and then probed using anti-p21WAF1/CIP1 and anti-cyclin A antibodies. Figure 2D shows that p21WAF1/CIP1 and cyclin A were both immunoprecipitated by the Cdk2 antibody. Consistent with Figure 2A , the levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 markedly increased, while cyclin A decreased following treatment with OSU03012. These data suggest that the increased levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 in the normal cell line provide more opportunity for binding to the complex and inactivating cyclin A/Cdk2. Transformation of the normal oral cell line with E6 leads to loss of p53-p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> checkpoint and increased sensitivity to OSU03012 Upon treatment with OSU03012, the normal human oral epithelial cell line TE1177 showed a G1 arrest and resistant to apoptosis. Since normal cells have an intact G1/S checkpoint, we suspected that the p53-p21WAF1/CIP1 checkpoint or Rb pathway may affect the response of cells to treatment with OSU03012. To determine the role of the p53-p21WAF1/CIP1 checkpoint in OSU03012 cell sensitivity, the primary human epithelial cell line TE1177 was infected with retroviruses containing HPV16 E6. The role of Rb pathway was evaluated in HPV16 E7 infected cell lines. The HPV16 virus was used because of their significance in the development of HNSCC and the inference of E6 and E7 genes with cell cycle checkpoints. 33 ; 34 As expected, the resultant HPV16 E6 cell lines retain Rb and lost the p53-p21WAF1/CIP1 checkpoint exhibiting low levels of p53 and undetectable p21 ( Fig. 3A ). The HPV16 E7 cell lines exhibit greatly reduced levels of Rb and elevated levels of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 ( Fig. 3A ). The cell lines containing an empty vector were characteristic of the parent cell line. Transformation with HPV16 E6 resulting in the loss of p53-p21WAF1/CIP1 checkpoint significantly enhanced the sensitivity of the normal epithelial cell lines to growth inhibition by OSU03012, compared to the HPV16 E7 transformed, empty vector infected normal and the normal cell lines ( Fig. 3B ). The sensitivity of the E6 infected cell lines were due to apoptosis as indicated by the cleavage of PARP and caspase 3 ( Fig. 3C ). The parent, E7 and empty vector infected cell lines did not exhibit these indicators of apoptosis. E6-transformed normal oral cell lines have a larger S phase population prior to and post OSU03012 treatment The distribution of the E6 and E7 infected cells in cell cycle was investigated following OSU03012 treatment using flow cytometry ( Fig. 4 ). The empty vector infected TE1177 cells has a distribution similar to the parent TE1177 cell line. Infection with HPV16 E6 or HPV16 E7 reduced the population of cells in the G1 phase, increasing the number of cells in the S and G2/M phases. Following treatment with OSU03012, the empty vector infected TE1177 cells exhibited an increased G1 and reduced S phase populations similar to the parent TE1177 cells. OSU03012 treatment of HPV16 E6 infected cells did not alter the distribution of cells in the S phase. However, it decreased the number of cells (9.7 to 4.8%) in G2/M, while increasing cells (68.3 to 73.3%) in the G1 phase. In HPV16 E7 infected cells, treatment with OSU03012 led to a 25% reduction (18.1 to 13.5%) in the S phase population, with a concurrent increase (14.2 to 19.0%) in the G2/M population. Change in cell cycle proteins in transformed normal oral cell lines upon OSU03012 treatment The levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins and DNA synthesis were determined in the empty vector, E6 and E7 infected cell lines ( Fig. 5 ). Coinciding with the increased numbers of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, the levels of cyclin A and Cdk2 were increased, and p21WAF1/CIP1 was absent in the E6, compared to the empty vector cell lines ( Fig. 5A ). This corresponded to increased levels of DNA synthesis in the E6 cell line ( Fig. 5B ). In the E7 cell lines, where the increase in S phase cells is less than in E6 cells, the levels of cyclin A were similar, and Cdk2 and p21WAF1/CIP1 markedly increased compared to the parent cell line. While the levels of DNA synthesis in the E7 cell lines were higher than the empty vector, they were lower than the E6 cell lines. When the cell lines were treated with OSU03012, the levels of DNA synthesis, cyclin A and Cdk2 decreased in the empty vector and E7, and were not affected in the E6 cell lines. The levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 also increased in the empty vector, and remain elevated in the E7, but was absent in the E6 cell lines. These data suggest that a functional p21WAF1/CIP1, inhibiting the cyclin A/Cdk2 complex activity, protects cells from OSU03012 induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. G1 cell cycle proteins were investigated in empty vector, E6 or E7 infected normal cell lines. As shown in Figure 5C , OSU03012 increased the levels of cyclin E in E6- and E7-transformed normal cell lines. Cyclin D1 decreased in both E6- and E7-transformed cells, which is further reduced by OSU03012. E6-transformation enhanced Cdk4, whereas E7-transformation increased levels of Cdk6, both of which were slightly reduced by OSU03012. p27kip1 was increased by OSU03012 in E6-infected, but not in E7 or empty vector infected cell lines. Inactivation of p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> sensitizes cells to OSU03012 To further define the role of p21WAF1/CIP1 in sensitizing cells to OSU03012, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) deficient in p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21?/?), and wild type control cells were treated with OSU03012. Growth inhibition assays showed that the MEF p21 WAF1/CIP1?/? cell line was more sensitive than the wild type MEF cell line to OSU03012 ( Fig. 6A ). This growth inhibition pattern is similar to the E6-transformed normal human oral epithelial cell lines with undetectable levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 ( Fig. 3B ). We next investigated changes in G1 cell cycle proteins in MEF. OSU03012 decreased levels of cylin E, slightly increased levels of cyclin D1, Cdk4, and p27 in p21 WAF1/CIP1?/? MEF ( Fig. 5C ,). OSU03012 did not affect the levels of these proteins in p21 WAF1/CIP1?/? MEF. The protein levels of Cdk6 were very low in both p21+/+ and p21?/? MEF. The increase in p27 was similar to that observed in the E6 transformed human cell lines ( Fig. 5C ). Since p21 WAF1/CIP1?/? MEF are more sensitive to growth inhibition by OSU03012 ( Fig. 6A ), we further investigated whether apoptosis is involved. As shown in Fig. 6B , p21?/? MEF cells showed marked PARP and caspase 3 cleavages, further suggesting that the lack of p21WAF1/CIP1 sensitizes cells to OSU03012-induced apoptosis.  OSU03012 increases the number of normal oral human epithelial cells in the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle Figure 1 shows that, 85.3% of the normal human oral epithelial cells in line TE1177 were in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Upon treatment with OSU03012, the number of cells in the G1 phase increases in a concentration dependent manner to 97.3% and 91.28% at 5 ?M for 24 and 48 hr, respectively. Less than 3% of the cells were found in the S phase. These data are in contrast to OSU03012 markedly increasing the number cells in the S phase of the premalignant and malignant cell lines. 32 This suggests that OSU03012 may be targeting proteins regulating the progression through the cell cycle.

OSU03012 increases the levels of p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> reducing the activity of cyclin A/Cdk2 complex The progression of cells from the G1 into the S phase is highly dependent on activity of the Cdk2/cyclin A/p21 WAF1/CIP1 complex. As shown in Figure 2A and B , the levels of Cdk2 and cyclin A were significantly reduced, while the kinase suppressor p21WAF1/CIP1 was significantly increased following treatment of the normal oral cell line with OSU03012. The reduced activity of the cyclin A/Cdk2 complex was confirmed by: i) the reduction in BrdU incorporation, an indicator of DNA synthesis ( Fig. 2C ); and ii) the lack of phosphorylation of recombinant Rb at Ser 807/811 ( Fig. 2D ). We next determined whether the induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 and its binding to the Cdk2/cyclin A complex contributes to the inactivation of Cdk2. 21 The Cdk2/cyclin A/ p21WAF1/CIP1 complex was immunoprecipitated with Cdk2 antibody, and then probed using anti-p21WAF1/CIP1 and anti-cyclin A antibodies. Figure 2D shows that p21WAF1/CIP1 and cyclin A were both immunoprecipitated by the Cdk2 antibody. Consistent with Figure 2A , the levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 markedly increased, while cyclin A decreased following treatment with OSU03012. These data suggest that the increased levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 in the normal cell line provide more opportunity for binding to the complex and inactivating cyclin A/Cdk2.

The sensitivity of the E6 infected cell lines were due to apoptosis as indicated by the cleavage of PARP and caspase 3 ( Fig. 3C ). The parent, E7 and empty vector infected cell lines did not exhibit these indicators of apoptosis.  E6-transformed normal oral cell lines have a larger S phase population prior to and post OSU03012 treatment The distribution of the E6 and E7 infected cells in cell cycle was investigated following OSU03012 treatment using flow cytometry ( Fig. 4 ). The empty vector infected TE1177 cells has a distribution similar to the parent TE1177 cell line. Infection with HPV16 E6 or HPV16 E7 reduced the population of cells in the G1 phase, increasing the number of cells in the S and G2/M phases. Following treatment with OSU03012, the empty vector infected TE1177 cells exhibited an increased G1 and reduced S phase populations similar to the parent TE1177 cells. OSU03012 treatment of HPV16 E6 infected cells did not alter the distribution of cells in the S phase. However, it decreased the number of cells (9.7 to 4.8%) in G2/M, while increasing cells (68.3 to 73.3%) in the G1 phase. In HPV16 E7 infected cells, treatment with OSU03012 led to a 25% reduction (18.1 to 13.5%) in the S phase population, with a concurrent increase (14.2 to 19.0%) in the G2/M population.

Change in cell cycle proteins in transformed normal oral cell lines upon OSU03012 treatment The levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins and DNA synthesis were determined in the empty vector, E6 and E7 infected cell lines ( Fig. 5 ). Coinciding with the increased numbers of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, the levels of cyclin A and Cdk2 were increased, and p21WAF1/CIP1 was absent in the E6, compared to the empty vector cell lines ( Fig. 5A ). This corresponded to increased levels of DNA synthesis in the E6 cell line ( Fig. 5B ). In the E7 cell lines, where the increase in S phase cells is less than in E6 cells, the levels of cyclin A were similar, and Cdk2 and p21WAF1/CIP1 markedly increased compared to the parent cell line. While the levels of DNA synthesis in the E7 cell lines were higher than the empty vector, they were lower than the E6 cell lines. When the cell lines were treated with OSU03012, the levels of DNA synthesis, cyclin A and Cdk2 decreased in the empty vector and E7, and were not affected in the E6 cell lines. The levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 also increased in the empty vector, and remain elevated in the E7, but was absent in the E6 cell lines. These data suggest that a functional p21WAF1/CIP1, inhibiting the cyclin A/Cdk2 complex activity, protects cells from OSU03012 induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. G1 cell cycle proteins were investigated in empty vector, E6 or E7 infected normal cell lines. As shown in Figure 5C , OSU03012 increased the levels of cyclin E in E6- and E7-transformed normal cell lines. Cyclin D1 decreased in both E6- and E7-transformed cells, which is further reduced by OSU03012. E6-transformation enhanced Cdk4, whereas E7-transformation increased levels of Cdk6, both of which were slightly reduced by OSU03012. p27kip1 was increased by OSU03012 in E6-infected, but not in E7 or empty vector infected cell lines.

Inactivation of p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> sensitizes cells to OSU03012 To further define the role of p21WAF1/CIP1 in sensitizing cells to OSU03012, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) deficient in p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21?/?), and wild type control cells were treated with OSU03012. Growth inhibition assays showed that the MEF p21 WAF1/CIP1?/? cell line was more sensitive than the wild type MEF cell line to OSU03012 ( Fig. 6A ). This growth inhibition pattern is similar to the E6-transformed normal human oral epithelial cell lines with undetectable levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 ( Fig. 3B ). We next investigated changes in G1 cell cycle proteins in MEF. OSU03012 decreased levels of cylin E, slightly increased levels of cyclin D1, Cdk4, and p27 in p21 WAF1/CIP1?/? MEF ( Fig. 5C ,). OSU03012 did not affect the levels of these proteins in p21 WAF1/CIP1?/? MEF. The protein levels of Cdk6 were very low in both p21+/+ and p21?/? MEF. The increase in p27 was similar to that observed in the E6 transformed human cell lines ( Fig. 5C ). Since p21 WAF1/CIP1?/? MEF are more sensitive to growth inhibition by OSU03012 ( Fig. 6A ), we further investigated whether apoptosis is involved. As shown in Fig. 6B , p21?/? MEF cells showed marked PARP and caspase 3 cleavages, further suggesting that the lack of p21WAF1/CIP1 sensitizes cells to OSU03012-induced apoptosis.  Inactivation of p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> sensitizes cells to OSU03012 To further define the role of p21WAF1/CIP1 in sensitizing cells to OSU03012, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) deficient in p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21?/?), and wild type control cells were treated with OSU03012. Growth inhibition assays showed that the MEF p21 WAF1/CIP1?/? cell line was more sensitive than the wild type MEF cell line to OSU03012 ( Fig. 6A ). This growth inhibition pattern is similar to the E6-transformed normal human oral epithelial cell lines with undetectable levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 ( Fig. 3B ). We next investigated changes in G1 cell cycle proteins in MEF. OSU03012 decreased levels of cylin E, slightly increased levels of cyclin D1, Cdk4, and p27 in p21 WAF1/CIP1?/? MEF ( Fig. 5C ,).

MEF cells showed marked PARP and caspase 3 cleavages, further suggesting that the lack of p21WAF1/CIP1 sensitizes cells to OSU03012-induced apoptosis.  Discussion OSU03012 has been listed in the National Cancer Institute Rapid Access to Intervention Development program. More studies are needed to address its effects and mechanisms, especially on normal cells. Here we investigated two G1/S checkpoint pathways, p53-p21WAF1/CIP1 and Rb, that may be involved in the apoptotic effect of OSU03012. Our studies indicate that apoptosis induced by OSU03012 is dependent upon the cellular status of p21WAF1/CIP1. During cancer development, cell cycle-regulating genes are often altered. Many human oral cancer cell lines have mutated p53 leading to loss of the p21WAF1/CIP1 checkpoint. 35 Studies have demonstrated the role of these genes in the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs 24 . Functional p21WAF1/CIP1 in cancerous cell lines markedly attenuates apoptosis and enhances survival upon exposed to chemotherapeutic agents and X ray. 36 - 40 In the present study, the loss of p21WAF1/CIP1 protein from normal human oral epithelial cell lines enhances the apoptotic effects of OSU03012. This relationship was also confirmed in MEF cell lines lacking the p21WAF1/CIP1 gene. This suggests that the p53/p21WAF1/CIP1 cycle checkpoint is an important factor in OSU03012 induced apoptosis. Since the p53/p21WAF1/CIP1 check point is intact in normal cells but disrupted in many cancer cells, these data suggest that cancer cells lacking p53/p21WAF1/CIP1 may be selectively eliminated by apoptosis induced by OSU03012. p21 WAF1/CIP1 has been reported to inhibit apoptosis by the induction of cell cycle arrest and inactivation of cyclin A/Cdk2. 40 Upon binding of the p21WAF1/CIP1 protein to the cyclin/Cdk complex, both cell cycle progression and apoptosis are blocked. 40 In the present study, HPV16 E6 transformed normal human epithelial cell lines express undetectable levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 with high levels of Cdk2. This leads to a higher number of cells in the S phase and apoptosis induced by OSU03012. While the normal cell lines infected with HPV16 E7 also have a large population of cells in the S phase, they exhibit high levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 with lower Cdk2 activity, and resistance to OSU03012, similar to the normal parent cell line. Our data suggest that sensitivity to OSU03012 is correlated with increased S phase and defective p21WAF1/CIP1. It is interesting that a recent study on Celecoxib showed that Celecoxib selectively killed human oral cancer cell lines in the S phase with low levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 and by inference higher Cdk2 activity. 41 These data are consistent with other studies suggesting that inactivation of p21WAF1/CIP1 and/or activation of Cdks are important factors in ionizing radiation and anticancer agent induced apoptosis in cancer cell lines. 42 ; 43 Together, these studies suggest that the status of the p53/p21WAF1/CIP1 checkpoint and the activity of Cdk2 are important factors in the sensitivity of human oral epithelial cell lines to OSU03012. p27kip1 is also a Cdk inhibitor. Recent studies suggest that p27kip1 also has apoptotic-promoting function and p27kip1 expression levels have both prognostic and therapeutic implications. 44 - 46 OSU03012 increased the protein levels of p27kip1 in both E6-transformed normal cell lines and p21-deficient MEF cells, but not in vector- and E7-infected normal cell lines and p21 wild type MEF. These data favor the proapoptotic role of p27kip1 in the absence of the cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1. Further studies are required to test this hypothesis. Rb is also an important protein in controlling the progression of cells from G1 into S. Upstream, E7 mediates the degradation of Rb leading to the release of E2F, which in turn activates PCNA and Cdk2/cyclin E, facilitating the movement of cells into the S phase. Deletion of Rb may sensitize human cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. 24 Our studies show that compromising the function of Rb, following infection of the normal cell line with HPV16 E7 does not increase the sensitivity of the normal cell line to OSU03012. This may be related to the noted marked increase in p21WAF1/CIP1 protein in these cell lines which in turn may inhibit cyclin A/Cdk2 activity, and/or Cdk-dependent caspase activation. 42 In conclusion, our results indicate that OSU03012 induces a G1 cell cycle arrest in normal human oral epithelial cell lines. Loss of functional p53/ p21WAF1/CIP1 sensitizes cells to OSU03012-induced apoptosis. Considering that the function of p21 WAF1/CIP1 is often compromised by loss of p53 function or other upstream signaling proteins in cancer cells, 47 ; 47 these findings may have clinical relevance.  Discussion OSU03012 has been listed in the National Cancer Institute Rapid Access to Intervention Development program. More studies are needed to address its effects and mechanisms, especially on normal cells. Here we investigated two G1/S checkpoint pathways, p53-p21WAF1/CIP1 and Rb, that may be involved in the apoptotic effect of OSU03012. Our studies indicate that apoptosis induced by OSU03012 is dependent upon the cellular status of p21WAF1/CIP1. During cancer development, cell cycle-regulating genes are often altered. Many human oral cancer cell lines have mutated p53 leading to loss of the p21WAF1/CIP1 checkpoint. 35 Studies have demonstrated the role of these genes in the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs 24 . Functional p21WAF1/CIP1 in cancerous cell lines markedly attenuates apoptosis and enhances survival upon exposed to chemotherapeutic agents and X ray. 36 - 40 In the present study, the loss of p21WAF1/CIP1 protein from normal human oral epithelial cell lines enhances the apoptotic effects of OSU03012. This relationship was also confirmed in MEF cell lines lacking the p21WAF1/CIP1 gene. This suggests that the p53/p21WAF1/CIP1 cycle checkpoint is an important factor in OSU03012 induced apoptosis. Since the p53/p21WAF1/CIP1 check point is intact in normal cells but disrupted in many cancer cells, these data suggest that cancer cells lacking p53/p21WAF1/CIP1 may be selectively eliminated by apoptosis induced by OSU03012. p21 WAF1/CIP1 has been reported to inhibit apoptosis by the induction of cell cycle arrest and inactivation of cyclin A/Cdk2. 40 Upon binding of the p21WAF1/CIP1 protein to the cyclin/Cdk complex, both cell cycle progression and apoptosis are blocked. 40 In the present study, HPV16 E6 transformed normal human epithelial cell lines express undetectable levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 with high levels of Cdk2. This leads to a higher number of cells in the S phase and apoptosis induced by OSU03012. While the normal cell lines infected with HPV16 E7 also have a large population of cells in the S phase, they exhibit high levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 with lower Cdk2 activity, and resistance to OSU03012, similar to the normal parent cell line. Our data suggest that sensitivity to OSU03012 is correlated with increased S phase and defective p21WAF1/CIP1. It is interesting that a recent study on Celecoxib showed that Celecoxib selectively killed human oral cancer cell lines in the S phase with low levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 and by inference higher Cdk2 activity. 41 These data are consistent with other studies suggesting that inactivation of p21WAF1/CIP1 and/or activation of Cdks are important factors in ionizing radiation and anticancer agent induced apoptosis in cancer cell lines. 42 ; 43 Together, these studies suggest that the status of the p53/p21WAF1/CIP1 checkpoint and the activity of Cdk2 are important factors in the sensitivity of human oral epithelial cell lines to OSU03012. p27kip1 is also a Cdk inhibitor. Recent studies suggest that p27kip1 also has apoptotic-promoting function and p27kip1 expression levels have both prognostic and therapeutic implications. 44 - 46 OSU03012 increased the protein levels of p27kip1 in both E6-transformed normal cell lines and p21-deficient MEF cells, but not in vector- and E7-infected normal cell lines and p21 wild type MEF. These data favor the proapoptotic role of p27kip1 in the absence of the cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1. Further studies are required to test this hypothesis. Rb is also an important protein in controlling the progression of cells from G1 into S. Upstream, E7 mediates the degradation of Rb leading to the release of E2F, which in turn activates PCNA and Cdk2/cyclin E, facilitating the movement of cells into the S phase. Deletion of Rb may sensitize human cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. 24 Our studies show that compromising the function of Rb, following infection of the normal cell line with HPV16 E7 does not increase the sensitivity of the normal cell line to OSU03012. This may be related to the noted marked increase in p21WAF1/CIP1 protein in these cell lines which in turn may inhibit cyclin A/Cdk2 activity, and/or Cdk-dependent caspase activation. 42 In conclusion, our results indicate that OSU03012 induces a G1 cell cycle arrest in normal human oral epithelial cell lines. Loss of functional p53/ p21WAF1/CIP1 sensitizes cells to OSU03012-induced apoptosis. Considering that the function of p21 WAF1/CIP1 is often compromised by loss of p53 function or other upstream signaling proteins in cancer cells, 47 ; 47 these findings may have clinical relevance.
