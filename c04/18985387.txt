Genetic variants in the Renin-Angiotensin System genes are associated with Cardiovascular-Renal-related risk factors in Mexican Americans The aim of this study was to examine whether the ACE-I/D , AGT-M235T , and AT1R-A1166C polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) genes are associated with cardiovascular and renal-related risk factors in Mexican Americans. Study participants (N=848) were genotyped by Taqman assays. Association analyses were performed by measured genotype approach. Of the phenotypes examined, the ACE-I/D, AGT-M235T , and AT1R-A1166C polymorphisms exhibited significant association with systolic blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate and body mass index, respectively. The data suggest that the polymorphisms examined in the RAS may modulate the risk factors associated with cardiovascular-renal disease.
