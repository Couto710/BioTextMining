Relaxin Increases Elastase Activity and Protease Inhibitors in Smooth Muscle Cells from the Myometrium compared to Cells from Leiomyomas Structured Abstract Objective Leiomyoma growth is dependent on ovarian steroids. Estrogen stimulates growth while progesterone can have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects. We sought to investigate the effect of relaxin on extracellular matrix metabolism (ECM) remodeling in myometrium compared to leiomyomas. Design Smooth muscle cells were cultured from large myomas and their corresponding myometrium and stimulated with different concentrations of relaxin. Total elastase activity, ?-1 antitrypsin (ATT), TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 expressions were measured. Setting Medical school university hospital. Patient(s) Four premenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy. Intervention(s) Smooth muscle cells from leiomyomas and their corresponding myometrium were stimulated with different concentrations of relaxin. Main Outcome Measure(s) Elastase activity and protease inhibitor levels in smooth muscle cells. Results Relaxin-stimulated myometrial cells showed a positive response curve with respect to total elastase activity, ATT, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 expressions, while leiomyoma cells showed no response to relaxin stimulation. Conclusion Relaxin stimulates ECM remodeling in the myometrium, while it does not seem to affect leiomyomas.
