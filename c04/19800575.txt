A lymphotoxin-driven pathway to hepatocellular carcinoma Summary Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) cause chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by poorly understood mechanisms. We show that cytokines lymphotoxin (LT) ?, ? and their receptor (LT?R) are upregulated in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC. Liver-specific LT?? expression in mice induces liver inflammation and HCC causally linking hepatic LT overexpression to hepatitis and HCC. Development of HCC, composed in part of A6+ oval cells, depends on lymphocytes and IKappa B kinase ? expressed by hepatocytes but is independent of TNFR1. In vivo LT?R stimulation implicates hepatocytes as the major LT-responsive liver cells and LT?R inhibition in LT??-transgenic mice with hepatitis suppresses HCC formation. Thus, sustained LT signaling represents a pathway involved in hepatitis-induced HCC.  Introduction A causal relationship between chronic hepatitis, hepatocellular damage, fibrosis and carcinogenesis is well established ( El-Serag and Rudolph, 2007 ). Various etiologies, including chronic alcohol consumption, chronic drug abuse, autoimmune disorders, toxins (e.g. aflatoxin B) or infections with hepatotropic viruses (e.g. HBV, HCV) can lead to chronic hepatitis, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. HBV- and HCV-infections are by far the most common cause of chronic hepatitis in humans ( Malhi et al., 2006 ). Chronic HBV- and HCV-infections are frequently associated with HCC, the most prevalent primary human liver cancer ( El-Serag and Rudolph, 2007 ), and except for HBV-infections, liver cirrhosis precedes HCC in most cases. The exact mechanisms driving hepatitis-induced liver cancer remain elusive. Among others, aberrant expression of cytotoxic cytokines is thought to be critically involved ( Greten and Karin, 2004 ; Lee et al., 2005 ; Lowes et al., 2003 ; Vainer et al., 2008 ). The pro-inflammatory and homeostatic cytokines LT? and LT? are members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. Under physiological conditions LTs are expressed by activated T-, B-, NK- and lymphoid tissue inducer cells ( Fu et al., 1998 ; Ware, 2005 ) and are crucial for organogenesis and maintenance of lymphoid tissues ( Tumanov et al., 2003 ). Whereas LT? contains a transmembrane domain, LT? is soluble. Consequently, LT can exist as membrane bound heterotrimers (LT?1?2 or LT?2?1) interacting with LT?R or as soluble secreted homotrimers (LT?3) triggering TNF receptor 1, 2 (TNFR1, TNFR2) and the herpes virus entry mediator receptor (HVEM) ( Browning et al., 1997 ; Ware, 2005 ). LT?R and TNFR1 signaling can be activated by the HCV-core protein ( Chen et al., 1997 ; Zhu et al., 1998 ) involving the canonical or non-canonical NF-?B signaling pathways ( Ware, 2005 ; You et al., 1999 ). Furthermore, HBV- or HCV-infections lead to increased hepatic LT expression in vivo and in vitro ( Lee et al., 2005 ; Lowes et al., 2003 ) and HCV replication has been demonstrated to depend on components of the LT?R signaling pathway in vitro ( Ng et al., 2007 ). LTs can directly act on hepatocytes which physiologically express high levels of LT?R but little LT ( Browning and French, 2002 ). T-cell-derived LT and LIGHT (LT-like, exhibits inducible expression, competes with HSV glycoprotein D for HVEM, expressed by T-lymphocytes) signaling to hepatocytes controls lipoprotein homeostasis ( Lo et al., 2007 ). In addition, LT signaling is important for liver regeneration through T-cell-derived LT expression ( Tumanov et al., 2008 ) and regulates hepatic stellate cell function and wound healing ( Ruddell et al., 2008 ). Thus, hepatic LT?R signaling controls liver homeostasis in both health and disease. Promotion of HCC formation by chronic inflammatory stimuli has been recapitulated in various animal models. Ablation of the multi-drug resistance gene 2 ( mdr2 ) induces cholestatic hepatitis and liver cancer ( Pikarsky et al., 2004 ) and administration of the chemical carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN) causes acute liver injury and HCC ( Maeda et al., 2005 ). Liver specific expression of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in mice demonstrates that chronic immune-mediated liver cell injury is critical for HCC formation ( Nakamoto et al., 1998 ). Triggering TNFR1 or LT?R induces the classical and alternative NF-?B signaling pathways, which are linked to inflammation-induced carcinogenesis ( Greten and Karin, 2004 ). However, the precise role of these pathways in HCC pathogenesis is controversial ( Vainer et al., 2008 ). Mice lacking IKappa B kinase ? (IKK?) specifically in hepatocytes ( Ikk? ?hep ) exhibit a marked increase in DEN-induced HCC formation suggesting a protective function of IKK? in HCC development ( Maeda et al., 2005 ). In contrast, NF-?B signaling promotes HCC development in mdr2 ?/? mice and anti-TNF? treatment is protective ( Pikarsky et al., 2004 ). Interestingly, mice with a hepatocyte-specific deletion of IKK? (also called NEMO) develop steatohepatitis and HCC ( Luedde et al., 2007 ). Consequently, the role of NF-?B signaling in hepatocarcinogenesis might depend on the mouse model and the type or degree of liver inflammation and injury ( Vainer et al., 2008 ). Here, we investigated a possible causal relationship between sustained hepatic LT?R-signaling, chronic hepatitis and HCC development.  Experimental Procedures Human liver tissue Human liver biopsies were obtained from University Hospitals Zurich, Freiburg, Grenoble, Heidelberg and Graz. Biopsies were registered in the respective biobanks and kept anonymous. The research project was authorized by the ethical committees of the “Gesundheitsdirektion Kanton Zürich” (Ref. Nr. StV 26-2005), Freiburg (Nr. 299/2001), Heidelberg (Prof. Bannasch), Graz (Ref. Nr. 1.0 24/11/2008) and Grenoble (Ref. Nr. 03/APTF/1). The study protocol was in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki declaration. Patients were enrolled after giving their written informed consent. HBV- or HCV infected patients with chronic hepatitis were not treated with ribavirin or other immunomodulatory drugs at the time point of needle biopsy. Mice Animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and experiments were approved and conform with the guidelines of the Swiss Animal Protection Law, Veterinary office, Canton Zurich. Mouse experiments were performed under licences 198/2007; 83/2007; 30/2005 according to the regulations of the Veterinary office of the Canton Zurich. Tg 1223, tg 1222, Tnfr1 ?/? , Tnfr2 ?/?, Rag1 ?/?, Lt?r ?/? , Ikk? AA/AA and Ikk? ?hep mice were generated as previously published ( Bluethmann et al., 1994 ; Cao et al., 2001 ; Futterer et al., 1998 ; Heikenwalder et al., 2005 ; Maeda et al., 2005 ; Mombaerts et al., 1992 ). TNF? and 3C8 treatment Twelve to fourteen week-old male mice (C57BL/6 and knock-out mice) were i.v. injected with either PBS, murine recombinant TNF? (50?g/kg bodyweight; R&D Systems), agonistic LT?R antibody (50?g/mouse; clone 3C8; eBioscience) or rat IgG (50?g/mouse; eBioscience) and sacrificed for analysis 45 min post injection. All substances were injected at a total volume of 100?l dissolved in PBS. Isolation of intrahepatic murine lymphocytes (IHL) Mice were anesthetized and liver was perfused with PBS to remove circulating leukocytes, then isolated liver tissue was minced and digested in medium containing collagenase (1mg/ml) and DNase (25?g/ml) at 37°C for 40 min. Cells were centrifuged at 300rpm for 3 min to sediment the majority of hepatocytes. Supernatant was removed and centrifuged again at 1200 rpm for 10 min. Cell pellet was resuspended in the 40% fraction of a 40:80 Percoll gradient. Upon centrifugation at 2500rpm for 20 min, IHL were collected at the interface. IHL were analyzed for surface marker expression by staining with anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-TCR-?, anti-NK1.1 or anti-CD19 Abs, and for cytokine production capacity by intracellular staining with anti-IFN? and anti-IL17 Abs (all from eBioscience) upon PMA/Ionomycin stimulation by using a two-laser FACScalibur (BD). Analysis was executed with CellQuest and FlowJo software. Cytokine production by IHL was determined by intracellular staining with anti-IFN? and anti-IL17 antibodies (all from eBioscience) after 4 hrs stimulation with PMA and Ionomycin. Measurement of aminotransferases The analysis for AST and ALT was performed with mouse serum on a Roche Modular System (Roche Diagnostics) with a commercially available automated colorimetric system at the Institute of Clinical Chemistry at the University Hospital Zurich using a Hitachi P-Modul (Roche).

Supplementary Material 01  Results Upregulation of LT?, LT? and LT?R in HBV or HCV infected human livers and in HCC The specific role of LT signaling in the pathogenesis of virus-induced hepatitis and HCC formation is not completely defined. We analyzed transcriptional levels of LT? , LT? , LIGHT , TNF? , LT?R and TNFR1 in human HBV- or HCV-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC or in non-viral HCC compared to healthy liver specimens ( Figure 1 , Figure S1 ). LT? , LT? and LT?R mRNA expression was increased on average ~27 to 210 fold in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.001), LIGHT transcripts were less, but still significantly, elevated (on average ~23 to 25 fold; P <0.001). Likewise, TNFR1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC (on average ~27 to 29 fold; P <0.0001). In contrast, TNF? was only slightly upregulated in HBV-induced hepatitis ( P =0.04) but not in HCV-induced hepatitis ( P =0.3) and HCC ( P =0.4). In most cases, HCV genotype, degree of inflammation (Knodell score), fibrosis (Metavir score) and liver enzyme levels (ALT; AST) were assessed ( Tables S1–S5 ). Levels of LT? , LT? and LT?R mRNA did not correlate with the degree of liver inflammation ( P =0.5), fibrosis ( P =0.5), patient age ( P =0.5), gender ( P =0.5), HCV genotype or type of virus infection (HBV; HCV; HBV/HCV co-infection in the case of some HCC; P =0.5) ( Figure S1 ; data not shown). To determine whether upregulation of LT ligands and receptors was specific for HBV- or HCV-induced liver diseases, we examined transcript levels in non-viral liver diseases. These included liver disorders with hepatitis [alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH); cholestasis (CH); primary biliary cirrhosis/autoimmune cholangitis (PBC); end-stage liver cirrhosis due to alcoholic liver disease (CIR)] and liver diseases without inflammation [steatosis (ST), focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)]. Additionally, other liver diseases (OLD) such as hemochromatosis/siderosis, Wilson’s disease, focal liver fibrosis, ?1-antitrypsin deficiency and non-viral HCC (NVH) were investigated. Levels of LT?, LT? and LT?R mRNA were significantly lower in all non-viral liver diseases analyzed except NVH when compared to virus-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC ( LT?: P <0.0001; LT?: P =0.05; LT?R: P <0.0001; Figure 1 , Figure S1 ). This was irrespective of whether non-viral liver diseases were associated with inflammation. LIGHT and TNFR1 mRNA expression in non-viral liver diseases including NVH was similar to HBV- or HCV-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC. In contrast, TNF? mRNA expression was significantly higher in non-viral liver diseases with inflammation and NVH compared to healthy livers ( P <0.0001), HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.0001). Increased chemokine expression in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC To confirm that pro-inflammatory signaling cascades are activated during HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC formation, chemokine mRNA levels were measured ( Figure S1 ). CCL2, CCL3, CCL5 and CXCL10 mRNA expression was significantly higher in human HBV- ( P <0.0001) or HCV- ( P <0.0001) induced hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.0001) compared to healthy controls. CXCL1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in HBV-induced hepatitis ( P <0.0001) and HCC ( P =0.02) but not in HCV-induced hepatitis ( P =0.07). Upregulation of LT?, LT?, LIGHT in human hepatoyctes upon HCV infection in vitro We next investigated whether LT? , LT? , LIGHT and LT?R transcripts can be upregulated in hepatocytes as a consequence of viral infection. The human hepatocyte cell line Huh-7.5 ( Blight et al., 2002 ) was challenged with infectious HCVcc ( Pietschmann et al., 2006 ) and the expression of cytokines and chemokines was measured ( Figure S2A ). At 48 to 72 hrs post infection, transcripts of LT? ( P =0.05), LT? ( P =0.05), LIGHT ( P =0.05), LT?R ( P =0.05) and chemokines ( CCL2 , CCL3 , CXCL1 and CXCL10 ) were increased (2–32 fold) in HCVcc-infected compared to non-infected Huh-7.5 cells. Identification of liver cells expressing LT?R and its ligands in HBV or HCV infections To identify the cellular source of LT? , LT? , LT?R and LIGHT expression in human HCV-infected livers, cells were collected from HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC ( Figure 2A , Figure S2B ). Liver cells were sorted according to their CD45 surface expression, resulting in CD45-enriched (T-, B-cells; monocytes, macrophages/Kupffer cells; dendritic and NK-cells) or CD45-depleted (hepatocytes, oval cells, bile duct epithelial and endothelial cells) fractions. Purity of these fractions was assessed by real-time PCR for lymphocyte (CD3; CD20; CD45) or hepatocyte (cytokeratin 18) markers. CD45-depleted fractions displayed only a minor contamination with CD45 mRNA (~1–10%) whereas CD45-enriched fractions showed only a minor amount of cytokeratin 18 mRNA transcripts (~2–20%; Figure S2C ; data not shown). Unsorted liver cells of healthy individuals were included as controls. Because of ethical consideration not enough human healthy liver tissue was available in order to perform cell sorting. Within HCV-induced HCC, CD45-enriched and -depleted liver cells expressed similar LT? or LT? mRNA levels (LT?: P =0.8; LT?: P =0.1) that were significantly higher than in controls ( P <0.0001) ( Figure 2A ). LT?R mRNA transcript levels were significantly higher in CD45-depleted cells compared to CD45-enriched cells ( P =0.006), or controls ( P <0.0001). In contrast, LIGHT mRNA expression was significantly increased in CD45-enriched cells when compared to CD45-depleted cells ( P =0.008), or controls ( P =0.0007). Within HCV-induced hepatitis, CD45-enriched cells exhibited a trend towards increased LT? mRNA levels ( P =0.089) and a significant rise in both LT? and LIGHT transcripts compared to CD45-depleted cells ( LT?: P =0.006; LIGHT: P =0.01), or controls. Similar to HCV-induced HCC, LT?R mRNA expression was significantly higher in CD45-depleted cells compared to CD45-enriched cells ( P =0.002), or controls ( P <0.0001). Thus, both CD45-enriched and CD45-depleted cell fractions express LT? , LT? and LIGHT in HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC. Immunohistochemical analysis for LT? protein expression corroborated these data: CD3+, CD20+ lymphocytes and hepatocytes in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC, but not those in healthy liver specimens, express LT? protein ( Figure 2C ). Hepatocyte-specific LT? and ? overexpression induces chronic progressive hepatitis To determine whether sustained hepatic LT?R signaling is causally linked to chronic hepatitis and liver cancer, we analyzed two transgenic mouse lines that expressed LT? and ? in a liver specific manner at low ( tg 1222) or high ( tg 1223) level ( Heikenwalder et al., 2005 ). Although livers of tg 1222 and tg 1223 mice were histologically indistinguishable from those of control littermates at three months of age ( Figure S3 ), the hepatic transcriptome was already considerably altered in tg 1223 and to a lesser degree in tg 1222 mice ( Figure 3A ; data not shown). Genes with the most dramatic expression changes were identified by DNA-microarray analysis and confirmed by real-time PCR ( Figure 3A ). As expected, Lt? and Lt? transcripts were increased in tg 1222 and tg 1223 livers ( Figure 3A ; data not shown). Additionally, mRNA expression of chemokines ( Ccl2 , Ccl7, Cxcl1 , Cxcl10 ) , genes involved in early growth response (e.g. Egr1 , Egr2 ), cholesterol metabolism (e.g. Ch25h ) and immediate early response (e.g. c-Fos, Jun-b, Socs-3 ) were significantly ( P <0.0001) elevated. In contrast, genes involved in cell cycle control, histone modifications and cell metabolism were significantly downregulated ( P <0.0001) ( Figure 3A ; Tables S6–S8, Figure S4 ). In situ hybridization revealed Lt? , Lt? , Cxcl10, Ccl2 and Egr1 mRNA transcripts in hepatocytes of 3 months old tg 1223 ( Figure 3B , Figure S3 ). At the age of 4 months a slight increase in intrahepatic CD11b+, CD68+ and MHCII+ cells was detected in tg 1223 mice compared to age-matched tg 1222 or C57BL/6 mice ( Figure S3 ; data not shown). At this time point, no significant increase in IL1?, IFN?, IL6 and TNF? protein levels was found (data not shown). At 4–6 months transgenic livers started to develop strong portal and lobular ( tg 1223) or weak portal ( tg 1222) inflammation consisting of CD4+, CD8+ T-cells, B220+ B-cells and CD11c+ dendritic cells ( Figure S3 ; Heikenwalder et al., 2005 ). At ? 9 months of age, tg 1223 livers exhibited strong portal and lobular lymphocytic infiltrates ( Figure 3C ). A pronounced influx of F4/80+ macrophages and proliferation of A6+ oval cells was observed. Chronic inflammation coincided with increased proliferating Ki67+ hepatocytes ( tg 1223: 17±5 Ki67+cells/mm2 liver section; C57BL/6: 0.5±0.3 Ki67+cells/mm2 liver section; P =0.003), which was not significant in age-matched tg 1222 livers ( P =0.08; Figure 3C ; data not shown). At this stage, hepatitis was accompanied by increased protein levels of IL1? ( P =0.05), IFN? ( P =0.05) and IL6 ( P =0.05) and, to a lesser degree, of TNF? in tg 1223 livers. In tg 1222 livers we observed only a slight elevation of these cytokines compared to C57BL/6 ( Figure 3D ). Quantitative analysis of total intrahepatic lymphocytes revealed an increase in tg 1223 livers (C57BL/6: 17–24×106 cells/liver; tg 1223: 35–73×106 cells/liver P <0.05). Intrahepatic lymphocytes were further characterized by flow cytometry ( Figure 3E ). Frequencies of CD8+ (C57BL/6: 18±11%; tg 1223: 38±10%), CD4+ (C57BL/6: 16±3%; tg 1223: 26±6%) and TCR?+ T-cells (C57BL/6: 33.5±9%; tg 1223: 63.5±4%) were elevated (n=4), while NK1.1+ cells (C57BL/6: 12±2%; tg 1223: 7±2%) were reduced in tg 1223 livers. Furthermore, an increase in the frequency of CD19+ B-cells was found in tg 1223 livers (C57BL/6: 25±7%; tg 1223: 52±4%). Elevated frequencies of IFN?-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were found in tg 1223 mice, while IL17-producing cells remained unchanged ( Figure 3E ; data not shown). LT? and LT? overexpression induces hepatotoxicity To determine whether chronic hepatitis leads to hepatocyte cell death in tg 1222 or tg 1223 mice, we analyzed serum transaminase levels (ALT and AST). From the age of 19 weeks on, serum ALT and AST levels were significantly elevated ( P =0.05) in tg 1223 but not in tg 1222 mice ( Figure 4A ) and apoptotic hepatocytes were frequently detected in tg 1223 mice ( tg 1223: 40.3±11.4 TUNEL+cells/mm2 liver section; C57BL/6: 3.9±6.2 TUNEL+cells/mm2 liver section; P =0.0005) but rarely in tg 1222 and virtually absent in C57BL/6 mouse livers from the age of 6 months on ( Figure 4B , Figure S5 ; data not shown for tg 1222). Hepatitis persisted in both transgenic lines for 18 months. Phenotypes were much milder in tg 1222 mice, implying that the LT expression level determined the severity of inflammation and liver injury. Therefore, tg 1223 mice were selected for additional experiments and further key results were obtained from this mouse line. Microarray and real-time PCR analyses revealed elevated mRNA expression of genes involved in embryogenesis (e.g. Dmrta1 ), liver inflammation (e.g. Pbfe1 ), carcinogenesis (e.g. Phlda3, Thrsp ; Kawase et al., 2009 ), glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (e.g. Fgf21 ) and reduced mRNA expression of genes responsible for cell cycle control ( Gadd45g ) and protease inhibition ( SerpinA9 ) in nine month-old tg 1223 livers compared to C57BL/6 livers ( Figure S5; Tables S9–S11 ). Several genes strongly up- or downregulated in 3 month-old tg 1223 livers ( Figure 3A ) returned to normal levels at 9 months, except that Lt? and ? mRNAs remained at high levels. On the other hand, genes involved in cell division, liver inflammation, lipid metabolism, wound healing and tumorigenesis were significantly upregulated ( P <0.001) whereas genes involved in growth arrest and apoptosis were significantly downregulated ( P <0.001) in 9 month-old compared to 3 month-old tg 1223 livers ( Figure S5; Tables S12–S17 ). HCC development in tg1223 mice At 12 months of age, about 20% (6/34) of tg 1223 mice developed macroscopically visible nodules that classified histologically as HCC, including broadening of liver cell cords, loss of collagen IV networks and increased proliferative activity. In contrast, age-matched C57BL/6 livers lacked HCC (0/20; P =0.05) ( Figures 4C, 4D , and 5 ). Tumor frequency increased with age reaching ~35% (18/51) by 18 months, whereas C57BL/6 mice did not develop HCC (0/35; P <0.0001) ( Figure 5 , Figure S6 ). Tumors varied in size (1–25mm), histology and affected both genders with similar frequencies (males:females = 13:11; P =0.3) ( Figure 4 ; Tables S18 and S19 ). A6+ oval cells ( Engelhardt et al., 1990 ) were focally (8/24) or diffusely (2/24) distributed within some tg 1223 HCC. The remaining tg 1223 HCC (14/24) lacked A6+ cells but were surrounded by them at the border zone of HCC ( Figure S6 ). Chromosomal aberrations and local spread of HCC in tg1223 mice We further investigated micro-dissected tg 1223 HCC (n=9) and age-matched C57BL/6 livers (n=5) for chromosomal aberrations. Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis (aCGH) revealed chromosomal aberrations in all tg 1223 HCC ( Figure 6 ). Amplifications and deletions of chromosomal regions ranged from ? 1 mega-base (MB) to 160 MB and were detected in most autosomes of all analyzed tg 1223 HCC. Of note, the pattern of chromosomal aberrations varied in HCC from different individual tg 1223 mice ( P =0.34). aCGH analysis of independent C57BL/6 liver DNA samples did not reveal significant chromosomal aberrations. We did not detect lung metastases but often saw multifocal intrahepatic disease in 18 month-old tg 1223 mice. We therefore investigated whether multifocal tg 1223 HCC represented intrahepatic spread of clonal tumors. Independent HCC (n=6) from different lobes of the same tg 1223 liver were micro-dissected and subsequently analyzed by aCGH. All HCC taken from the same liver displayed significantly overlapping chromosomal aberrations throughout the entire genome ( P <0.05), suggesting a clonal relationship of a tumor that has locally spread within the liver ( Figure 6B ). Expression of tumor markers GP73, GS and AFP in tg1223 HCC We then evaluated expression of human liver tumor markers golgi protein 73 (GP73), glutamine synthetase (GS) and ?-fetoprotein (AFP) in tg 1223 livers ( Bachert et al., 2007 ; Marrero and Lok, 2004 ; Sakamoto, 2009 ). GP73, GS and AFP protein expression was elevated in most tg 1223 HCC as detected by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis compared to C57BL/6 livers or unaffected liver regions adjacent to HCC ( Figure 7A–7C ; data not shown). Mechanisms driving LT??-induced chronic hepatitis and liver cancer To identify other receptors and molecular mediators potentially involved in LT-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC development, we intercrossed tg 1223 with Tnfr1 ?/? , Tnfr2 ?/? or Ikk? ?hep mice. The requirement of lymphocytes in chronic hepatitis and HCC formation was investigated by intercrossing with Rag1 ?/? mice, which lack mature lymphocytes. The absence of IKK?, TNFR1 or lymphocytes per se did not appear to influence transgenic Lt? and ? mRNA expression ( Figures 3A and 7D ). Initially, at three months of age, tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep , tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? , tg 1223/ Tnfr2 ?/? and tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? mice lacked histological evidence of hepatitis similar to tg 1223 mice (data not shown). The aberrant hepatic gene expression pattern described for 3 month-old tg 1223 mice developed only partially in tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep and tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? mice, whereas tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? livers displayed an expression profile rather similar to that of tg 1223 mice ( Figure 7D , Figure S7 ). At 9 months of age tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? (n=26) and tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep (n=18) livers lacked hepatitis, hepatocyte or oval-cell proliferation ( Figure S4 ), whereas tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? (n=8) or tg 1223/ Tnfr2 ?/? (n=8) livers were indistinguishable from those of tg 1223 mice ( Figures 7E and 7F , Figure S7 ). At the age of 18 months, tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? (n=26) and tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep (n=25) mice were devoid of hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.0001) ( Figures 5 and 7G ) suggesting that both lymphocytes and hepatocyte-specific IKK? expression are required for LT-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC development. Notably, tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? mice displayed HCC (4/12) with an incidence similar to tg 1223 mice ( Figures 5 and 7G , Figure S8; Table S18 and S19 ) indicating that TNFR1 signaling is not essential for LT-induced HCC formation in tg 1223 mice. Hepatocytes are the major responsive liver cells to agonistic LT?R antibody treatment To investigate whether hepatocytes represent the major LT-responsive liver cells and to investigate LT?R signaling in Tnfr1 ?/? and Ikk? ?hep livers, TNF? (positive control), agonistic LT?R antibody (3C8) and appropriate negative controls (PBS; rat IgG) were administered intravenously (i.v.) to C57BL/6 and various knock-out mice ( Figure 8 , Figure S8 ). Nuclear p65 (RelA) translocation in hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells (NPC: e.g. Kupffer cells, lymphocytes), alterations in the hepatic transcriptome and protein expression of selected chemokines were examined. Administration of 3C8 induced nuclear p65 translocation primarily in hepatocytes and some NPC of C57BL/6 livers ( Figure 8A ), as well as transcriptional changes and upregulation of selected chemokines reminiscent of those observed in 3 month-old tg 1223 livers ( Figure 8A , Figure S9 ). Similar results were obtained after 3C8 treatment of Tnfr1 ?/? mice, in contrast to Ikk? ?hep livers which were devoid of nuclear p65 translocation in hepatocytes and NPC ( Table S20 and S21 ). Furthermore, upregulation of selected NF-?B target genes could not be detected. Control Lt?r ?/? mice treated with 3C8 lacked nuclear p65 translocation in hepatocytes or NPC as well as upregulation of selected NF-?B target genes. To examine whether lack of functional IKK? on hepatocytes and NPC would suppress LT?R induced upregulation of selected NF-?B responsive genes, we investigated livers of mice expressing a non-phosphorylatable IKK? AA knock-in allele ( Ikk? AA/AA ; Cao et al., 2001 ). Upon 3C8 treatment Ikk? AA/AA mice upregulated selected NF-?B responsive genes ( Figure S8 ). The degree of mRNA upregulation in liver was similar to 3C8-treated C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, control treated (rat IgG) Ikk? AA/AA mice lacked upregulation of selected NF-?B responsive genes. This suggests that 3C8-mediated hepatic LT?R signaling is mainly integrated by hepatocytes involving canonical NF-?B pathway. Inhibition of LT?R signaling reduces chronic hepatitis and carcinogenesis We further investigated the involvement of LT?R signaling in the transition of chronic hepatitis to HCC by long-term LT?R-Ig administration in tg 1223 mice. Nine month-old tg 1223 mice with chronic hepatitis (n=31) or age-matched C57BL/6 mice (n=23) were treated with LT?R-Ig for 2 months, remained untreated for another 4 weeks and were then sacrificed. LT?R-Ig treatment significantly reduced chronic hepatitis incidence in tg 1223 mice compared to untreated tg 1223 mice (treated: 4/31; untreated: 34/34; P <0.0001). Furthermore, LT?R-Ig treatment suppressed chronic hepatitis-driven HCC formation (treated: 0/31; untreated: 6/34; P <0.05) ( Figures 5 and 8B ). LT?R-Ig treatment did not lead to overt histopathological alterations in C57BL/6 livers or overt changes in lymphocyte (B-, T-cells) or macrophage populations within spleens of C57BL/6 or tg 1223 mice (data not shown). Efficiency of LT?R-Ig treatment was ascertained by the loss of LT?R-dependent follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) within C57BL/6 and tg 1223 spleens ( Figure S9 ). Thus, our results imply that long-term suppression of LT?R reduces chronic hepatitis incidence and can prevent the transition from chronic hepatitis to HCC in tg 1223 mice.  Results Upregulation of LT?, LT? and LT?R in HBV or HCV infected human livers and in HCC The specific role of LT signaling in the pathogenesis of virus-induced hepatitis and HCC formation is not completely defined. We analyzed transcriptional levels of LT? , LT? , LIGHT , TNF? , LT?R and TNFR1 in human HBV- or HCV-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC or in non-viral HCC compared to healthy liver specimens ( Figure 1 , Figure S1 ). LT? , LT? and LT?R mRNA expression was increased on average ~27 to 210 fold in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.001), LIGHT transcripts were less, but still significantly, elevated (on average ~23 to 25 fold; P <0.001). Likewise, TNFR1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC (on average ~27 to 29 fold; P <0.0001). In contrast, TNF? was only slightly upregulated in HBV-induced hepatitis ( P =0.04) but not in HCV-induced hepatitis ( P =0.3) and HCC ( P =0.4). In most cases, HCV genotype, degree of inflammation (Knodell score), fibrosis (Metavir score) and liver enzyme levels (ALT; AST) were assessed ( Tables S1–S5 ). Levels of LT? , LT? and LT?R mRNA did not correlate with the degree of liver inflammation ( P =0.5), fibrosis ( P =0.5), patient age ( P =0.5), gender ( P =0.5), HCV genotype or type of virus infection (HBV; HCV; HBV/HCV co-infection in the case of some HCC; P =0.5) ( Figure S1 ; data not shown). To determine whether upregulation of LT ligands and receptors was specific for HBV- or HCV-induced liver diseases, we examined transcript levels in non-viral liver diseases. These included liver disorders with hepatitis [alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH); cholestasis (CH); primary biliary cirrhosis/autoimmune cholangitis (PBC); end-stage liver cirrhosis due to alcoholic liver disease (CIR)] and liver diseases without inflammation [steatosis (ST), focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)]. Additionally, other liver diseases (OLD) such as hemochromatosis/siderosis, Wilson’s disease, focal liver fibrosis, ?1-antitrypsin deficiency and non-viral HCC (NVH) were investigated. Levels of LT?, LT? and LT?R mRNA were significantly lower in all non-viral liver diseases analyzed except NVH when compared to virus-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC ( LT?: P <0.0001; LT?: P =0.05; LT?R: P <0.0001; Figure 1 , Figure S1 ). This was irrespective of whether non-viral liver diseases were associated with inflammation. LIGHT and TNFR1 mRNA expression in non-viral liver diseases including NVH was similar to HBV- or HCV-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC. In contrast, TNF? mRNA expression was significantly higher in non-viral liver diseases with inflammation and NVH compared to healthy livers ( P <0.0001), HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.0001). Increased chemokine expression in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC To confirm that pro-inflammatory signaling cascades are activated during HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC formation, chemokine mRNA levels were measured ( Figure S1 ). CCL2, CCL3, CCL5 and CXCL10 mRNA expression was significantly higher in human HBV- ( P <0.0001) or HCV- ( P <0.0001) induced hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.0001) compared to healthy controls. CXCL1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in HBV-induced hepatitis ( P <0.0001) and HCC ( P =0.02) but not in HCV-induced hepatitis ( P =0.07). Upregulation of LT?, LT?, LIGHT in human hepatoyctes upon HCV infection in vitro We next investigated whether LT? , LT? , LIGHT and LT?R transcripts can be upregulated in hepatocytes as a consequence of viral infection. The human hepatocyte cell line Huh-7.5 ( Blight et al., 2002 ) was challenged with infectious HCVcc ( Pietschmann et al., 2006 ) and the expression of cytokines and chemokines was measured ( Figure S2A ). At 48 to 72 hrs post infection, transcripts of LT? ( P =0.05), LT? ( P =0.05), LIGHT ( P =0.05), LT?R ( P =0.05) and chemokines ( CCL2 , CCL3 , CXCL1 and CXCL10 ) were increased (2–32 fold) in HCVcc-infected compared to non-infected Huh-7.5 cells. Identification of liver cells expressing LT?R and its ligands in HBV or HCV infections To identify the cellular source of LT? , LT? , LT?R and LIGHT expression in human HCV-infected livers, cells were collected from HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC ( Figure 2A , Figure S2B ). Liver cells were sorted according to their CD45 surface expression, resulting in CD45-enriched (T-, B-cells; monocytes, macrophages/Kupffer cells; dendritic and NK-cells) or CD45-depleted (hepatocytes, oval cells, bile duct epithelial and endothelial cells) fractions. Purity of these fractions was assessed by real-time PCR for lymphocyte (CD3; CD20; CD45) or hepatocyte (cytokeratin 18) markers. CD45-depleted fractions displayed only a minor contamination with CD45 mRNA (~1–10%) whereas CD45-enriched fractions showed only a minor amount of cytokeratin 18 mRNA transcripts (~2–20%; Figure S2C ; data not shown). Unsorted liver cells of healthy individuals were included as controls. Because of ethical consideration not enough human healthy liver tissue was available in order to perform cell sorting. Within HCV-induced HCC, CD45-enriched and -depleted liver cells expressed similar LT? or LT? mRNA levels (LT?: P =0.8; LT?: P =0.1) that were significantly higher than in controls ( P <0.0001) ( Figure 2A ). LT?R mRNA transcript levels were significantly higher in CD45-depleted cells compared to CD45-enriched cells ( P =0.006), or controls ( P <0.0001). In contrast, LIGHT mRNA expression was significantly increased in CD45-enriched cells when compared to CD45-depleted cells ( P =0.008), or controls ( P =0.0007). Within HCV-induced hepatitis, CD45-enriched cells exhibited a trend towards increased LT? mRNA levels ( P =0.089) and a significant rise in both LT? and LIGHT transcripts compared to CD45-depleted cells ( LT?: P =0.006; LIGHT: P =0.01), or controls. Similar to HCV-induced HCC, LT?R mRNA expression was significantly higher in CD45-depleted cells compared to CD45-enriched cells ( P =0.002), or controls ( P <0.0001). Thus, both CD45-enriched and CD45-depleted cell fractions express LT? , LT? and LIGHT in HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC. Immunohistochemical analysis for LT? protein expression corroborated these data: CD3+, CD20+ lymphocytes and hepatocytes in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC, but not those in healthy liver specimens, express LT? protein ( Figure 2C ). Hepatocyte-specific LT? and ? overexpression induces chronic progressive hepatitis To determine whether sustained hepatic LT?R signaling is causally linked to chronic hepatitis and liver cancer, we analyzed two transgenic mouse lines that expressed LT? and ? in a liver specific manner at low ( tg 1222) or high ( tg 1223) level ( Heikenwalder et al., 2005 ). Although livers of tg 1222 and tg 1223 mice were histologically indistinguishable from those of control littermates at three months of age ( Figure S3 ), the hepatic transcriptome was already considerably altered in tg 1223 and to a lesser degree in tg 1222 mice ( Figure 3A ; data not shown). Genes with the most dramatic expression changes were identified by DNA-microarray analysis and confirmed by real-time PCR ( Figure 3A ). As expected, Lt? and Lt? transcripts were increased in tg 1222 and tg 1223 livers ( Figure 3A ; data not shown). Additionally, mRNA expression of chemokines ( Ccl2 , Ccl7, Cxcl1 , Cxcl10 ) , genes involved in early growth response (e.g. Egr1 , Egr2 ), cholesterol metabolism (e.g. Ch25h ) and immediate early response (e.g. c-Fos, Jun-b, Socs-3 ) were significantly ( P <0.0001) elevated. In contrast, genes involved in cell cycle control, histone modifications and cell metabolism were significantly downregulated ( P <0.0001) ( Figure 3A ; Tables S6–S8, Figure S4 ). In situ hybridization revealed Lt? , Lt? , Cxcl10, Ccl2 and Egr1 mRNA transcripts in hepatocytes of 3 months old tg 1223 ( Figure 3B , Figure S3 ). At the age of 4 months a slight increase in intrahepatic CD11b+, CD68+ and MHCII+ cells was detected in tg 1223 mice compared to age-matched tg 1222 or C57BL/6 mice ( Figure S3 ; data not shown). At this time point, no significant increase in IL1?, IFN?, IL6 and TNF? protein levels was found (data not shown). At 4–6 months transgenic livers started to develop strong portal and lobular ( tg 1223) or weak portal ( tg 1222) inflammation consisting of CD4+, CD8+ T-cells, B220+ B-cells and CD11c+ dendritic cells ( Figure S3 ; Heikenwalder et al., 2005 ). At ? 9 months of age, tg 1223 livers exhibited strong portal and lobular lymphocytic infiltrates ( Figure 3C ). A pronounced influx of F4/80+ macrophages and proliferation of A6+ oval cells was observed. Chronic inflammation coincided with increased proliferating Ki67+ hepatocytes ( tg 1223: 17±5 Ki67+cells/mm2 liver section; C57BL/6: 0.5±0.3 Ki67+cells/mm2 liver section; P =0.003), which was not significant in age-matched tg 1222 livers ( P =0.08; Figure 3C ; data not shown). At this stage, hepatitis was accompanied by increased protein levels of IL1? ( P =0.05), IFN? ( P =0.05) and IL6 ( P =0.05) and, to a lesser degree, of TNF? in tg 1223 livers. In tg 1222 livers we observed only a slight elevation of these cytokines compared to C57BL/6 ( Figure 3D ). Quantitative analysis of total intrahepatic lymphocytes revealed an increase in tg 1223 livers (C57BL/6: 17–24×106 cells/liver; tg 1223: 35–73×106 cells/liver P <0.05). Intrahepatic lymphocytes were further characterized by flow cytometry ( Figure 3E ). Frequencies of CD8+ (C57BL/6: 18±11%; tg 1223: 38±10%), CD4+ (C57BL/6: 16±3%; tg 1223: 26±6%) and TCR?+ T-cells (C57BL/6: 33.5±9%; tg 1223: 63.5±4%) were elevated (n=4), while NK1.1+ cells (C57BL/6: 12±2%; tg 1223: 7±2%) were reduced in tg 1223 livers. Furthermore, an increase in the frequency of CD19+ B-cells was found in tg 1223 livers (C57BL/6: 25±7%; tg 1223: 52±4%). Elevated frequencies of IFN?-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were found in tg 1223 mice, while IL17-producing cells remained unchanged ( Figure 3E ; data not shown). LT? and LT? overexpression induces hepatotoxicity To determine whether chronic hepatitis leads to hepatocyte cell death in tg 1222 or tg 1223 mice, we analyzed serum transaminase levels (ALT and AST). From the age of 19 weeks on, serum ALT and AST levels were significantly elevated ( P =0.05) in tg 1223 but not in tg 1222 mice ( Figure 4A ) and apoptotic hepatocytes were frequently detected in tg 1223 mice ( tg 1223: 40.3±11.4 TUNEL+cells/mm2 liver section; C57BL/6: 3.9±6.2 TUNEL+cells/mm2 liver section; P =0.0005) but rarely in tg 1222 and virtually absent in C57BL/6 mouse livers from the age of 6 months on ( Figure 4B , Figure S5 ; data not shown for tg 1222). Hepatitis persisted in both transgenic lines for 18 months. Phenotypes were much milder in tg 1222 mice, implying that the LT expression level determined the severity of inflammation and liver injury. Therefore, tg 1223 mice were selected for additional experiments and further key results were obtained from this mouse line. Microarray and real-time PCR analyses revealed elevated mRNA expression of genes involved in embryogenesis (e.g. Dmrta1 ), liver inflammation (e.g. Pbfe1 ), carcinogenesis (e.g. Phlda3, Thrsp ; Kawase et al., 2009 ), glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (e.g. Fgf21 ) and reduced mRNA expression of genes responsible for cell cycle control ( Gadd45g ) and protease inhibition ( SerpinA9 ) in nine month-old tg 1223 livers compared to C57BL/6 livers ( Figure S5; Tables S9–S11 ). Several genes strongly up- or downregulated in 3 month-old tg 1223 livers ( Figure 3A ) returned to normal levels at 9 months, except that Lt? and ? mRNAs remained at high levels. On the other hand, genes involved in cell division, liver inflammation, lipid metabolism, wound healing and tumorigenesis were significantly upregulated ( P <0.001) whereas genes involved in growth arrest and apoptosis were significantly downregulated ( P <0.001) in 9 month-old compared to 3 month-old tg 1223 livers ( Figure S5; Tables S12–S17 ). HCC development in tg1223 mice At 12 months of age, about 20% (6/34) of tg 1223 mice developed macroscopically visible nodules that classified histologically as HCC, including broadening of liver cell cords, loss of collagen IV networks and increased proliferative activity. In contrast, age-matched C57BL/6 livers lacked HCC (0/20; P =0.05) ( Figures 4C, 4D , and 5 ). Tumor frequency increased with age reaching ~35% (18/51) by 18 months, whereas C57BL/6 mice did not develop HCC (0/35; P <0.0001) ( Figure 5 , Figure S6 ). Tumors varied in size (1–25mm), histology and affected both genders with similar frequencies (males:females = 13:11; P =0.3) ( Figure 4 ; Tables S18 and S19 ). A6+ oval cells ( Engelhardt et al., 1990 ) were focally (8/24) or diffusely (2/24) distributed within some tg 1223 HCC. The remaining tg 1223 HCC (14/24) lacked A6+ cells but were surrounded by them at the border zone of HCC ( Figure S6 ). Chromosomal aberrations and local spread of HCC in tg1223 mice We further investigated micro-dissected tg 1223 HCC (n=9) and age-matched C57BL/6 livers (n=5) for chromosomal aberrations. Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis (aCGH) revealed chromosomal aberrations in all tg 1223 HCC ( Figure 6 ). Amplifications and deletions of chromosomal regions ranged from ? 1 mega-base (MB) to 160 MB and were detected in most autosomes of all analyzed tg 1223 HCC. Of note, the pattern of chromosomal aberrations varied in HCC from different individual tg 1223 mice ( P =0.34). aCGH analysis of independent C57BL/6 liver DNA samples did not reveal significant chromosomal aberrations. We did not detect lung metastases but often saw multifocal intrahepatic disease in 18 month-old tg 1223 mice. We therefore investigated whether multifocal tg 1223 HCC represented intrahepatic spread of clonal tumors. Independent HCC (n=6) from different lobes of the same tg 1223 liver were micro-dissected and subsequently analyzed by aCGH. All HCC taken from the same liver displayed significantly overlapping chromosomal aberrations throughout the entire genome ( P <0.05), suggesting a clonal relationship of a tumor that has locally spread within the liver ( Figure 6B ). Expression of tumor markers GP73, GS and AFP in tg1223 HCC We then evaluated expression of human liver tumor markers golgi protein 73 (GP73), glutamine synthetase (GS) and ?-fetoprotein (AFP) in tg 1223 livers ( Bachert et al., 2007 ; Marrero and Lok, 2004 ; Sakamoto, 2009 ). GP73, GS and AFP protein expression was elevated in most tg 1223 HCC as detected by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis compared to C57BL/6 livers or unaffected liver regions adjacent to HCC ( Figure 7A–7C ; data not shown). Mechanisms driving LT??-induced chronic hepatitis and liver cancer To identify other receptors and molecular mediators potentially involved in LT-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC development, we intercrossed tg 1223 with Tnfr1 ?/? , Tnfr2 ?/? or Ikk? ?hep mice. The requirement of lymphocytes in chronic hepatitis and HCC formation was investigated by intercrossing with Rag1 ?/? mice, which lack mature lymphocytes. The absence of IKK?, TNFR1 or lymphocytes per se did not appear to influence transgenic Lt? and ? mRNA expression ( Figures 3A and 7D ). Initially, at three months of age, tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep , tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? , tg 1223/ Tnfr2 ?/? and tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? mice lacked histological evidence of hepatitis similar to tg 1223 mice (data not shown). The aberrant hepatic gene expression pattern described for 3 month-old tg 1223 mice developed only partially in tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep and tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? mice, whereas tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? livers displayed an expression profile rather similar to that of tg 1223 mice ( Figure 7D , Figure S7 ). At 9 months of age tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? (n=26) and tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep (n=18) livers lacked hepatitis, hepatocyte or oval-cell proliferation ( Figure S4 ), whereas tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? (n=8) or tg 1223/ Tnfr2 ?/? (n=8) livers were indistinguishable from those of tg 1223 mice ( Figures 7E and 7F , Figure S7 ). At the age of 18 months, tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? (n=26) and tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep (n=25) mice were devoid of hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.0001) ( Figures 5 and 7G ) suggesting that both lymphocytes and hepatocyte-specific IKK? expression are required for LT-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC development. Notably, tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? mice displayed HCC (4/12) with an incidence similar to tg 1223 mice ( Figures 5 and 7G , Figure S8; Table S18 and S19 ) indicating that TNFR1 signaling is not essential for LT-induced HCC formation in tg 1223 mice. Hepatocytes are the major responsive liver cells to agonistic LT?R antibody treatment To investigate whether hepatocytes represent the major LT-responsive liver cells and to investigate LT?R signaling in Tnfr1 ?/? and Ikk? ?hep livers, TNF? (positive control), agonistic LT?R antibody (3C8) and appropriate negative controls (PBS; rat IgG) were administered intravenously (i.v.) to C57BL/6 and various knock-out mice ( Figure 8 , Figure S8 ). Nuclear p65 (RelA) translocation in hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells (NPC: e.g. Kupffer cells, lymphocytes), alterations in the hepatic transcriptome and protein expression of selected chemokines were examined. Administration of 3C8 induced nuclear p65 translocation primarily in hepatocytes and some NPC of C57BL/6 livers ( Figure 8A ), as well as transcriptional changes and upregulation of selected chemokines reminiscent of those observed in 3 month-old tg 1223 livers ( Figure 8A , Figure S9 ). Similar results were obtained after 3C8 treatment of Tnfr1 ?/? mice, in contrast to Ikk? ?hep livers which were devoid of nuclear p65 translocation in hepatocytes and NPC ( Table S20 and S21 ). Furthermore, upregulation of selected NF-?B target genes could not be detected. Control Lt?r ?/? mice treated with 3C8 lacked nuclear p65 translocation in hepatocytes or NPC as well as upregulation of selected NF-?B target genes. To examine whether lack of functional IKK? on hepatocytes and NPC would suppress LT?R induced upregulation of selected NF-?B responsive genes, we investigated livers of mice expressing a non-phosphorylatable IKK? AA knock-in allele ( Ikk? AA/AA ; Cao et al., 2001 ). Upon 3C8 treatment Ikk? AA/AA mice upregulated selected NF-?B responsive genes ( Figure S8 ). The degree of mRNA upregulation in liver was similar to 3C8-treated C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, control treated (rat IgG) Ikk? AA/AA mice lacked upregulation of selected NF-?B responsive genes. This suggests that 3C8-mediated hepatic LT?R signaling is mainly integrated by hepatocytes involving canonical NF-?B pathway. Inhibition of LT?R signaling reduces chronic hepatitis and carcinogenesis We further investigated the involvement of LT?R signaling in the transition of chronic hepatitis to HCC by long-term LT?R-Ig administration in tg 1223 mice. Nine month-old tg 1223 mice with chronic hepatitis (n=31) or age-matched C57BL/6 mice (n=23) were treated with LT?R-Ig for 2 months, remained untreated for another 4 weeks and were then sacrificed. LT?R-Ig treatment significantly reduced chronic hepatitis incidence in tg 1223 mice compared to untreated tg 1223 mice (treated: 4/31; untreated: 34/34; P <0.0001). Furthermore, LT?R-Ig treatment suppressed chronic hepatitis-driven HCC formation (treated: 0/31; untreated: 6/34; P <0.05) ( Figures 5 and 8B ). LT?R-Ig treatment did not lead to overt histopathological alterations in C57BL/6 livers or overt changes in lymphocyte (B-, T-cells) or macrophage populations within spleens of C57BL/6 or tg 1223 mice (data not shown). Efficiency of LT?R-Ig treatment was ascertained by the loss of LT?R-dependent follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) within C57BL/6 and tg 1223 spleens ( Figure S9 ). Thus, our results imply that long-term suppression of LT?R reduces chronic hepatitis incidence and can prevent the transition from chronic hepatitis to HCC in tg 1223 mice.  Upregulation of LT?, LT? and LT?R in HBV or HCV infected human livers and in HCC The specific role of LT signaling in the pathogenesis of virus-induced hepatitis and HCC formation is not completely defined. We analyzed transcriptional levels of LT? , LT? , LIGHT , TNF? , LT?R and TNFR1 in human HBV- or HCV-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC or in non-viral HCC compared to healthy liver specimens ( Figure 1 , Figure S1 ). LT? , LT? and LT?R mRNA expression was increased on average ~27 to 210 fold in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.001), LIGHT transcripts were less, but still significantly, elevated (on average ~23 to 25 fold; P <0.001). Likewise, TNFR1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC (on average ~27 to 29 fold; P <0.0001). In contrast, TNF? was only slightly upregulated in HBV-induced hepatitis ( P =0.04) but not in HCV-induced hepatitis ( P =0.3) and HCC ( P =0.4). In most cases, HCV genotype, degree of inflammation (Knodell score), fibrosis (Metavir score) and liver enzyme levels (ALT; AST) were assessed ( Tables S1–S5 ). Levels of LT? , LT? and LT?R mRNA did not correlate with the degree of liver inflammation ( P =0.5), fibrosis ( P =0.5), patient age ( P =0.5), gender ( P =0.5), HCV genotype or type of virus infection (HBV; HCV; HBV/HCV co-infection in the case of some HCC; P =0.5) ( Figure S1 ; data not shown). To determine whether upregulation of LT ligands and receptors was specific for HBV- or HCV-induced liver diseases, we examined transcript levels in non-viral liver diseases. These included liver disorders with hepatitis [alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH); cholestasis (CH); primary biliary cirrhosis/autoimmune cholangitis (PBC); end-stage liver cirrhosis due to alcoholic liver disease (CIR)] and liver diseases without inflammation [steatosis (ST), focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)]. Additionally, other liver diseases (OLD) such as hemochromatosis/siderosis, Wilson’s disease, focal liver fibrosis, ?1-antitrypsin deficiency and non-viral HCC (NVH) were investigated. Levels of LT?, LT? and LT?R mRNA were significantly lower in all non-viral liver diseases analyzed except NVH when compared to virus-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC ( LT?: P <0.0001; LT?: P =0.05; LT?R: P <0.0001; Figure 1 , Figure S1 ). This was irrespective of whether non-viral liver diseases were associated with inflammation. LIGHT and TNFR1 mRNA expression in non-viral liver diseases including NVH was similar to HBV- or HCV-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC. In contrast, TNF? mRNA expression was significantly higher in non-viral liver diseases with inflammation and NVH compared to healthy livers ( P <0.0001), HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.0001).  Upregulation of LT?, LT? and LT?R in HBV or HCV infected human livers and in HCC The specific role of LT signaling in the pathogenesis of virus-induced hepatitis and HCC formation is not completely defined. We analyzed transcriptional levels of LT? , LT? , LIGHT , TNF? , LT?R and TNFR1 in human HBV- or HCV-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC or in non-viral HCC compared to healthy liver specimens ( Figure 1 , Figure S1 ). LT? , LT? and LT?R mRNA expression was increased on average ~27 to 210 fold in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.001), LIGHT transcripts were less, but still significantly, elevated (on average ~23 to 25 fold; P <0.001). Likewise, TNFR1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC (on average ~27 to 29 fold; P <0.0001). In contrast, TNF? was only slightly upregulated in HBV-induced hepatitis ( P =0.04) but not in HCV-induced hepatitis ( P =0.3) and HCC ( P =0.4). In most cases, HCV genotype, degree of inflammation (Knodell score), fibrosis (Metavir score) and liver enzyme levels (ALT; AST) were assessed ( Tables S1–S5 ). Levels of LT? , LT? and LT?R mRNA did not correlate with the degree of liver inflammation ( P =0.5), fibrosis ( P =0.5), patient age ( P =0.5), gender ( P =0.5), HCV genotype or type of virus infection (HBV; HCV; HBV/HCV co-infection in the case of some HCC; P =0.5) ( Figure S1 ; data not shown). To determine whether upregulation of LT ligands and receptors was specific for HBV- or HCV-induced liver diseases, we examined transcript levels in non-viral liver diseases. These included liver disorders with hepatitis [alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH); cholestasis (CH); primary biliary cirrhosis/autoimmune cholangitis (PBC); end-stage liver cirrhosis due to alcoholic liver disease (CIR)] and liver diseases without inflammation [steatosis (ST), focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)]. Additionally, other liver diseases (OLD) such as hemochromatosis/siderosis, Wilson’s disease, focal liver fibrosis, ?1-antitrypsin deficiency and non-viral HCC (NVH) were investigated. Levels of LT?, LT? and LT?R mRNA were significantly lower in all non-viral liver diseases analyzed except NVH when compared to virus-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC ( LT?: P <0.0001; LT?: P =0.05; LT?R: P <0.0001; Figure 1 , Figure S1 ). This was irrespective of whether non-viral liver diseases were associated with inflammation. LIGHT and TNFR1 mRNA expression in non-viral liver diseases including NVH was similar to HBV- or HCV-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC. In contrast, TNF? mRNA expression was significantly higher in non-viral liver diseases with inflammation and NVH compared to healthy livers ( P <0.0001), HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.0001).  Increased chemokine expression in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC To confirm that pro-inflammatory signaling cascades are activated during HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC formation, chemokine mRNA levels were measured ( Figure S1 ). CCL2, CCL3, CCL5 and CXCL10 mRNA expression was significantly higher in human HBV- ( P <0.0001) or HCV- ( P <0.0001) induced hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.0001) compared to healthy controls. CXCL1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in HBV-induced hepatitis ( P <0.0001) and HCC ( P =0.02) but not in HCV-induced hepatitis ( P =0.07).  Increased chemokine expression in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC To confirm that pro-inflammatory signaling cascades are activated during HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC formation, chemokine mRNA levels were measured ( Figure S1 ). CCL2, CCL3, CCL5 and CXCL10 mRNA expression was significantly higher in human HBV- ( P <0.0001) or HCV- ( P <0.0001) induced hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.0001) compared to healthy controls. CXCL1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in HBV-induced hepatitis ( P <0.0001) and HCC ( P =0.02) but not in HCV-induced hepatitis ( P =0.07).  Upregulation of LT?, LT?, LIGHT in human hepatoyctes upon HCV infection in vitro We next investigated whether LT? , LT? , LIGHT and LT?R transcripts can be upregulated in hepatocytes as a consequence of viral infection. The human hepatocyte cell line Huh-7.5 ( Blight et al., 2002 ) was challenged with infectious HCVcc ( Pietschmann et al., 2006 ) and the expression of cytokines and chemokines was measured ( Figure S2A ). At 48 to 72 hrs post infection, transcripts of LT? ( P =0.05), LT? ( P =0.05), LIGHT ( P =0.05), LT?R ( P =0.05) and chemokines ( CCL2 , CCL3 , CXCL1 and CXCL10 ) were increased (2–32 fold) in HCVcc-infected compared to non-infected Huh-7.5 cells.  Upregulation of LT?, LT?, LIGHT in human hepatoyctes upon HCV infection in vitro We next investigated whether LT? , LT? , LIGHT and LT?R transcripts can be upregulated in hepatocytes as a consequence of viral infection. The human hepatocyte cell line Huh-7.5 ( Blight et al., 2002 ) was challenged with infectious HCVcc ( Pietschmann et al., 2006 ) and the expression of cytokines and chemokines was measured ( Figure S2A ). At 48 to 72 hrs post infection, transcripts of LT? ( P =0.05), LT? ( P =0.05), LIGHT ( P =0.05), LT?R ( P =0.05) and chemokines ( CCL2 , CCL3 , CXCL1 and CXCL10 ) were increased (2–32 fold) in HCVcc-infected compared to non-infected Huh-7.5 cells.  Identification of liver cells expressing LT?R and its ligands in HBV or HCV infections To identify the cellular source of LT? , LT? , LT?R and LIGHT expression in human HCV-infected livers, cells were collected from HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC ( Figure 2A , Figure S2B ). Liver cells were sorted according to their CD45 surface expression, resulting in CD45-enriched (T-, B-cells; monocytes, macrophages/Kupffer cells; dendritic and NK-cells) or CD45-depleted (hepatocytes, oval cells, bile duct epithelial and endothelial cells) fractions. Purity of these fractions was assessed by real-time PCR for lymphocyte (CD3; CD20; CD45) or hepatocyte (cytokeratin 18) markers. CD45-depleted fractions displayed only a minor contamination with CD45 mRNA (~1–10%) whereas CD45-enriched fractions showed only a minor amount of cytokeratin 18 mRNA transcripts (~2–20%; Figure S2C ; data not shown). Unsorted liver cells of healthy individuals were included as controls. Because of ethical consideration not enough human healthy liver tissue was available in order to perform cell sorting. Within HCV-induced HCC, CD45-enriched and -depleted liver cells expressed similar LT? or LT? mRNA levels (LT?: P =0.8; LT?: P =0.1) that were significantly higher than in controls ( P <0.0001) ( Figure 2A ). LT?R mRNA transcript levels were significantly higher in CD45-depleted cells compared to CD45-enriched cells ( P =0.006), or controls ( P <0.0001). In contrast, LIGHT mRNA expression was significantly increased in CD45-enriched cells when compared to CD45-depleted cells ( P =0.008), or controls ( P =0.0007). Within HCV-induced hepatitis, CD45-enriched cells exhibited a trend towards increased LT? mRNA levels ( P =0.089) and a significant rise in both LT? and LIGHT transcripts compared to CD45-depleted cells ( LT?: P =0.006; LIGHT: P =0.01), or controls. Similar to HCV-induced HCC, LT?R mRNA expression was significantly higher in CD45-depleted cells compared to CD45-enriched cells ( P =0.002), or controls ( P <0.0001). Thus, both CD45-enriched and CD45-depleted cell fractions express LT? , LT? and LIGHT in HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC. Immunohistochemical analysis for LT? protein expression corroborated these data: CD3+, CD20+ lymphocytes and hepatocytes in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC, but not those in healthy liver specimens, express LT? protein ( Figure 2C ).  Identification of liver cells expressing LT?R and its ligands in HBV or HCV infections To identify the cellular source of LT? , LT? , LT?R and LIGHT expression in human HCV-infected livers, cells were collected from HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC ( Figure 2A , Figure S2B ). Liver cells were sorted according to their CD45 surface expression, resulting in CD45-enriched (T-, B-cells; monocytes, macrophages/Kupffer cells; dendritic and NK-cells) or CD45-depleted (hepatocytes, oval cells, bile duct epithelial and endothelial cells) fractions.

Unsorted liver cells of healthy individuals were included as controls. Because of ethical consideration not enough human healthy liver tissue was available in order to perform cell sorting. Within HCV-induced HCC, CD45-enriched and -depleted liver cells expressed similar LT? or LT? mRNA levels (LT?: P =0.8; LT?: P =0.1) that were significantly higher than in controls ( P <0.0001) ( Figure 2A ). LT?R mRNA transcript levels were significantly higher in CD45-depleted cells compared to CD45-enriched cells ( P =0.006), or controls ( P <0.0001). In contrast, LIGHT mRNA expression was significantly increased in CD45-enriched cells when compared to CD45-depleted cells ( P =0.008), or controls ( P =0.0007). Within HCV-induced hepatitis, CD45-enriched cells exhibited a trend towards increased LT? mRNA levels ( P =0.089) and a significant rise in both LT? and LIGHT transcripts compared to CD45-depleted cells ( LT?: P =0.006; LIGHT: P =0.01), or controls. Similar to HCV-induced HCC, LT?R mRNA expression was significantly higher in CD45-depleted cells compared to CD45-enriched cells ( P =0.002), or controls ( P <0.0001). Thus, both CD45-enriched and CD45-depleted cell fractions express LT? , LT? and LIGHT in HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC. Immunohistochemical analysis for LT? protein expression corroborated these data: CD3+, CD20+ lymphocytes and hepatocytes in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC, but not those in healthy liver specimens, express LT? protein ( Figure 2C ).  Hepatocyte-specific LT? and ? overexpression induces chronic progressive hepatitis To determine whether sustained hepatic LT?R signaling is causally linked to chronic hepatitis and liver cancer, we analyzed two transgenic mouse lines that expressed LT? and ? in a liver specific manner at low ( tg 1222) or high ( tg 1223) level ( Heikenwalder et al., 2005 ). Although livers of tg 1222 and tg 1223 mice were histologically indistinguishable from those of control littermates at three months of age ( Figure S3 ), the hepatic transcriptome was already considerably altered in tg 1223 and to a lesser degree in tg 1222 mice ( Figure 3A ; data not shown). Genes with the most dramatic expression changes were identified by DNA-microarray analysis and confirmed by real-time PCR ( Figure 3A ). As expected, Lt? and Lt? transcripts were increased in tg 1222 and tg 1223 livers ( Figure 3A ; data not shown). Additionally, mRNA expression of chemokines ( Ccl2 , Ccl7, Cxcl1 , Cxcl10 ) , genes involved in early growth response (e.g. Egr1 , Egr2 ), cholesterol metabolism (e.g. Ch25h ) and immediate early response (e.g. c-Fos, Jun-b, Socs-3 ) were significantly ( P <0.0001) elevated. In contrast, genes involved in cell cycle control, histone modifications and cell metabolism were significantly downregulated ( P <0.0001) ( Figure 3A ; Tables S6–S8, Figure S4 ). In situ hybridization revealed Lt? , Lt? , Cxcl10, Ccl2 and Egr1 mRNA transcripts in hepatocytes of 3 months old tg 1223 ( Figure 3B , Figure S3 ). At the age of 4 months a slight increase in intrahepatic CD11b+, CD68+ and MHCII+ cells was detected in tg 1223 mice compared to age-matched tg 1222 or C57BL/6 mice ( Figure S3 ; data not shown). At this time point, no significant increase in IL1?, IFN?, IL6 and TNF? protein levels was found (data not shown). At 4–6 months transgenic livers started to develop strong portal and lobular ( tg 1223) or weak portal ( tg 1222) inflammation consisting of CD4+, CD8+ T-cells, B220+ B-cells and CD11c+ dendritic cells ( Figure S3 ; Heikenwalder et al., 2005 ). At ? 9 months of age, tg 1223 livers exhibited strong portal and lobular lymphocytic infiltrates ( Figure 3C ). A pronounced influx of F4/80+ macrophages and proliferation of A6+ oval cells was observed. Chronic inflammation coincided with increased proliferating Ki67+ hepatocytes ( tg 1223: 17±5 Ki67+cells/mm2 liver section; C57BL/6: 0.5±0.3 Ki67+cells/mm2 liver section; P =0.003), which was not significant in age-matched tg 1222 livers ( P =0.08; Figure 3C ; data not shown). At this stage, hepatitis was accompanied by increased protein levels of IL1? ( P =0.05), IFN? ( P =0.05) and IL6 ( P =0.05) and, to a lesser degree, of TNF? in tg 1223 livers. In tg 1222 livers we observed only a slight elevation of these cytokines compared to C57BL/6 ( Figure 3D ). Quantitative analysis of total intrahepatic lymphocytes revealed an increase in tg 1223 livers (C57BL/6: 17–24×106 cells/liver; tg 1223: 35–73×106 cells/liver P <0.05). Intrahepatic lymphocytes were further characterized by flow cytometry ( Figure 3E ). Frequencies of CD8+ (C57BL/6: 18±11%; tg 1223: 38±10%), CD4+ (C57BL/6: 16±3%; tg 1223: 26±6%) and TCR?+ T-cells (C57BL/6: 33.5±9%; tg 1223: 63.5±4%) were elevated (n=4), while NK1.1+ cells (C57BL/6: 12±2%; tg 1223: 7±2%) were reduced in tg 1223 livers. Furthermore, an increase in the frequency of CD19+ B-cells was found in tg 1223 livers (C57BL/6: 25±7%; tg 1223: 52±4%). Elevated frequencies of IFN?-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were found in tg 1223 mice, while IL17-producing cells remained unchanged ( Figure 3E ; data not shown).  Hepatocyte-specific LT? and ? overexpression induces chronic progressive hepatitis To determine whether sustained hepatic LT?R signaling is causally linked to chronic hepatitis and liver cancer, we analyzed two transgenic mouse lines that expressed LT? and ? in a liver specific manner at low ( tg 1222) or high ( tg 1223) level ( Heikenwalder et al., 2005 ).

In contrast, genes involved in cell cycle control, histone modifications and cell metabolism were significantly downregulated ( P <0.0001) ( Figure 3A ; Tables S6–S8, Figure S4 ).

Intrahepatic lymphocytes were further characterized by flow cytometry ( Figure 3E ). Frequencies of CD8+ (C57BL/6: 18±11%; tg 1223: 38±10%), CD4+ (C57BL/6: 16±3%; tg 1223: 26±6%) and TCR?+ T-cells (C57BL/6: 33.5±9%; tg 1223: 63.5±4%) were elevated (n=4), while NK1.1+ cells (C57BL/6: 12±2%; tg 1223: 7±2%) were reduced in tg 1223 livers.

Elevated frequencies of IFN?-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were found in tg 1223 mice, while IL17-producing cells remained unchanged ( Figure 3E ; data not shown).  LT? and LT? overexpression induces hepatotoxicity To determine whether chronic hepatitis leads to hepatocyte cell death in tg 1222 or tg 1223 mice, we analyzed serum transaminase levels (ALT and AST). From the age of 19 weeks on, serum ALT and AST levels were significantly elevated ( P =0.05) in tg 1223 but not in tg 1222 mice ( Figure 4A ) and apoptotic hepatocytes were frequently detected in tg 1223 mice ( tg 1223: 40.3±11.4 TUNEL+cells/mm2 liver section; C57BL/6: 3.9±6.2 TUNEL+cells/mm2 liver section; P =0.0005) but rarely in tg 1222 and virtually absent in C57BL/6 mouse livers from the age of 6 months on ( Figure 4B , Figure S5 ; data not shown for tg 1222). Hepatitis persisted in both transgenic lines for 18 months. Phenotypes were much milder in tg 1222 mice, implying that the LT expression level determined the severity of inflammation and liver injury. Therefore, tg 1223 mice were selected for additional experiments and further key results were obtained from this mouse line. Microarray and real-time PCR analyses revealed elevated mRNA expression of genes involved in embryogenesis (e.g. Dmrta1 ), liver inflammation (e.g. Pbfe1 ), carcinogenesis (e.g. Phlda3, Thrsp ; Kawase et al., 2009 ), glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (e.g. Fgf21 ) and reduced mRNA expression of genes responsible for cell cycle control ( Gadd45g ) and protease inhibition ( SerpinA9 ) in nine month-old tg 1223 livers compared to C57BL/6 livers ( Figure S5; Tables S9–S11 ). Several genes strongly up- or downregulated in 3 month-old tg 1223 livers ( Figure 3A ) returned to normal levels at 9 months, except that Lt? and ? mRNAs remained at high levels. On the other hand, genes involved in cell division, liver inflammation, lipid metabolism, wound healing and tumorigenesis were significantly upregulated ( P <0.001) whereas genes involved in growth arrest and apoptosis were significantly downregulated ( P <0.001) in 9 month-old compared to 3 month-old tg 1223 livers ( Figure S5; Tables S12–S17 ).  LT? and LT? overexpression induces hepatotoxicity To determine whether chronic hepatitis leads to hepatocyte cell death in tg 1222 or tg 1223 mice, we analyzed serum transaminase levels (ALT and AST). From the age of 19 weeks on, serum ALT and AST levels were significantly elevated ( P =0.05) in tg 1223 but not in tg 1222 mice ( Figure 4A ) and apoptotic hepatocytes were frequently detected in tg 1223 mice ( tg 1223: 40.3±11.4 TUNEL+cells/mm2 liver section; C57BL/6: 3.9±6.2 TUNEL+cells/mm2 liver section; P =0.0005) but rarely in tg 1222 and virtually absent in C57BL/6 mouse livers from the age of 6 months on ( Figure 4B , Figure S5 ; data not shown for tg 1222).

On the other hand, genes involved in cell division, liver inflammation, lipid metabolism, wound healing and tumorigenesis were significantly upregulated ( P <0.001) whereas genes involved in growth arrest and apoptosis were significantly downregulated ( P <0.001) in 9 month-old compared to 3 month-old tg 1223 livers ( Figure S5; Tables S12–S17 ).  HCC development in tg1223 mice At 12 months of age, about 20% (6/34) of tg 1223 mice developed macroscopically visible nodules that classified histologically as HCC, including broadening of liver cell cords, loss of collagen IV networks and increased proliferative activity. In contrast, age-matched C57BL/6 livers lacked HCC (0/20; P =0.05) ( Figures 4C, 4D , and 5 ). Tumor frequency increased with age reaching ~35% (18/51) by 18 months, whereas C57BL/6 mice did not develop HCC (0/35; P <0.0001) ( Figure 5 , Figure S6 ). Tumors varied in size (1–25mm), histology and affected both genders with similar frequencies (males:females = 13:11; P =0.3) ( Figure 4 ; Tables S18 and S19 ). A6+ oval cells ( Engelhardt et al., 1990 ) were focally (8/24) or diffusely (2/24) distributed within some tg 1223 HCC. The remaining tg 1223 HCC (14/24) lacked A6+ cells but were surrounded by them at the border zone of HCC ( Figure S6 ).  HCC development in tg1223 mice At 12 months of age, about 20% (6/34) of tg 1223 mice developed macroscopically visible nodules that classified histologically as HCC, including broadening of liver cell cords, loss of collagen IV networks and increased proliferative activity.

The remaining tg 1223 HCC (14/24) lacked A6+ cells but were surrounded by them at the border zone of HCC ( Figure S6 ).  Chromosomal aberrations and local spread of HCC in tg1223 mice We further investigated micro-dissected tg 1223 HCC (n=9) and age-matched C57BL/6 livers (n=5) for chromosomal aberrations. Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis (aCGH) revealed chromosomal aberrations in all tg 1223 HCC ( Figure 6 ). Amplifications and deletions of chromosomal regions ranged from ? 1 mega-base (MB) to 160 MB and were detected in most autosomes of all analyzed tg 1223 HCC. Of note, the pattern of chromosomal aberrations varied in HCC from different individual tg 1223 mice ( P =0.34). aCGH analysis of independent C57BL/6 liver DNA samples did not reveal significant chromosomal aberrations. We did not detect lung metastases but often saw multifocal intrahepatic disease in 18 month-old tg 1223 mice. We therefore investigated whether multifocal tg 1223 HCC represented intrahepatic spread of clonal tumors. Independent HCC (n=6) from different lobes of the same tg 1223 liver were micro-dissected and subsequently analyzed by aCGH. All HCC taken from the same liver displayed significantly overlapping chromosomal aberrations throughout the entire genome ( P <0.05), suggesting a clonal relationship of a tumor that has locally spread within the liver ( Figure 6B ).

Expression of tumor markers GP73, GS and AFP in tg1223 HCC We then evaluated expression of human liver tumor markers golgi protein 73 (GP73), glutamine synthetase (GS) and ?-fetoprotein (AFP) in tg 1223 livers ( Bachert et al., 2007 ; Marrero and Lok, 2004 ; Sakamoto, 2009 ). GP73, GS and AFP protein expression was elevated in most tg 1223 HCC as detected by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis compared to C57BL/6 livers or unaffected liver regions adjacent to HCC ( Figure 7A–7C ; data not shown).  Expression of tumor markers GP73, GS and AFP in tg1223 HCC We then evaluated expression of human liver tumor markers golgi protein 73 (GP73), glutamine synthetase (GS) and ?-fetoprotein (AFP) in tg 1223 livers ( Bachert et al., 2007 ; Marrero and Lok, 2004 ; Sakamoto, 2009 ). GP73, GS and AFP protein expression was elevated in most tg 1223 HCC as detected by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis compared to C57BL/6 livers or unaffected liver regions adjacent to HCC ( Figure 7A–7C ; data not shown).  Mechanisms driving LT??-induced chronic hepatitis and liver cancer To identify other receptors and molecular mediators potentially involved in LT-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC development, we intercrossed tg 1223 with Tnfr1 ?/? , Tnfr2 ?/? or Ikk? ?hep mice. The requirement of lymphocytes in chronic hepatitis and HCC formation was investigated by intercrossing with Rag1 ?/? mice, which lack mature lymphocytes. The absence of IKK?, TNFR1 or lymphocytes per se did not appear to influence transgenic Lt? and ? mRNA expression ( Figures 3A and 7D ). Initially, at three months of age, tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep , tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? , tg 1223/ Tnfr2 ?/? and tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? mice lacked histological evidence of hepatitis similar to tg 1223 mice (data not shown). The aberrant hepatic gene expression pattern described for 3 month-old tg 1223 mice developed only partially in tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep and tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? mice, whereas tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? livers displayed an expression profile rather similar to that of tg 1223 mice ( Figure 7D , Figure S7 ). At 9 months of age tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? (n=26) and tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep (n=18) livers lacked hepatitis, hepatocyte or oval-cell proliferation ( Figure S4 ), whereas tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? (n=8) or tg 1223/ Tnfr2 ?/? (n=8) livers were indistinguishable from those of tg 1223 mice ( Figures 7E and 7F , Figure S7 ). At the age of 18 months, tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? (n=26) and tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep (n=25) mice were devoid of hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.0001) ( Figures 5 and 7G ) suggesting that both lymphocytes and hepatocyte-specific IKK? expression are required for LT-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC development. Notably, tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? mice displayed HCC (4/12) with an incidence similar to tg 1223 mice ( Figures 5 and 7G , Figure S8; Table S18 and S19 ) indicating that TNFR1 signaling is not essential for LT-induced HCC formation in tg 1223 mice.  Mechanisms driving LT??-induced chronic hepatitis and liver cancer To identify other receptors and molecular mediators potentially involved in LT-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC development, we intercrossed tg 1223 with Tnfr1 ?/? , Tnfr2 ?/? or Ikk? ?hep mice. The requirement of lymphocytes in chronic hepatitis and HCC formation was investigated by intercrossing with Rag1 ?/? mice, which lack mature lymphocytes. The absence of IKK?, TNFR1 or lymphocytes per se did not appear to influence transgenic Lt? and ? mRNA expression ( Figures 3A and 7D ). Initially, at three months of age, tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep , tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? , tg 1223/ Tnfr2 ?/? and tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? mice lacked histological evidence of hepatitis similar to tg 1223 mice (data not shown). The aberrant hepatic gene expression pattern described for 3 month-old tg 1223 mice developed only partially in tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep and tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? mice, whereas tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? livers displayed an expression profile rather similar to that of tg 1223 mice ( Figure 7D , Figure S7 ). At 9 months of age tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? (n=26) and tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep (n=18) livers lacked hepatitis, hepatocyte or oval-cell proliferation ( Figure S4 ), whereas tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? (n=8) or tg 1223/ Tnfr2 ?/? (n=8) livers were indistinguishable from those of tg 1223 mice ( Figures 7E and 7F , Figure S7 ). At the age of 18 months, tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? (n=26) and tg 1223/ Ikk? ?hep (n=25) mice were devoid of hepatitis and HCC ( P <0.0001) ( Figures 5 and 7G ) suggesting that both lymphocytes and hepatocyte-specific IKK? expression are required for LT-induced chronic hepatitis and HCC development. Notably, tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? mice displayed HCC (4/12) with an incidence similar to tg 1223 mice ( Figures 5 and 7G , Figure S8; Table S18 and S19 ) indicating that TNFR1 signaling is not essential for LT-induced HCC formation in tg 1223 mice.  Hepatocytes are the major responsive liver cells to agonistic LT?R antibody treatment To investigate whether hepatocytes represent the major LT-responsive liver cells and to investigate LT?R signaling in Tnfr1 ?/? and Ikk? ?hep livers, TNF? (positive control), agonistic LT?R antibody (3C8) and appropriate negative controls (PBS; rat IgG) were administered intravenously (i.v.) to C57BL/6 and various knock-out mice ( Figure 8 , Figure S8 ). Nuclear p65 (RelA) translocation in hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells (NPC: e.g. Kupffer cells, lymphocytes), alterations in the hepatic transcriptome and protein expression of selected chemokines were examined. Administration of 3C8 induced nuclear p65 translocation primarily in hepatocytes and some NPC of C57BL/6 livers ( Figure 8A ), as well as transcriptional changes and upregulation of selected chemokines reminiscent of those observed in 3 month-old tg 1223 livers ( Figure 8A , Figure S9 ). Similar results were obtained after 3C8 treatment of Tnfr1 ?/? mice, in contrast to Ikk? ?hep livers which were devoid of nuclear p65 translocation in hepatocytes and NPC ( Table S20 and S21 ). Furthermore, upregulation of selected NF-?B target genes could not be detected. Control Lt?r ?/? mice treated with 3C8 lacked nuclear p65 translocation in hepatocytes or NPC as well as upregulation of selected NF-?B target genes. To examine whether lack of functional IKK? on hepatocytes and NPC would suppress LT?R induced upregulation of selected NF-?B responsive genes, we investigated livers of mice expressing a non-phosphorylatable IKK? AA knock-in allele ( Ikk? AA/AA ; Cao et al., 2001 ). Upon 3C8 treatment Ikk? AA/AA mice upregulated selected NF-?B responsive genes ( Figure S8 ). The degree of mRNA upregulation in liver was similar to 3C8-treated C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, control treated (rat IgG) Ikk? AA/AA mice lacked upregulation of selected NF-?B responsive genes. This suggests that 3C8-mediated hepatic LT?R signaling is mainly integrated by hepatocytes involving canonical NF-?B pathway.  Hepatocytes are the major responsive liver cells to agonistic LT?R antibody treatment To investigate whether hepatocytes represent the major LT-responsive liver cells and to investigate LT?R signaling in Tnfr1 ?/? and Ikk? ?hep livers, TNF? (positive control), agonistic LT?R antibody (3C8) and appropriate negative controls (PBS; rat IgG) were administered intravenously (i.v.) to C57BL/6 and various knock-out mice ( Figure 8 , Figure S8 ). Nuclear p65 (RelA) translocation in hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells (NPC: e.g. Kupffer cells, lymphocytes), alterations in the hepatic transcriptome and protein expression of selected chemokines were examined.

Furthermore, upregulation of selected NF-?B target genes could not be detected. Control Lt?r ?/? mice treated with 3C8 lacked nuclear p65 translocation in hepatocytes or NPC as well as upregulation of selected NF-?B target genes. To examine whether lack of functional IKK? on hepatocytes and NPC would suppress LT?R induced upregulation of selected NF-?B responsive genes, we investigated livers of mice expressing a non-phosphorylatable IKK? AA knock-in allele ( Ikk? AA/AA ; Cao et al., 2001 ). Upon 3C8 treatment Ikk? AA/AA mice upregulated selected NF-?B responsive genes ( Figure S8 ). The degree of mRNA upregulation in liver was similar to 3C8-treated C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, control treated (rat IgG) Ikk? AA/AA mice lacked upregulation of selected NF-?B responsive genes. This suggests that 3C8-mediated hepatic LT?R signaling is mainly integrated by hepatocytes involving canonical NF-?B pathway.  Inhibition of LT?R signaling reduces chronic hepatitis and carcinogenesis We further investigated the involvement of LT?R signaling in the transition of chronic hepatitis to HCC by long-term LT?R-Ig administration in tg 1223 mice. Nine month-old tg 1223 mice with chronic hepatitis (n=31) or age-matched C57BL/6 mice (n=23) were treated with LT?R-Ig for 2 months, remained untreated for another 4 weeks and were then sacrificed. LT?R-Ig treatment significantly reduced chronic hepatitis incidence in tg 1223 mice compared to untreated tg 1223 mice (treated: 4/31; untreated: 34/34; P <0.0001). Furthermore, LT?R-Ig treatment suppressed chronic hepatitis-driven HCC formation (treated: 0/31; untreated: 6/34; P <0.05) ( Figures 5 and 8B ). LT?R-Ig treatment did not lead to overt histopathological alterations in C57BL/6 livers or overt changes in lymphocyte (B-, T-cells) or macrophage populations within spleens of C57BL/6 or tg 1223 mice (data not shown). Efficiency of LT?R-Ig treatment was ascertained by the loss of LT?R-dependent follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) within C57BL/6 and tg 1223 spleens ( Figure S9 ). Thus, our results imply that long-term suppression of LT?R reduces chronic hepatitis incidence and can prevent the transition from chronic hepatitis to HCC in tg 1223 mice.  Inhibition of LT?R signaling reduces chronic hepatitis and carcinogenesis We further investigated the involvement of LT?R signaling in the transition of chronic hepatitis to HCC by long-term LT?R-Ig administration in tg 1223 mice.

Discussion This study uncovered drastic and robust mRNA upregulation of LT?R , LT? and LT? in HBV- or HCV-induced hepatitis and HCC. LT and LIGHT transcripts were mainly expressed by CD3+ T- and CD20+ B-cells; a significant proportion of LT? and LT? expression was also attributable to hepatocytes. Notably, upregulation of LT?R , LT? and LT? transcripts was also detected in non-virus related HCC, which could stem from activated, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and/or from neoplastic hepatocytes that have upregulated LT, possibly in response to IL6. It was demonstrated that HCC derived cell lines express IL6 ( Baffet et al., 1991 ) and that LT levels are increased in response to IL6 in the latter ( Subrata et al., 2005 ). LT signaling induces both canonical and non-canonical NF-?B signaling pathways, whose role in controlling liver cancer formation remains controversial ( Vainer et al., 2008 ). In a mouse model with acute DEN exposure, depletion of functional NF-?B signaling ( Ikk? ?hep mice) increased hepatocyte cell death, enhanced Kupffer-cell activation and elevated HCC incidence ( Maeda et al., 2005 ). In contrast, NF-?B signaling promotes HCC development in mdr2 ?/? mice ( Pikarsky et al., 2004 ) and hepatocyte-specific depletion of IKK? prevents HCC formation in tg 1223 mice. How can this contradictory role of IKK? signaling in HCC formation be reconciled? On the one hand IKK? signaling might be required for hepatocytes to appropriately respond to and survive carcinogenic stimuli and acute liver injury (e.g. DEN exposure). On the other hand, IKK? signaling might enable chemokine expression by hepatocytes leading to hepatitis and HCC. Consistent with this hypothesis, tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? mice were devoid of chronic hepatitis, hepatocyte or oval-cell proliferation and failed to develop HCC. Why could immune cells contribute to liver tumorigenesis? One explanation might be that CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells expressing inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL1?, TNF?, IFN?) as well as cytolytic proteins (e.g. Granzyme B) contribute to hepatocyte cell death, tissue remodeling and transformation, finally leading to HCC ( Budhu and Wang, 2006 ; Nakamoto et al., 1998 ). Intrahepatic lymphocytes may also influence the production of inflammatory mediators, as 3 month-old tg 1223/ Rag1 ?/? livers displayed markedly reduced cytokine and chemokine levels. We propose that rather than directly acting as a cell-autonomous oncogene on hepatocytes or A6+ oval cells, hepatic LT?? expression induces local upregulation of chemokines (e.g. Ccl2; Cxcl10, Cxcl1, Ccl7 ) by hepatocytes. This leads to the attraction of circulating inflammatory cells and a hyperproliferative, hepatotoxic environment stochastically leading to HCC formation ( Figure 8C ). It is worth mentioning that some chemokines found in this study (e.g. CXCL10) have been reported to be mainly expressed by human hepatocytes in chronic hepatitis C ( Zeremski et al., 2007 ). Ablation of TNFR1 signaling did not prevent chronic hepatitis and HCC formation in tg 1223 mice although anti-TNF? antibody treatment prevents HCC development in mdr2?/? mice ( Pikarsky et al., 2004 ). We investigated the mode of LT signaling in Tnfr1 ?/? livers upon 3C8 treatment. This induced analogous hepatic changes seen in tg 1223 mice at 3 months of age. Similar to our results with tg 1223/ Tnfr1 ?/? mice, this suggests that heterotrimeric LT causes p65 translocation in hepatocytes and induces a TNFR1-independent signaling cascade via LT?R, presumably contributing to chronic hepatitis and HCC. Most probably, HCC formation in mdr2 ?/? mice depends on pathways involving TNFR1 distinct from the LT?R-dependent pathways described in our study. I.v. administration of TNF? into Ikk? ?hep mice did not cause p65 translocation in hepatocytes but upregulated NF-?B target genes, presumably through TNF?-activated NPC. In contrast, 3C8 treatment in Ikk? ?hep mice had no effect. Therefore, hepatocytes but not NPC are likely to be the major liver cells integrating LT signaling. Interestingly, upon 3C8 treatment Ikk? AA/AA livers upregulated selected NF-?B target genes similar to C57BL/6 mice ( Figure S8 ). Therefore, absence of IKK? in hepatocytes and NPC, allows NF-?B target gene expression upon 3C8 treatment, suggesting the involvement of the classical NF-?B pathway in LT?R-induced hepatic signaling. LT?R signaling was reported to induce oval-cell proliferation ( Akhurst et al., 2005 ), which is thought to contribute to the development of liver tumors ( Lee et al., 2006 ). We observed proliferation of A6+ oval cells in chronically inflamed tg 1223 livers at the age of 9 months and found A6+ cells within and at the border of tg 1223 HCC. Whether those A6+ cells represent transformed oval cells contributing to liver carcinogenesis or whether A6 is upregulated on aberrant hepatocytes within HCC remains to be determined. Lack of lymphocytes or chronic hepatitis prevented oval-cell proliferation, although LT?, ? transgene expression was unaltered. Therefore, it is conceivable that activated, infiltrating lymphocytes or Kupffer cells may contribute to oval cell proliferation by providing further LT or other cytokines in tg 1223 livers. Based on the presented data, a sequence of events leading to chronic hepatitis and HCC in tg 1223 mice can be proposed ( Figure 8C ). What are the possible clinical implications of our findings? It has recently been demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of LT?R signaling reduces virus-, bacteria- and concavalin A-induced liver injury ( An et al., 2006 ; Anand et al., 2006 ; Puglielli et al., 1999 ), while triggering LT?R signaling on hepatocytes appears beneficial during liver regeneration ( Tumanov et al., 2008 ). Moreover, siRNA knock-down of various components of the LT?R signaling pathway (e.g. LT?; Rel A) were shown to interfere with HCV replication in vitro ( Ng et al., 2007 ). Therefore, inhibition of LT?R signaling might also impede the efficiency of HCV replication. But what are the possible side-effects of blocking LT?R signaling? Effects include alterations in the microarchitecture of white pulp follicles and disappearance of FDC networks in non-human primates ( Gommerman et al., 2002 ). Of note, despite the loss of FDCs and a reduced capacity to trap immune complexes the primary antibody response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin was not significantly altered ( Gommerman et al., 2002 ). Accordingly, we have investigated a possible beneficial effect of blocking LT?R signaling in tg 1223 mice with chronic hepatitis. This partially reverted inflammation and prevented HCC formation, suggesting that LT?R-Ig treatment might be beneficial in liver pathologies with sustained LT signaling. Our results show that LT signaling is critically involved in hepatitis and subsequent HCC development and imply that blocking LT?R signaling might become a beneficial therapeutic approach in the context of HBV- or HCV-induced chronic hepatitis and other liver diseases displaying sustained hepatic LT?R signaling.
