Identification of a Novel DPA1 Allele, DPA1*010602 in an East African Population We report here a novel DPA1 allele, DPA1*010602, which was identified from an East African population during sequence-based HLA-DPA1 typing. Through cloning and sequencing multiple clones we confirmed that the new allele is identical to DPA1*010301 at exon 2 except for 2 nucleotide substitutions (ATG to CAG) at codon 31. The substitutions changed the amino acid at codon 31 from Methionine (Met) to Glutamine (Gln). The WHO nomenclature committee has named this new allele, DPA1*010602.
