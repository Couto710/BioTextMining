Go Red for Women: Thrombosis and Anti-Thrombotic Therapy in Women Sex-based differences in the prevalence and presentation of arterial and venous thrombosis exist, and emerging data indicates that men and women do not accrue equal benefit from anti-thrombotic therapy. Sex hormones alter procoagulant protein expression and the function of blood and vascular cells. Sex-based differences in platelet function have been reported, and in animal models, sex-based differences in thrombosis have been noted. Here we review plausible mechanisms that may explain how sex functions as a modifier of thrombosis and summarize clinical data on the interaction between sex and response to anti-thrombotic therapy.  Conclusions In summary, sex hormones alter procoagulant protein levels, platelet function, and the vessel wall in a manner that may translate into sex-based differences in thrombosis. Moreover, the male pattern of growth hormone secretion may regulate coagulation and thrombosis. The differences in platelet and coagulation function may, at least in part, explain the clinical observations that women are more likely to be aspirin-resistant, to accrue distinct benefits from aspirin therapy as primary prevention, and to present with different patterns of VTE and stroke in the setting of atrial fibrillation. Additionally, alterations in vessel wall biology between men and women may contribute to differences in thrombosis patterns and responses to anti-thrombotic therapy. In particular, the ability of aspirin therapy as primary prevention to lower MI in men and stroke in women and the differences in treatment benefit of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors in women with acute coronary syndromes may reflect differences in the nature, burden, and presentation of atherosclerotic disease between women and men. All anti-thrombotic therapy is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Bleeding complications are often higher in women, in part due to their smaller size and often older age at presentation than men. However, sex-based differences in vessel or blood function may exist that contribute to increased bleeding rates in women. Clearly additional studies are needed to define the mechanisms that control sex-based differences in thrombosis at the molecular, cellular and whole organismal level. Moreover, clinical trials should rigorously examine the benefits and risks of anti-thrombotic therapy by sex, to ensure efficacy and safety in women and men.
