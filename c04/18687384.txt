T cell memory in the injured facial motor nucleus: Relation to functional recovery following facial nerve crush T cells have the ability to mount a memory response to a previously encountered antigen such that re-exposure to the antigen results in a response that is greater in magnitude and function. Following facial nerve transection, T cells have been shown to traffic to injured motor neurons in the facial motor nucleus (FMN) and may have the ability to promote neuronal survival and functional recovery. Previously, we demonstrated that early exposure to neuronal injury on one side of the brain during young adulthood elicited a T cell response that was greater in magnitude following exposure to the same form of injury on the contralateral side later in adulthood. Whether the T cell memory response to neuronal injury influenced functional recovery following nerve crush injury was unknown. In the current study, we tested the hypotheses that (1) transection of the right facial nerve in sensitized mice would result in faster recovery of the whisker response when the contralateral facial nerve is crushed 10 weeks later, and (2) the early recovery would be associated with an increase in the magnitude of the T cell response in the contralateral FMN following crush injury in sensitized mice. The onset of modest recovery in sensitized mice occurred between 3 and 5 days following crush injury of the contralateral facial nerve, approximately 1.5 days earlier than na√Øve mice, and was associated with more than a two-fold increase in the magnitude of the T cell response in the contralateral FMN following crush injury. There was no difference between groups in the number of days to full recovery. Further study of how T cell memory influences neuroregeneration may have important implications for translational research.
