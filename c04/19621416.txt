Molecular pathology of the fibroblast growth factor family Human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family contains 22 proteins that regulate a plethora of physiological processes in both developing and adult organism. The mutations in the FGF genes were not known to play role in human disease until the year 2000, when mutations in FGF23 were found to cause hypophosphataemic rickets. Nine years later, seven FGFs have been associated with human disorders. These include FGF3 in Michel aplasia; FGF8 in cleft lip/palate and in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; FGF9 in carcinoma; FGF10 in the lacrimal/salivary glands aplasia, and lacrimo-auriculo-dento-digital syndrome; FGF14 in spinocerebellar ataxia; FGF20 in Parkinson disease; and FGF23 in tumoral calcinosis and hypophosphataemic rickets. The heterogeneity in the functional consequences of FGF mutations, the modes of inheritance, pattern of involved tissues/organs, and effects in different developmental stages provide fascinating insights into the physiology of the FGF signaling system. This article reviews the current knowledge about the molecular pathology of the FGF family.
