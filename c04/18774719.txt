Circular reasoning: microRNAs and cell cycle control MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have attracted significant attention given their important roles in development, normal physiology, and disease states including cancer. Recent studies have identified specific miRNAs that regulate the cell cycle and documented that the loss or gain of miRNA-mediated cell-cycle control contributes to malignancy. miRNAs regulate classic cell-cycle control pathways by directly targeting proteins such as E2F transcription factors, cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), cyclins, and Cdk inhibitors (CKIs). Moreover, recent findings suggest that miRNAs themselves might be subject to cell-cycle dependent regulation. Together, these observations indicate that reciprocal control of RNA silencing and the metazoan cell-cycle impacts cellular behavior and disease.
