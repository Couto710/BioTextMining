Multiple Myeloma: Biology, Standard Therapy, and Transplant Therapy The understanding of the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma has undergone a major transformation over the past eight years. New insights into the microenvironment of the plasma cell as well as elucidation of signaling pathways that prevent plasma cell apoptosis are leading to rapid new drug development. The introduction of novel agents has led to a significant increase in survival. Combinations of novel agents are expected to provide higher complete response rate with anticipated prolongation of relapse free and overall survival. Autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains an integral part of therapy further improving the outcomes following induction with novel agents.
