Analysis of the rat Iddm14 diabetes susceptibility locus in multiple rat strains: identification of a susceptibility haplotype in the Tcrb-V locus Iddm14 (formerly Iddm4 ) is a non-MHC-linked genetic locus associated with autoimmune diabetes. Its effects have been well-documented in BB-derived rats in which diabetes is either induced by immunologic perturbation or occurs spontaneously. The role of Iddm14 in non-BB rat strains is unknown. Our goal was to extend the analysis of Iddm14 in new diabetes-susceptible strains and to identify candidate genes in the rat Iddm14 diabetes susceptibility locus that are common to these multiple diabetic strains. To determine if Iddm14 is important in strains other than BB, we first genotyped a (LEW.1WR1 × WF)F2 cohort in which diabetes was induced by perturbation with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid. We found that Iddm14 is a major determinant of diabetes susceptibility in LEW.1WR1 rats. We then used nucleotide sequencing to establish a strain distribution pattern of polymorphisms (insertions, deletions, and single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) that predicts susceptibility to diabetes in a panel of inbred and congenic rats. Using the positional information from the congenic strains and the new linkage data, we identified a susceptibility haplotype in the T-cell receptor V ? chain ( Tcrb-V ) locus. This haplotype includes Tcrb-V13 , which is identical in five susceptible strains but different in resistant WF and F344 rats. We conclude that Iddm14 is a powerful determinant of both spontaneous and induced autoimmune diabetes in multiple rat strains, and that Tcrb-V13 SNPs constitute a haplotype of gene elements that may be critical for autoimmune diabetes in rats.  Materials and methods Animals and DNA F344 rats were obtained from Charles River, Inc. (Wilmington, MA). BBDP/Wor, LEW.1WR1, and PVG.R8 rats were obtained from BRM, Inc. (Worcester, MA). DR.F344/lyp rats were bred at the University of Washington, Seattle ( Fuller et al. 2006 ). BBDR/Wor, WF. ART2 , and WF. Idd-m14.ART2a rats (all RT1 u/u, ART2a ) were obtained from colonies maintained at the University of Massachusetts. WF. ART2 congenic rats were developed by us and differ from ordinary WF animals in that they express at least one copy of the “a” rather than the “b” allotype of the ART2 T-cell alloantigen on chromosome 1 ( Blankenhorn et al. 2005 ; Mordes et al. 2002 ), making it possible to deplete them of ART2+ regulatory cells with available reagents. Both WF.ART2 a/a homozygotes and WF.ART2 a/b heterozygotes were bred, and their use in individual experiments is specified where necessary. The original WF breeding stock (ART2 b/b ) was obtained from Charles River Laboratories. WF. Iddm14.ART2a/b double congenic rats bear a small interval of BBDR chromosome 4 on the WF background and were developed as described ( Blankenhorn et al. 2005 , 2007 ; Martin et al. 1999a , b ). Cohorts of (WF. ART2 × WF. Iddm14 ) congenic rats with progressively smaller Iddm14 intervals were bred by repetitive rounds of mating using a marker-assisted selection protocol as described ( Blankenhorn et al. 2007 ; Mordes et al. 2002 ). (LEW.1WR1 × WF. ART2a/a )F2 rats were bred in our colony. Animals were housed in viral antibody-free conditions, confirmed monthly to be serologically free of rat pathogens ( Mordes et al. 2002 ), and maintained in accordance with institutional guidelines and recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals ( Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, Commission on Life Sciences and National Research Council 1996 ). Most DNA samples were prepared from tail snips and screened using microsatellite markers that define the Iddm14 and ART2 intervals plus a selected panel of additional microsatellite loci as described ( Blankenhorn et al. 2005 , 2007 ; Mordes et al. 2002 ). DNA from spontaneously diabetic KDP rats ( Yokoi et al. 2002 ) was the gift of Dr. Fraser Scott (University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Induction of diabetes Diabetes in WF. Iddm14.ART2a rats was induced using the protocol employed in previous mapping studies of this locus ( Mordes et al. 2002 ). Briefly, 28–32-day-old rats were treated with cytotoxic DS4.23 anti-ART2.1 mAb (25 ?g of purified mAb 5 times per week) and poly I:C (2.5 ?g/g 3 times per week). Treatment was continued for 40 days or until diagnosis of diabetes. Animals were screened three times weekly for glycosuria, and diabetes was diagnosed on the basis of a plasma glucose concentration greater than 250 mg/dl (One-Touch Handheld Glucose Analyzer, Johnson & Johnson, Milpitas, CA). Diabetes in (LEW.1WR1 × WF)F2 rats was induced with poly I:C alone at a dose of 1 ?g/g 3 times per week. Sequencing Primers were designed to flank-selected members of the Tcrb-V gene family from the leader sequences to the heptamer-nonamer joining signals ( Williams and Gutman 1989 ). Primers were added to genomic DNA templates and then subjected to PCR using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity Supermix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 40 cycles at 0.2 ?M final primer concentration. PCR samples were purified and sequenced by GeneWiz ( www.genewiz.com ) from a dye-terminator reaction using an internal variable region primer. Sequences were aligned and compared with the Multiple Sequence Alignment program by CLUSTAL ( http://align.genome.jp ).  Animals and DNA F344 rats were obtained from Charles River, Inc. (Wilmington, MA). BBDP/Wor, LEW.1WR1, and PVG.R8 rats were obtained from BRM, Inc. (Worcester, MA). DR.F344/lyp rats were bred at the University of Washington, Seattle ( Fuller et al. 2006 ).

Cohorts of (WF. ART2 × WF. Iddm14 ) congenic rats with progressively smaller Iddm14 intervals were bred by repetitive rounds of mating using a marker-assisted selection protocol as described ( Blankenhorn et al. 2007 ; Mordes et al. 2002 ).

Sequences were aligned and compared with the Multiple Sequence Alignment program by CLUSTAL ( http://align.genome.jp ).  Analysis of <italic>Tcrb-V</italic> genes and haplotypes in diabetes-susceptible and -resistant rat strains Our previous linkage analyses have demonstrated that the supported interval for Iddm14 is between 67,962,305 and 69,392,848 bases on rat chromosome 4 ( Blankenhorn et al. 2007 ). The T-cell receptor ? -chain variable region gene family is of particular interest as a potential source of candidate genes. It is located in the middle of the supported interval for Iddm14 . In preliminary studies we observed a difference in the ability of four T1D-susceptible rats (BBDR, KDP, PVG.R8, and LEW.1WR1) and one resistant rat (WF) to express Tcrb-V4 ( Blankenhorn et al. 2007 and data not shown). Sequencing of Tcrb-V4 revealed an amber stop codon at amino acid position 107 in the 3? end of the WF allele. This stop codon is also present in the rat genome project-type strain BN, which is known to be a diabetes-resistant animal ( Klöting et al. 2003 ). We showed by quantitative PCR that Tcrb-V4 is, in fact, not expressed in T cells from WF rats (data not shown). As Iddm14 encompasses the entire TCRBV region, however, we elected to study the remaining TCR variable genes for nucleotide polymorphisms. As shown in Table 2 , we constructed a strain distribution pattern (SDP) for diabetes itself and for the multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Tcrb-V region of the Iddm14 interval for a panel of rat strains. These now included three rat strains associated with resistance to T1D and five with documented susceptibility. The expanded panel of resistant strains included not only WF ( Martin et al. 1999a ), but also BN ( Klöting et al. 2003 ) and F344 ( Fuller et al. 2006 ; Klaff et al. 1999 ). The susceptible strains included BBDR ( Mordes et al. 2007 ), BBDP ( Blankenhorn et al. 2005 ), LEW.1WR1 ( Mordes et al. 2005 ), PVG.R8 ( Ellerman and Like 2000 ), and KDP ( Yokoi et al. 2002 ). KDP and PVG.R8 rats have not been subjected to linkage analyses that would have the ability to identify their requirement for Iddm14 . Our SNP analysis encompassed Tcrb-V1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5.1 and 5.2 , 6 , 7 , 8.1 , 8.2 , 8.3 , and 8.4 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , and 20 . These comprise the majority (22) of the 24 Tcrb-V family members identified either by previous studies ( Smith et al. 1991 ) or by our own manual bioinformatics analysis using a sequencing contig from the BN genome strain known to contain all the TCRB elements (NW_047690). There were multiple SNP and insertion/deletions (“indels”) among these sequences ( Table 2 ). This SDP analysis not only confirmed our previous observations concerning the allelic variance of Tcrb-V4 but it also revealed numerous additional SNP alleles, among them a 35-bp deletion that disrupts the Tcrb-V1 reading frame in both WF and BN rats. Surprisingly, however, the resistant F344 rat was found to share the same Tcrb-V1 and  <italic>Tcrb-V4</italic> alleles that are present in our panel of five T1D susceptible strains Additional analysis revealed that among all the changes, the Tcrb-V element with a SDP that most closely resembles the diabetes SDP is the complex set of polymorphisms in Tcrb-V13 . Eight of the SNPs form an allele that is dichotomous and distinguishes those rats susceptible to T1D (including all the strains for which Iddm14 is critical) from those that are resistant to T1D. Furthermore, the T1D-resistant F344 rat has a resistant WF-like allele that contains an additional SNP (indel). This SNP creates a frameshift that leads to a stop codon, making Tcrb-V13 a pseudogene in this strain. The lack of expression of Tcrb-V13 was noted previously ( Stienekemeier et al. 2000 ), and our sequence confirms the basis for its absence. The Tcrb-V13 alleles in BN and WF rats have been designated BV13S1A2, and LEW rats carry the BV13S1A1 allele; the allele in F344 rats has been designated BV13S1A3P ( Stienekemeier et al. 2000 ). In addition, DNA from “DR.F344/lyp” diabetes-resistant congenic rats ( Fuller et al. 2006 ) showed Tcrb-V1 , Tcrb-V4 , and Tcrb-V13 SNPs identical to those in commercial F344 rats (data not shown). Finally, a phylogenetic analysis of the BV13S1 genes from the eight rat strains considered here associates the Iddm14 resistance haplotype withT1D resistance. SNPs in the three resistant strains are clustered in an evolutionary group that is clearly distinguished from the group to which the five susceptible strains belong ( Fig. 1 ).  Results Diabetes in the LEW.1WR1 rat segregates with <italic>Iddm14</italic> To determine if Iddm14 is a determinant of diabetes susceptibility in LEW.1WR1 rats, (LEW.1WR1 × WF. ART2a )F2 rats were treated with poly I:C alone as described in Methods. This treatment protocol induces autoimmune diabetes in 100% of LEW.1WR1 rats ( Mordes et al. 2005 ) but few WF rats ( Ellerman and Like 2000 ). Of the 75 rats in the F2 cohort, 29 (39%) became diabetic within 40 days of induction. All rats were typed for Iddm14 using the D4Got43 microsatellite marker that is located near the peak of the Iddm14 QTL interval ( Blankenhorn et al. 2005 ). As shown in Table 1 , the distribution of Iddm14 and diabetes was absolute: all 29 diabetic rats bore at least one allele of the LEW-derived Iddm14 marker ( p <0.01).

KDP and PVG.R8 rats have not been subjected to linkage analyses that would have the ability to identify their requirement for Iddm14 .

Discussion The data presented here confirm and extend our hypothesis that the Iddm14 autoimmune diabetes locus in the rat is a powerful determinant of disease penetrance and that Iddm14 -mediated diabetes resistance may be due to recessive protective mutations in Tcrb-V genes. Previous studies of (WF × BBDP) × WF ( Martin et al. 1999a ) and (WF × BBDR) × WF ( Martin et al. 1999b ) backcrosses established Iddm14 as a major determinant of diabetes susceptibility common to both BBDP and BBDR rats ( Martin et al. 1999a , b ). Subsequent studies have confirmed the stability of our phenotype through an N11 generation congenic in which Iddm14 is mapped to an interval no greater than approximately 2.5 Mb on chromosome 4 ( Blankenhorn et al. 2007 ). The present work extends our previous findings to five additional strains, including LEW.1WR1, that vary in their susceptibility to T1D. The data are consistent with a role for the Tcrb-V13 TCR element in T1D that is induced in susceptible animals by immune perturbation. They are also consistent with the resistance to spontaneous T1D of DR.F344/lyp rats bearing an F344-derived Iddm14 interval ( Fuller et al. 2006 ), indicating that Iddm14 is important for both induced and spontaneous T1D. Iddm14 is incompletely penetrant and expression of diabetes is certain to be sensitive to genetic background. Consistent with this view of sensitive dependence on genetic background are several observations. First, in previous studies, not all F2 or backcross rats bearing permissive alleles of Iddm14 became diabetic. Second, an unexpected reduction in spontaneous type 1 diabetes incidence in a BBDP.WF congenic line was found to be the result of WF alleles at a novel locus ( Iddm24 ) on chromosome 8 ( Wallis et al. 2007 ). Third, we (J. M. Fuller et al., unpublished) and others ( Hornum et al. 2007 ) have noted that WF. Iddm14.Iddm2 congenic rats do not develop diabetes despite the presence of three high-risk diabetes susceptibility loci, Iddm1 (the MHC), Iddm2 ( Gimap5 , the cause of lymphopenia), and Iddm14 . Considering the last two points together, it is interesting to speculate that WF-origin alleles at another locus such as Iddm24 might also contribute to the absence of spontaneous diabetes in WF. Iddm14.Iddm2 congenics. Our discovery that Tcrb-V1 , 4 , and 13 are associated with resistance to diabetes in three strains (WF, F344, and BN) that bear a related haplotype at Iddm14 suggests that when present in the context of a single high-risk MHC class II haplotype, the Tcrb-V gene family is a major determinant of disease probability. In the rat, with a single unusual exception ( Penhale et al. 1990 ), all strains with documented susceptibility to autoimmune diabetes express the RT1B/Du class II MHC haplotype ( Awata et al. 1995 ). Extrapolating from human and mouse data, it has always been assumed that redundancy among cognate rat TCRs would preclude reliance on any one family of TCR ? or ? chains for disease susceptibility. As a corollary, it was further assumed that the resistance of many RT1u rat strains to diabetes was dependent on other, unspecified “background” genes. Nonetheless, in our analysis, Tcrb-V13 alone could account for the resistance of WF, F344, and BN rats, as all three share the BV13S1A2 ( Stienekemeier et al. 2000 ) sequence of Tcrb-V13 . This holds true for systems in which autoimmune diabetes occurs as the result of immunologic perturbation ( Mordes et al. 2007 ; the present data) as well as spontaneously ( Fuller et al. 2006 ). The F344 rat in addition harbors a stop codon that makes the BV13A3 gene product nonfunctional ( Stienekemeier et al. 2000 ). Whether the Tcrb-V13 allele alone predisposes to T1D in the rat or whether other mutations such as those we have discovered in Tcrb-V1 and Tcrb-V4 can also contribute to susceptibility will require functional studies. With respect to functionality, it is noteworthy that the BV13S1A2 allele has been shown to skew the TCR repertoire and substantially alter the CD4+ to CD8+ ratio of V ? 13+ T cells ( Stienekemeier et al. 2000 ). The elements of the TCR form the basis of antigen recognition by T cells, which is critical for diabetes pathogenesis, but there has been limited support for the importance of the TCR in existing genetic studies of NOD mouse and human T1D. Our discovery that TCR ? chains are strong candidate determinants of diabetes susceptibility in the rat is therefore of potential importance for understanding the mechanisms of T1D etiology and pathogenesis. This finding should spur further detailed study of human and mouse T1D genetics. In the rat, our Iddm14 candidates function as recessive protective alleles. Control rats that rarely or never become diabetic are homozygous for an Iddm14 haplotype that does not make either Tcrb-V1 or Tcrb-V4 (WF, BN), or does not make Tcrb-V13 (F344). This situation is less likely to occur and be detected in outbred human populations. In addition, the human data sets that fail to implicate the TCR are based on either classical genome mapping or SNP haplotyping. Neither method is ideal for detecting recessive protective alleles because “resistant” individuals would have to be homozygous for the loss of several key Tcrb-V elements, as we propose is important in the rat. Furthermore, stratification by HLA may be required for detection of TCR effects in human T1D. In the NOD mouse studies, no TCR chain family has been linked to T1D, but a role for a limited TCR? repertoire could nonetheless be important. Several analyses of T-cell repertoire, especially in early prediabetic stages, implicate an oligoclonal T-cell response by NOD mice ( Haskins 2005 ; Quinn et al. 2006 ). Interestingly, Tcrb-V1 and Tcrb-V4 , which are homologous in mouse and rat, are frequently found in this limited primary T-cell repertoire ( Haskins 2005 ; Quinn et al. 2006 ), and Tcrb-V4 + diabetogenic T-cell clones, including BDC2.5, are abundant ( Haskins 2005 ). NOD and C57Bl/6 mice share alleles at most Tcrb loci (phenome.jax.org) and, thus, Idd -congenic strains based on differences between NOD and C57Bl/6 would be unlikely to show linkage to the Tcrb region. The one major direct linkage test of a role for Tcrb-V used a parental strain (SJL) that has a major deletion of Tcrb-V and proved only that murine Tcrb-V5 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , and 13 are not required for development of insulitis or spontaneous diabetes ( Shizuru et al. 1991 ). However, NOD8.3 TCR transgenic mice, in which the majority of T cells are skewed toward expression of an IGRP-specific V ? 8+ TCR, develop disease with a much more rapid onset ( Dudek et al. 2006 ; Verdaguer et al. 1996 ). We suggest that inbred rat strains have retained more TCR polymorphism and diversity than have inbred mice. If so, they may serve as better models of human Tcrb-V usage than mice. Autoimmunity-prone rats may offer the opportunity to test in depth the hypothesis that Tcrb-V chain variation contributes to T1D susceptibility or severity across a range of genetically susceptible strains. We recognize that a Tcrb-V haplotype, although a plausible cluster of candidate genes, remains only a candidate haplotype. Among the candidate genes in the Iddm14 interval are many trypsinogen genes, olfactory genes, caspase 2, and taste receptors. In addition, even if Tcrb-V4 , 1 , and 13 elements contribute susceptibility, the data do not exclude the possibility that other Tcrb-V family members can be used in the autoimmune recognition of islet antigens, as has been demonstrated in the NOD mouse, where little if any Tcrb-V oligoclonality is observed after diabetes onset ( Galley and Danska 1995 ). Nonetheless, it its intriguing to note both that many published diabetogenic murine T-cell clones express Tcrb-V4 and that the sequence of several of these mouse ? chains is remarkably similar to rat Tcrb-V4 ( Haskins 2005 ; Quinn et al. 2006 ; Sherman et al. 1987 ). Studies to determine if Tcrb-V1 , 4 , and/or 13 are all constituents of an Iddm14 haplotype will require new resources: antibodies to rat V ? family members, an analysis of Tcrb-V gene usage in the pancreas of rats that are becoming diabetic, TCR spectratyping, or the application of RNA interference technology to knock down rat Tcrb-V4 expression. Efforts to develop the needed resources are underway in our laboratories. In conclusion, our data suggest that the TCR ? -chain usage may contribute to the penetrance of both spontaneous and induced autoimmune diabetes in genetically susceptible rats of multiple different strains. Dissection of the TCR gene region will provide mechanistic analyses to uncover the possible role of the MCH/TCR interaction in the development of ? -cell-specific autoimmunity.  Discussion The data presented here confirm and extend our hypothesis that the Iddm14 autoimmune diabetes locus in the rat is a powerful determinant of disease penetrance and that Iddm14 -mediated diabetes resistance may be due to recessive protective mutations in Tcrb-V genes. Previous studies of (WF × BBDP) × WF ( Martin et al. 1999a ) and (WF × BBDR) × WF ( Martin et al. 1999b ) backcrosses established Iddm14 as a major determinant of diabetes susceptibility common to both BBDP and BBDR rats ( Martin et al. 1999a , b ). Subsequent studies have confirmed the stability of our phenotype through an N11 generation congenic in which Iddm14 is mapped to an interval no greater than approximately 2.5 Mb on chromosome 4 ( Blankenhorn et al. 2007 ). The present work extends our previous findings to five additional strains, including LEW.1WR1, that vary in their susceptibility to T1D. The data are consistent with a role for the Tcrb-V13 TCR element in T1D that is induced in susceptible animals by immune perturbation. They are also consistent with the resistance to spontaneous T1D of DR.F344/lyp rats bearing an F344-derived Iddm14 interval ( Fuller et al. 2006 ), indicating that Iddm14 is important for both induced and spontaneous T1D. Iddm14 is incompletely penetrant and expression of diabetes is certain to be sensitive to genetic background. Consistent with this view of sensitive dependence on genetic background are several observations. First, in previous studies, not all F2 or backcross rats bearing permissive alleles of Iddm14 became diabetic. Second, an unexpected reduction in spontaneous type 1 diabetes incidence in a BBDP.WF congenic line was found to be the result of WF alleles at a novel locus ( Iddm24 ) on chromosome 8 ( Wallis et al. 2007 ). Third, we (J. M. Fuller et al., unpublished) and others ( Hornum et al. 2007 ) have noted that WF. Iddm14.Iddm2 congenic rats do not develop diabetes despite the presence of three high-risk diabetes susceptibility loci, Iddm1 (the MHC), Iddm2 ( Gimap5 , the cause of lymphopenia), and Iddm14 . Considering the last two points together, it is interesting to speculate that WF-origin alleles at another locus such as Iddm24 might also contribute to the absence of spontaneous diabetes in WF. Iddm14.Iddm2 congenics. Our discovery that Tcrb-V1 , 4 , and 13 are associated with resistance to diabetes in three strains (WF, F344, and BN) that bear a related haplotype at Iddm14 suggests that when present in the context of a single high-risk MHC class II haplotype, the Tcrb-V gene family is a major determinant of disease probability.
