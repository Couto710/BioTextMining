A recent perspective on alcohol, immunity and host defense Overview Multiple line of clinical and experimental evidence demonstrates that both acute, moderate and chronic, excessive alcohol use result in various abnormalities in the functions of the immune system. Altered inflammatory cell and adaptive immune responses in turn result in increased incidence and poor outcome of infections and other organ effects after alcohol use. This review article summarizes recent findings relevant to immunomodulation by alcohol and its consequences on host defense against microbial pathogens and tissue injury.
