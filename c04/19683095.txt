Computer-Mediated Patient Education: Opportunities and Challenges for Supporting Women with Ovarian Cancer A majority of women with ovarian cancer will face recurrent disease despite receiving aggressive chemotherapy at the time of diagnosis. Given the complex medical and psychosocial needs of women with ovarian cancer and the time constraints within busy clinical settings, providing women with the necessary education related to their disease and treatments can be challenging. The advent of computers and web-based technologies has created new opportunities for educating cancer patients and supporting them to better cope with their disease. The purpose of this paper is to review prior studies of computer-based patient education interventions in order to identify key intervention components and other factors associated with improved patient outcomes. Opportunities for using computer-based technologies to support women with ovarian cancer are discussed and WRITE Symptoms (a W ritten R epresentational I ntervention T o E ase Symptoms ), a web-based, symptom management intervention for women with recurrent ovarian cancer is introduced.  FINDINGS A. Common Components of Computer-Mediated Patient Education Interventions Common components of interventions in the identified studies included provision of information, cognitive-behavioral approaches, skills training, peer support, expert advice, and communication training. Information was provided regarding the disease itself, associated symptoms, recommended treatments and/or management strategies. Cognitive behavioral approaches included formal cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as well as other theoretically guided components designed to enhance adoption of new behaviors. Common components in this category included goal setting, problem-solving, motivational interviewing, overcoming barriers, cognitive reframing, and self-management counseling. Skills training included practical “how to” information such as tips and skills for preparing nutritious foods, proper blood sugar monitoring techniques, and instructions on how to do relaxation or strengthening exercises. Peer support was another common component and included a variety of computer/internet tools to connect patients suffering from the same illness. Specific tools included chat rooms, discussion boards, e-mail systems, and peer coaching. Many studies included access to a health care expert as part of their intervention; this access ranged from providing as needed responses to patient-generated questions to conducting formal educational/counseling sessions at prescribed intervals. In some cases, computer-mediated activities with experts were supplemented by telephone or in-person contacts. Finally, several interventions specifically focused on improving patient-health care provider communication through self-advocacy or communication training. Table 1 provides a summary of the different categories of intervention components used in each of the reviewed studies. Information provision was the most common intervention component, followed by access to an expert, and teaching cognitive behavioral strategies. B. Effectiveness of Computer-Mediated Patient Education Interventions A wide range of outcomes were evaluated in the reviewed studies. For ease of synthesis, these outcomes were categorized as changes in: 1) knowledge and beliefs, 2) self-care behaviors, 3) social support, 4) patient health, and 5) health care utilization. Assessments of knowledge and beliefs included whether or not the patient retained provided information as well as the effect of interventions on concepts such as self-efficacy, barriers to change, and confidence. Measures of self-care behaviors were most common in studies of patients with diabetes and typically focused on assessments of dietary intake and physical activity. Other self-care behaviors that were measured included the use of stress management strategies and health care provider communication. Measures of patient health included both physical and emotional outcomes and varied by target population. Studies of diabetes focused on HbA1c, BMI, and cholesterol; depression studies focused on depression, anxiety, and functional outcomes; other studies included outcomes such as blood pressure, physical symptoms (pain and fatigue), disease-related distress, and quality of life. Few studies included assessments of perceived social support and health care outcomes. Table 1 includes a summary of the number of each type of outcomes that were assessed as well as the number of outcomes that were significantly improved in each of the studies. Healthcare utilization as an outcome is not included in the table, but is discussed in the following sections. Overall, computer-mediated interventions have been shown to be effective in improving both physical and mental health outcomes in persons with chronic health conditions, particularly when an expert interventionist is utilized. Exemplars of successful studies highlighting intervention components and delivery methods that were effective are provided in the following sections. Diabetes In diabetes, Shea and colleagues (2007) and Glasgow and colleagues ( Glasgow, Boles, McKay, Feil, & Barrera, 2003 ; Glasgow et al., 1997 ; Glasgow et al., 2005 ; Glasgow et al., 2004 ; Glasgow et al., 2006 ; Glasgow & Toobert, 2000 ) evaluated two different approaches to computer-mediated patient education. To test the “Informatics for Diabetes and Education Telemedicine” (IDEATEL) intervention, Shea et al. recruited 1665 Medicare recipients with diabetes, aged 55 years or older, and living in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York. Over 75% of patients did not know how to use a computer and 93% reported a median income of <$20,000. Patients assigned to the intervention were provided with computers and telemedicine units in their homes and participated in a range of activities that included: 1) videoconferencing between patients and a nurse case manager; 2) remote glucose monitoring with electronic upload and integration with the patients electronic medical record; 3) access to a web portal that contained their own clinical data and secure web-based messaging with nurse case managers; and 4) access to an educational web site created for the project (regular and low literacy versions). One year post-intervention, participants in the IDEATEL intervention had significantly greater reductions in HbA1C, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol than those in the control group, who received standard care. Effects were strongest for participants who had HbA1c levels > 7 at baseline. The authors noted that Medicare claims were higher in the intervention group compared to control – an issue that warrants further exploration. The authors hypothesized that providing patients in medically underserved areas with access to nurse case managers may have provided patients with the advice and encouragement to seek needed care that they had not previously been receiving. A particular strength of this project was the focus on an underserved patient population and the provision of computers to patients with no previous computer experience. Their findings provide important support for the generalizability of computer-mediated interventions, demonstrating that older, low income patients without computer experience are willing to use and can benefit from computer-mediated education and disease management. The work of Glasgow and colleagues is noteworthy for the investigators’ efforts to create cost-effective studies that are highly generalizable. These researchers at the Oregon Research Institute (ORI) have developed a series of “practical clinical trials”. Practical clinical trials are designed with clinically relevant interventions as control conditions, include a diverse patient population (broad study inclusion criteria), and recruit from heterogeneous practice settings ( Tunis, Stryer, & Clancy, 2003 ). The ORI studies have emphasized interventions that could move quickly to widespread adoption by virtue of being brief, fitting into the realities of clinic visits, and reducing demands on physician ( Glasgow et al., 2004 ). Glasgow and colleagues began their computer-mediated diabetes education programs in 1997 with an intervention that included two parts. The first was a brief (5- to 10- minute) computer based assessment and feedback on dietary patterns, key barriers for dietary self-management, and preferences for self-care strategies. Two printouts were generated, one for the patient that focused on problem situations to plan for in dietary management, and an assessment summary for the physician. The second part of the intervention was a 20 minute session with a research interventionist who assisted with patient-centered goal setting and problem solving with self-help materials. Participants repeated the program at their 3 month follow-up visit and received telephone reinforcements at 1 and 3 weeks and 6 months post baseline. At 1-year post-randomization, patients receiving the intervention had greater reduction in cholesterol and calories from fat, but no difference in HbA1c or BMI compared to the control group, who received computerized assessment and standard medical care only Costs were estimated at $137 per participant with an estimate of $8 per mg/dl reduction in serum cholesterol. The investigators argued that these costs are low compared to pharmacologic interventions. Over the past decade, Glasgow and colleagues have compared other iterations of their diabetes self-management program, moving it out of the office setting to a web-based delivery system that helps patients complete a self-directed diabetes program providing self-management information, automated goal setting, and problem solving. In 2003, the group published results of a 3-arm trial (basic web-based program vs. web-based program + peer support vs. web-based program + expert self-management coaching) in which all three groups showed significant baseline to 10 month improvements on 11/14 outcomes. They concluded that the basic program is effective and that neither peer support nor tailored self-management coaching added to the benefits of the program. However, without the use of a control group, it is impossible to know whether changes are a result of the web-based intervention or a result of other factors. Depression Proudfoot and colleagues have developed and tested the Beat the Blues (BtB) web-based CBT program for depression ( McCrone et al., 2004 ; Proudfoot et al., 2003 ; Proudfoot et al., 2004 ). Beating the Blues is an eight session self-help treatment program designed to be used by patients with no previous computer experience. Patients work through cognitive modules that help them to identify and challenge automatic thoughts that are counterproductive. Other modules focus on learning and practicing new behaviors such as activity scheduling, goal setting and problem solving, task breakdown, or sleep management. A final module helps the patient to work on action planning and relapse prevention. Beating the Blues includes a variety of approaches to engage users: interactive modules, animations and voice-overs and filmed case studies of fictional patients to model cognitive behavioral therapy. Although interaction with a clinician is not an explicit part of the program, it is designed to facilitate interactions by providing a printed summary of the patient’s work to the clinician at the end of each session. Proudfoot and colleagues reported significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and work and social adjustment ( Proudfoot et al., 2003 ; Proudfoot et al., 2004 ) at 1-, 3-, and 6- month follow-up compared to control patients receiving standard care as prescribed by their general practitioner. Beating the Blues was also found to be cost effective both in terms of cost per quality adjusted life year and lost employment costs ( McCrone et al., 2004 ). As a result of this work, the BtB program is now considered standard of care for those with mild-moderate depression in Great Britain (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2006). At the time of diagnosis, general practitioners can provide patients with free access to the BtB online program. Other chronic illnesses Lorig and colleagues ( Lorig, Ritter, Laurent, & Plant, 2006 , 2008 ) have conducted a series of studies that progressed from establishing the efficacy of face-to-face self-management programs for persons with chronic illness, to developing web-based programs using a similar model, to extending the program to different patient populations. The program includes content to help participants design individualized exercise programs; cognitive symptom management such as relaxation, visualization, distraction, and self talk; methods for managing negative emotions such as anger, fear, depression, and frustration; an overview of medications; strategies for improving patient-provider communication; healthy eating; fatigue management; action planning; feedback; and methods for solving problems that result from living with a chronic disease. Over six weeks, participants are asked to log on at least three times a week for a total of one to two hours and to participate in the activities for that week. Participants are asked to do several activities including reading the week’s content on web pages, posting an action plan on the bulletin board, checking in with a buddy via e-mail, and participating in self-tests and activities. They can post problems for discussion on the bulletin board, which invites responses from other members of the group as well as health care moderators. Lorig and colleagues reported that at 1 year follow up, participants in the intervention group had significantly greater improvements in health related distress, pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath compared to those in the control group receiving standard care (2006). Cancer Gustafson and colleagues ( Gustafson et al., 2001 ) at the University of Wisconsin were pioneers in the use of computers to enhance the care of patients with cancer. In 2001 they developed and tested the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) for women diagnosed with breast cancer. The web-based CHESS intervention was comprised of “Information Services” (answers to frequently asked questions; full articles on breast cancer; consumer guide to health services; referral directory to services); “Support Services” (peer discussion groups, Ask an Expert, and personal stories of how others facing breast cancer coped); and “Decision Services” (assessment of a person’s emotional status followed by coping advice; system for recording and tracking health changes; decision aid to learn about options, clarify values and understand consequences of choices; and goal setting and action planning). In this study, 246 women were randomly assigned to CHESS vs. care-as-usual (supplemented with Susan Love’s Breast Book). Participants in CHESS were given 6 months of access to the website. At 2 and 5 months follow-up, the study participants in CHESS scored significantly higher in social support and information competence than the control group. There were no significant difference between groups in four quality of life outcomes including social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and breast cancer concerns ( Gustafson et al., 2001 ). The authors also reported significant interactions based on race, education, and lack of insurance such that women of color, those with less education, and those without insurance saw greater improvements as a result of CHESS in social support, information support, and participation in healthcare. In summary, the use of theoretically guided components to enhance adoption of new behaviors (e.g. CBT, problem-solving, self-management, and counseling) seemed to improve multiple patient outcomes. In depression, computer-based CBT alone improved depression as long as efforts were included to ensure subjects used the site. For chronic diseases in which complex management or medication adjustment is necessary (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, CAD, cancer), expert medical advice or coaching was critical – few studies showed improved outcomes without providing contact with a trained expert. Very few studies evaluated mechanisms underlying intervention effects. Those that did identified level of engagement in the intervention (those who used it more – had better outcomes) as a predictor of improved outcomes ( McKay, King, Eakin, Seeley, & Glasgow, 2001 ). Additionally, self-efficacy seemed to be an important predictor of intervention effects. Patients who started with higher levels of self-efficacy or showed greater improvements in self-efficacy over time tended to have better outcomes ( Lorig et al., 2006 ). Those who were at increased risk for negative outcomes (e.g. poorly controlled blood sugar, poorly managed hypertension) also tended to have more benefit ( Grant et al., 2008 ; Owen et al., 2005 ). Finally, vulnerable patient populations (minorities, elderly, and those with low-incomes) seemed to gain the most benefit from computer-mediated patient education programs (Shea et al., 2005; Gustafson et al., 2001 ). A common critique of Internet-based health intervention research is that non-computer literate users will not be able to participate. The findings from this review are counter to this critique. Other reviews of the use of computer-mediated interventions have found them to be feasible and acceptable to patients/subjects in a wide variety of clinical populations and using a variety of technologies ( Krishna, Balas, Spencer, Griffin, & et al., 1997 ; Murray, Burns, See, Lai, & Nazareth, 2005 ). In an early and compelling call to ensure universal access to health information and support, Eng and colleagues (1998) argued that there is substantial data to show that members of underserved groups desire and will use health information technology, and that when barriers to access are removed and training is provided, underserved populations (including the elderly, residents of inner cities and rural areas, and racial and ethnic minorities) can all successfully use technology. C. Development of a computer-mediated symptom management program for women with recurrent ovarian cancer: WRITE Symptoms© Findings from this review suggest that computer-mediated interventions could be developed to support women with ovarian cancer. Results also provide important information on necessary intervention components as well as study design considerations. Based on these findings and the specific symptom management needs of women with ovarian cancer, Donovan and colleagues developed WRITE Symptoms© [Written Representational Intervention To Ease Symptoms]. WRITE Symptoms is a computer-mediated intervention that builds upon effective components of previous symptom management and computer-mediated interventions. It is based on the Representational Approach to patient education, a 7-element intervention aimed at facilitating conceptual change, which includes a comprehensive assessment of patient representations; explorations of gaps, concerns, or misconceptions; provision of evidence-based symptom management recommendations; assistance with goal setting and problem-solving, and follow-up and re-evaluation ( Donovan & Ward, 2001 ; Donovan et al., 2007 ). In its first iteration, WRITE Symptoms© was tested as a web-based delivery system through which patients were able to interact with a research nurse over their own private message boards. Using asynchronous postings, nurses led each patient through the WRITE Symptoms© intervention in order to develop individualized goals and strategies for improving symptom management. A pilot study of 65 women with recurrent ovarian cancer supported that the nurse-delivered WRITE Symptoms is a feasible, acceptable intervention, with preliminary evidence supporting baseline to 5- and 9- week improvements in symptom representation (severity, distress, and consequences) ( Donovan et al., 2008 ). A key question is whether individualization by nurses is critical to the success of the WRITE Symptoms© Intervention, or whether women can be guided through the program by a web-based, interactive computer module without assistance from a nurse (referred to as “ Self-directed WRITE Symptoms” ). In the second phase of intervention development, a web-based computer module was developed which leads patients through the same theoretical components as the nurse-delivered WRITE Symptoms intervention – guiding women through a self-assessment of their health problems, providing information on common concerns that women face when trying to manage multiple and complex symptoms, providing evidence based recommendations for symptom management, and guiding patients through a process of developing individualized goals and strategies to improve symptom management. A three-arm RCT is currently underway, funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research (R01 NR010735NINR) and supported as a Gynecologic Oncology Group Protocol (GOG-259), to compare the efficacy of these two different web-based delivery systems (nurse-delivered via private web-based message boards vs. self-directed using a web-based computer module) vs. usual care in a sample of 480 women with recurrent cancer recruited from Gynecologic Oncology Group sites across the United States. Primary outcomes are symptom representation (severity, distress, consequences) and quality of life. By carefully examining critical components of WRITE Symptoms©, the mechanisms through which it is effective, and for which individuals it is most effective, this study has the potential to advance the science of computer-mediated patient interventions and enhance cancer symptom management across diverse patient populations.

A key question is whether individualization by nurses is critical to the success of the WRITE Symptoms© Intervention, or whether women can be guided through the program by a web-based, interactive computer module without assistance from a nurse (referred to as “ Self-directed WRITE Symptoms” ). In the second phase of intervention development, a web-based computer module was developed which leads patients through the same theoretical components as the nurse-delivered WRITE Symptoms intervention – guiding women through a self-assessment of their health problems, providing information on common concerns that women face when trying to manage multiple and complex symptoms, providing evidence based recommendations for symptom management, and guiding patients through a process of developing individualized goals and strategies to improve symptom management. A three-arm RCT is currently underway, funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research (R01 NR010735NINR) and supported as a Gynecologic Oncology Group Protocol (GOG-259), to compare the efficacy of these two different web-based delivery systems (nurse-delivered via private web-based message boards vs. self-directed using a web-based computer module) vs. usual care in a sample of 480 women with recurrent cancer recruited from Gynecologic Oncology Group sites across the United States. Primary outcomes are symptom representation (severity, distress, consequences) and quality of life. By carefully examining critical components of WRITE Symptoms©, the mechanisms through which it is effective, and for which individuals it is most effective, this study has the potential to advance the science of computer-mediated patient interventions and enhance cancer symptom management across diverse patient populations.  A. Common Components of Computer-Mediated Patient Education Interventions Common components of interventions in the identified studies included provision of information, cognitive-behavioral approaches, skills training, peer support, expert advice, and communication training. Information was provided regarding the disease itself, associated symptoms, recommended treatments and/or management strategies. Cognitive behavioral approaches included formal cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as well as other theoretically guided components designed to enhance adoption of new behaviors. Common components in this category included goal setting, problem-solving, motivational interviewing, overcoming barriers, cognitive reframing, and self-management counseling. Skills training included practical “how to” information such as tips and skills for preparing nutritious foods, proper blood sugar monitoring techniques, and instructions on how to do relaxation or strengthening exercises. Peer support was another common component and included a variety of computer/internet tools to connect patients suffering from the same illness. Specific tools included chat rooms, discussion boards, e-mail systems, and peer coaching. Many studies included access to a health care expert as part of their intervention; this access ranged from providing as needed responses to patient-generated questions to conducting formal educational/counseling sessions at prescribed intervals. In some cases, computer-mediated activities with experts were supplemented by telephone or in-person contacts. Finally, several interventions specifically focused on improving patient-health care provider communication through self-advocacy or communication training. Table 1 provides a summary of the different categories of intervention components used in each of the reviewed studies. Information provision was the most common intervention component, followed by access to an expert, and teaching cognitive behavioral strategies.  A.

Effectiveness of Computer-Mediated Patient Education Interventions A wide range of outcomes were evaluated in the reviewed studies. For ease of synthesis, these outcomes were categorized as changes in: 1) knowledge and beliefs, 2) self-care behaviors, 3) social support, 4) patient health, and 5) health care utilization. Assessments of knowledge and beliefs included whether or not the patient retained provided information as well as the effect of interventions on concepts such as self-efficacy, barriers to change, and confidence. Measures of self-care behaviors were most common in studies of patients with diabetes and typically focused on assessments of dietary intake and physical activity. Other self-care behaviors that were measured included the use of stress management strategies and health care provider communication. Measures of patient health included both physical and emotional outcomes and varied by target population. Studies of diabetes focused on HbA1c, BMI, and cholesterol; depression studies focused on depression, anxiety, and functional outcomes; other studies included outcomes such as blood pressure, physical symptoms (pain and fatigue), disease-related distress, and quality of life. Few studies included assessments of perceived social support and health care outcomes. Table 1 includes a summary of the number of each type of outcomes that were assessed as well as the number of outcomes that were significantly improved in each of the studies. Healthcare utilization as an outcome is not included in the table, but is discussed in the following sections. Overall, computer-mediated interventions have been shown to be effective in improving both physical and mental health outcomes in persons with chronic health conditions, particularly when an expert interventionist is utilized. Exemplars of successful studies highlighting intervention components and delivery methods that were effective are provided in the following sections. Diabetes In diabetes, Shea and colleagues (2007) and Glasgow and colleagues ( Glasgow, Boles, McKay, Feil, & Barrera, 2003 ; Glasgow et al., 1997 ; Glasgow et al., 2005 ; Glasgow et al., 2004 ; Glasgow et al., 2006 ; Glasgow & Toobert, 2000 ) evaluated two different approaches to computer-mediated patient education. To test the “Informatics for Diabetes and Education Telemedicine” (IDEATEL) intervention, Shea et al. recruited 1665 Medicare recipients with diabetes, aged 55 years or older, and living in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York. Over 75% of patients did not know how to use a computer and 93% reported a median income of <$20,000. Patients assigned to the intervention were provided with computers and telemedicine units in their homes and participated in a range of activities that included: 1) videoconferencing between patients and a nurse case manager; 2) remote glucose monitoring with electronic upload and integration with the patients electronic medical record; 3) access to a web portal that contained their own clinical data and secure web-based messaging with nurse case managers; and 4) access to an educational web site created for the project (regular and low literacy versions). One year post-intervention, participants in the IDEATEL intervention had significantly greater reductions in HbA1C, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol than those in the control group, who received standard care. Effects were strongest for participants who had HbA1c levels > 7 at baseline. The authors noted that Medicare claims were higher in the intervention group compared to control – an issue that warrants further exploration. The authors hypothesized that providing patients in medically underserved areas with access to nurse case managers may have provided patients with the advice and encouragement to seek needed care that they had not previously been receiving. A particular strength of this project was the focus on an underserved patient population and the provision of computers to patients with no previous computer experience. Their findings provide important support for the generalizability of computer-mediated interventions, demonstrating that older, low income patients without computer experience are willing to use and can benefit from computer-mediated education and disease management. The work of Glasgow and colleagues is noteworthy for the investigators’ efforts to create cost-effective studies that are highly generalizable. These researchers at the Oregon Research Institute (ORI) have developed a series of “practical clinical trials”. Practical clinical trials are designed with clinically relevant interventions as control conditions, include a diverse patient population (broad study inclusion criteria), and recruit from heterogeneous practice settings ( Tunis, Stryer, & Clancy, 2003 ). The ORI studies have emphasized interventions that could move quickly to widespread adoption by virtue of being brief, fitting into the realities of clinic visits, and reducing demands on physician ( Glasgow et al., 2004 ). Glasgow and colleagues began their computer-mediated diabetes education programs in 1997 with an intervention that included two parts. The first was a brief (5- to 10- minute) computer based assessment and feedback on dietary patterns, key barriers for dietary self-management, and preferences for self-care strategies. Two printouts were generated, one for the patient that focused on problem situations to plan for in dietary management, and an assessment summary for the physician. The second part of the intervention was a 20 minute session with a research interventionist who assisted with patient-centered goal setting and problem solving with self-help materials. Participants repeated the program at their 3 month follow-up visit and received telephone reinforcements at 1 and 3 weeks and 6 months post baseline. At 1-year post-randomization, patients receiving the intervention had greater reduction in cholesterol and calories from fat, but no difference in HbA1c or BMI compared to the control group, who received computerized assessment and standard medical care only Costs were estimated at $137 per participant with an estimate of $8 per mg/dl reduction in serum cholesterol. The investigators argued that these costs are low compared to pharmacologic interventions. Over the past decade, Glasgow and colleagues have compared other iterations of their diabetes self-management program, moving it out of the office setting to a web-based delivery system that helps patients complete a self-directed diabetes program providing self-management information, automated goal setting, and problem solving. In 2003, the group published results of a 3-arm trial (basic web-based program vs. web-based program + peer support vs. web-based program + expert self-management coaching) in which all three groups showed significant baseline to 10 month improvements on 11/14 outcomes. They concluded that the basic program is effective and that neither peer support nor tailored self-management coaching added to the benefits of the program. However, without the use of a control group, it is impossible to know whether changes are a result of the web-based intervention or a result of other factors. Depression Proudfoot and colleagues have developed and tested the Beat the Blues (BtB) web-based CBT program for depression ( McCrone et al., 2004 ; Proudfoot et al., 2003 ; Proudfoot et al., 2004 ). Beating the Blues is an eight session self-help treatment program designed to be used by patients with no previous computer experience. Patients work through cognitive modules that help them to identify and challenge automatic thoughts that are counterproductive. Other modules focus on learning and practicing new behaviors such as activity scheduling, goal setting and problem solving, task breakdown, or sleep management. A final module helps the patient to work on action planning and relapse prevention. Beating the Blues includes a variety of approaches to engage users: interactive modules, animations and voice-overs and filmed case studies of fictional patients to model cognitive behavioral therapy. Although interaction with a clinician is not an explicit part of the program, it is designed to facilitate interactions by providing a printed summary of the patient’s work to the clinician at the end of each session. Proudfoot and colleagues reported significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and work and social adjustment ( Proudfoot et al., 2003 ; Proudfoot et al., 2004 ) at 1-, 3-, and 6- month follow-up compared to control patients receiving standard care as prescribed by their general practitioner. Beating the Blues was also found to be cost effective both in terms of cost per quality adjusted life year and lost employment costs ( McCrone et al., 2004 ). As a result of this work, the BtB program is now considered standard of care for those with mild-moderate depression in Great Britain (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2006). At the time of diagnosis, general practitioners can provide patients with free access to the BtB online program. Other chronic illnesses Lorig and colleagues ( Lorig, Ritter, Laurent, & Plant, 2006 , 2008 ) have conducted a series of studies that progressed from establishing the efficacy of face-to-face self-management programs for persons with chronic illness, to developing web-based programs using a similar model, to extending the program to different patient populations. The program includes content to help participants design individualized exercise programs; cognitive symptom management such as relaxation, visualization, distraction, and self talk; methods for managing negative emotions such as anger, fear, depression, and frustration; an overview of medications; strategies for improving patient-provider communication; healthy eating; fatigue management; action planning; feedback; and methods for solving problems that result from living with a chronic disease. Over six weeks, participants are asked to log on at least three times a week for a total of one to two hours and to participate in the activities for that week. Participants are asked to do several activities including reading the week’s content on web pages, posting an action plan on the bulletin board, checking in with a buddy via e-mail, and participating in self-tests and activities. They can post problems for discussion on the bulletin board, which invites responses from other members of the group as well as health care moderators. Lorig and colleagues reported that at 1 year follow up, participants in the intervention group had significantly greater improvements in health related distress, pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath compared to those in the control group receiving standard care (2006). Cancer Gustafson and colleagues ( Gustafson et al., 2001 ) at the University of Wisconsin were pioneers in the use of computers to enhance the care of patients with cancer. In 2001 they developed and tested the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) for women diagnosed with breast cancer. The web-based CHESS intervention was comprised of “Information Services” (answers to frequently asked questions; full articles on breast cancer; consumer guide to health services; referral directory to services); “Support Services” (peer discussion groups, Ask an Expert, and personal stories of how others facing breast cancer coped); and “Decision Services” (assessment of a person’s emotional status followed by coping advice; system for recording and tracking health changes; decision aid to learn about options, clarify values and understand consequences of choices; and goal setting and action planning). In this study, 246 women were randomly assigned to CHESS vs. care-as-usual (supplemented with Susan Love’s Breast Book). Participants in CHESS were given 6 months of access to the website. At 2 and 5 months follow-up, the study participants in CHESS scored significantly higher in social support and information competence than the control group. There were no significant difference between groups in four quality of life outcomes including social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and breast cancer concerns ( Gustafson et al., 2001 ). The authors also reported significant interactions based on race, education, and lack of insurance such that women of color, those with less education, and those without insurance saw greater improvements as a result of CHESS in social support, information support, and participation in healthcare. In summary, the use of theoretically guided components to enhance adoption of new behaviors (e.g. CBT, problem-solving, self-management, and counseling) seemed to improve multiple patient outcomes. In depression, computer-based CBT alone improved depression as long as efforts were included to ensure subjects used the site. For chronic diseases in which complex management or medication adjustment is necessary (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, CAD, cancer), expert medical advice or coaching was critical – few studies showed improved outcomes without providing contact with a trained expert. Very few studies evaluated mechanisms underlying intervention effects. Those that did identified level of engagement in the intervention (those who used it more – had better outcomes) as a predictor of improved outcomes ( McKay, King, Eakin, Seeley, & Glasgow, 2001 ). Additionally, self-efficacy seemed to be an important predictor of intervention effects. Patients who started with higher levels of self-efficacy or showed greater improvements in self-efficacy over time tended to have better outcomes ( Lorig et al., 2006 ). Those who were at increased risk for negative outcomes (e.g. poorly controlled blood sugar, poorly managed hypertension) also tended to have more benefit ( Grant et al., 2008 ; Owen et al., 2005 ). Finally, vulnerable patient populations (minorities, elderly, and those with low-incomes) seemed to gain the most benefit from computer-mediated patient education programs (Shea et al., 2005; Gustafson et al., 2001 ). A common critique of Internet-based health intervention research is that non-computer literate users will not be able to participate. The findings from this review are counter to this critique. Other reviews of the use of computer-mediated interventions have found them to be feasible and acceptable to patients/subjects in a wide variety of clinical populations and using a variety of technologies ( Krishna, Balas, Spencer, Griffin, & et al., 1997 ; Murray, Burns, See, Lai, & Nazareth, 2005 ). In an early and compelling call to ensure universal access to health information and support, Eng and colleagues (1998) argued that there is substantial data to show that members of underserved groups desire and will use health information technology, and that when barriers to access are removed and training is provided, underserved populations (including the elderly, residents of inner cities and rural areas, and racial and ethnic minorities) can all successfully use technology.  B. Effectiveness of Computer-Mediated Patient Education Interventions A wide range of outcomes were evaluated in the reviewed studies.

At 1-year post-randomization, patients receiving the intervention had greater reduction in cholesterol and calories from fat, but no difference in HbA1c or BMI compared to the control group, who received computerized assessment and standard medical care only Costs were estimated at $137 per participant with an estimate of $8 per mg/dl reduction in serum cholesterol. The investigators argued that these costs are low compared to pharmacologic interventions. Over the past decade, Glasgow and colleagues have compared other iterations of their diabetes self-management program, moving it out of the office setting to a web-based delivery system that helps patients complete a self-directed diabetes program providing self-management information, automated goal setting, and problem solving. In 2003, the group published results of a 3-arm trial (basic web-based program vs. web-based program + peer support vs. web-based program + expert self-management coaching) in which all three groups showed significant baseline to 10 month improvements on 11/14 outcomes. They concluded that the basic program is effective and that neither peer support nor tailored self-management coaching added to the benefits of the program. However, without the use of a control group, it is impossible to know whether changes are a result of the web-based intervention or a result of other factors.  Diabetes In diabetes, Shea and colleagues (2007) and Glasgow and colleagues ( Glasgow, Boles, McKay, Feil, & Barrera, 2003 ; Glasgow et al., 1997 ; Glasgow et al., 2005 ; Glasgow et al., 2004 ; Glasgow et al., 2006 ; Glasgow & Toobert, 2000 ) evaluated two different approaches to computer-mediated patient education. To test the “Informatics for Diabetes and Education Telemedicine” (IDEATEL) intervention, Shea et al. recruited 1665 Medicare recipients with diabetes, aged 55 years or older, and living in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York. Over 75% of patients did not know how to use a computer and 93% reported a median income of <$20,000. Patients assigned to the intervention were provided with computers and telemedicine units in their homes and participated in a range of activities that included: 1) videoconferencing between patients and a nurse case manager; 2) remote glucose monitoring with electronic upload and integration with the patients electronic medical record; 3) access to a web portal that contained their own clinical data and secure web-based messaging with nurse case managers; and 4) access to an educational web site created for the project (regular and low literacy versions). One year post-intervention, participants in the IDEATEL intervention had significantly greater reductions in HbA1C, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol than those in the control group, who received standard care. Effects were strongest for participants who had HbA1c levels > 7 at baseline. The authors noted that Medicare claims were higher in the intervention group compared to control – an issue that warrants further exploration. The authors hypothesized that providing patients in medically underserved areas with access to nurse case managers may have provided patients with the advice and encouragement to seek needed care that they had not previously been receiving. A particular strength of this project was the focus on an underserved patient population and the provision of computers to patients with no previous computer experience. Their findings provide important support for the generalizability of computer-mediated interventions, demonstrating that older, low income patients without computer experience are willing to use and can benefit from computer-mediated education and disease management. The work of Glasgow and colleagues is noteworthy for the investigators’ efforts to create cost-effective studies that are highly generalizable. These researchers at the Oregon Research Institute (ORI) have developed a series of “practical clinical trials”. Practical clinical trials are designed with clinically relevant interventions as control conditions, include a diverse patient population (broad study inclusion criteria), and recruit from heterogeneous practice settings ( Tunis, Stryer, & Clancy, 2003 ). The ORI studies have emphasized interventions that could move quickly to widespread adoption by virtue of being brief, fitting into the realities of clinic visits, and reducing demands on physician ( Glasgow et al., 2004 ). Glasgow and colleagues began their computer-mediated diabetes education programs in 1997 with an intervention that included two parts. The first was a brief (5- to 10- minute) computer based assessment and feedback on dietary patterns, key barriers for dietary self-management, and preferences for self-care strategies. Two printouts were generated, one for the patient that focused on problem situations to plan for in dietary management, and an assessment summary for the physician. The second part of the intervention was a 20 minute session with a research interventionist who assisted with patient-centered goal setting and problem solving with self-help materials. Participants repeated the program at their 3 month follow-up visit and received telephone reinforcements at 1 and 3 weeks and 6 months post baseline.

However, without the use of a control group, it is impossible to know whether changes are a result of the web-based intervention or a result of other factors.  Depression Proudfoot and colleagues have developed and tested the Beat the Blues (BtB) web-based CBT program for depression ( McCrone et al., 2004 ; Proudfoot et al., 2003 ; Proudfoot et al., 2004 ). Beating the Blues is an eight session self-help treatment program designed to be used by patients with no previous computer experience. Patients work through cognitive modules that help them to identify and challenge automatic thoughts that are counterproductive. Other modules focus on learning and practicing new behaviors such as activity scheduling, goal setting and problem solving, task breakdown, or sleep management. A final module helps the patient to work on action planning and relapse prevention. Beating the Blues includes a variety of approaches to engage users: interactive modules, animations and voice-overs and filmed case studies of fictional patients to model cognitive behavioral therapy. Although interaction with a clinician is not an explicit part of the program, it is designed to facilitate interactions by providing a printed summary of the patient’s work to the clinician at the end of each session. Proudfoot and colleagues reported significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and work and social adjustment ( Proudfoot et al., 2003 ; Proudfoot et al., 2004 ) at 1-, 3-, and 6- month follow-up compared to control patients receiving standard care as prescribed by their general practitioner. Beating the Blues was also found to be cost effective both in terms of cost per quality adjusted life year and lost employment costs ( McCrone et al., 2004 ). As a result of this work, the BtB program is now considered standard of care for those with mild-moderate depression in Great Britain (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2006). At the time of diagnosis, general practitioners can provide patients with free access to the BtB online program.

Other chronic illnesses Lorig and colleagues ( Lorig, Ritter, Laurent, & Plant, 2006 , 2008 ) have conducted a series of studies that progressed from establishing the efficacy of face-to-face self-management programs for persons with chronic illness, to developing web-based programs using a similar model, to extending the program to different patient populations. The program includes content to help participants design individualized exercise programs; cognitive symptom management such as relaxation, visualization, distraction, and self talk; methods for managing negative emotions such as anger, fear, depression, and frustration; an overview of medications; strategies for improving patient-provider communication; healthy eating; fatigue management; action planning; feedback; and methods for solving problems that result from living with a chronic disease. Over six weeks, participants are asked to log on at least three times a week for a total of one to two hours and to participate in the activities for that week. Participants are asked to do several activities including reading the week’s content on web pages, posting an action plan on the bulletin board, checking in with a buddy via e-mail, and participating in self-tests and activities. They can post problems for discussion on the bulletin board, which invites responses from other members of the group as well as health care moderators. Lorig and colleagues reported that at 1 year follow up, participants in the intervention group had significantly greater improvements in health related distress, pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath compared to those in the control group receiving standard care (2006).

Cancer Gustafson and colleagues ( Gustafson et al., 2001 ) at the University of Wisconsin were pioneers in the use of computers to enhance the care of patients with cancer. In 2001 they developed and tested the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) for women diagnosed with breast cancer. The web-based CHESS intervention was comprised of “Information Services” (answers to frequently asked questions; full articles on breast cancer; consumer guide to health services; referral directory to services); “Support Services” (peer discussion groups, Ask an Expert, and personal stories of how others facing breast cancer coped); and “Decision Services” (assessment of a person’s emotional status followed by coping advice; system for recording and tracking health changes; decision aid to learn about options, clarify values and understand consequences of choices; and goal setting and action planning). In this study, 246 women were randomly assigned to CHESS vs. care-as-usual (supplemented with Susan Love’s Breast Book). Participants in CHESS were given 6 months of access to the website. At 2 and 5 months follow-up, the study participants in CHESS scored significantly higher in social support and information competence than the control group. There were no significant difference between groups in four quality of life outcomes including social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and breast cancer concerns ( Gustafson et al., 2001 ). The authors also reported significant interactions based on race, education, and lack of insurance such that women of color, those with less education, and those without insurance saw greater improvements as a result of CHESS in social support, information support, and participation in healthcare. In summary, the use of theoretically guided components to enhance adoption of new behaviors (e.g. CBT, problem-solving, self-management, and counseling) seemed to improve multiple patient outcomes. In depression, computer-based CBT alone improved depression as long as efforts were included to ensure subjects used the site. For chronic diseases in which complex management or medication adjustment is necessary (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, CAD, cancer), expert medical advice or coaching was critical – few studies showed improved outcomes without providing contact with a trained expert. Very few studies evaluated mechanisms underlying intervention effects. Those that did identified level of engagement in the intervention (those who used it more – had better outcomes) as a predictor of improved outcomes ( McKay, King, Eakin, Seeley, & Glasgow, 2001 ). Additionally, self-efficacy seemed to be an important predictor of intervention effects. Patients who started with higher levels of self-efficacy or showed greater improvements in self-efficacy over time tended to have better outcomes ( Lorig et al., 2006 ). Those who were at increased risk for negative outcomes (e.g. poorly controlled blood sugar, poorly managed hypertension) also tended to have more benefit ( Grant et al., 2008 ; Owen et al., 2005 ). Finally, vulnerable patient populations (minorities, elderly, and those with low-incomes) seemed to gain the most benefit from computer-mediated patient education programs (Shea et al., 2005; Gustafson et al., 2001 ). A common critique of Internet-based health intervention research is that non-computer literate users will not be able to participate. The findings from this review are counter to this critique. Other reviews of the use of computer-mediated interventions have found them to be feasible and acceptable to patients/subjects in a wide variety of clinical populations and using a variety of technologies ( Krishna, Balas, Spencer, Griffin, & et al., 1997 ; Murray, Burns, See, Lai, & Nazareth, 2005 ). In an early and compelling call to ensure universal access to health information and support, Eng and colleagues (1998) argued that there is substantial data to show that members of underserved groups desire and will use health information technology, and that when barriers to access are removed and training is provided, underserved populations (including the elderly, residents of inner cities and rural areas, and racial and ethnic minorities) can all successfully use technology.

C. Development of a computer-mediated symptom management program for women with recurrent ovarian cancer: WRITE Symptoms© Findings from this review suggest that computer-mediated interventions could be developed to support women with ovarian cancer. Results also provide important information on necessary intervention components as well as study design considerations. Based on these findings and the specific symptom management needs of women with ovarian cancer, Donovan and colleagues developed WRITE Symptoms© [Written Representational Intervention To Ease Symptoms]. WRITE Symptoms is a computer-mediated intervention that builds upon effective components of previous symptom management and computer-mediated interventions. It is based on the Representational Approach to patient education, a 7-element intervention aimed at facilitating conceptual change, which includes a comprehensive assessment of patient representations; explorations of gaps, concerns, or misconceptions; provision of evidence-based symptom management recommendations; assistance with goal setting and problem-solving, and follow-up and re-evaluation ( Donovan & Ward, 2001 ; Donovan et al., 2007 ). In its first iteration, WRITE Symptoms© was tested as a web-based delivery system through which patients were able to interact with a research nurse over their own private message boards. Using asynchronous postings, nurses led each patient through the WRITE Symptoms© intervention in order to develop individualized goals and strategies for improving symptom management. A pilot study of 65 women with recurrent ovarian cancer supported that the nurse-delivered WRITE Symptoms is a feasible, acceptable intervention, with preliminary evidence supporting baseline to 5- and 9- week improvements in symptom representation (severity, distress, and consequences) ( Donovan et al., 2008 ). A key question is whether individualization by nurses is critical to the success of the WRITE Symptoms© Intervention, or whether women can be guided through the program by a web-based, interactive computer module without assistance from a nurse (referred to as “ Self-directed WRITE Symptoms” ). In the second phase of intervention development, a web-based computer module was developed which leads patients through the same theoretical components as the nurse-delivered WRITE Symptoms intervention – guiding women through a self-assessment of their health problems, providing information on common concerns that women face when trying to manage multiple and complex symptoms, providing evidence based recommendations for symptom management, and guiding patients through a process of developing individualized goals and strategies to improve symptom management. A three-arm RCT is currently underway, funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research (R01 NR010735NINR) and supported as a Gynecologic Oncology Group Protocol (GOG-259), to compare the efficacy of these two different web-based delivery systems (nurse-delivered via private web-based message boards vs. self-directed using a web-based computer module) vs. usual care in a sample of 480 women with recurrent cancer recruited from Gynecologic Oncology Group sites across the United States. Primary outcomes are symptom representation (severity, distress, consequences) and quality of life. By carefully examining critical components of WRITE Symptoms©, the mechanisms through which it is effective, and for which individuals it is most effective, this study has the potential to advance the science of computer-mediated patient interventions and enhance cancer symptom management across diverse patient populations.
