Growth Factors and Targeted Therapy for Malignant Glioma Patients: Lessons Learned and the Road Ahead Molecularly targeted therapies are transforming the care of patients with malignant gliomas, including glioblastoma, the most common malignant primary brain tumor of adults. With an arsenal of small molecule inhibitors and antibodies that target key components of the signal transduction machinery that are commonly activated in gliomas, neuro-oncologists and neurosurgeons are poised to transform the care of these patients. Yet, the successful application of targeted therapies remains a challenge. Strategies are lacking for directing kinase inhibitor or other pathway-specific therapies to individual patients most likely to benefit. In addition, response to targeted agents is determined not only by the presence of the key mutant kinases, but also by other critical changes in the molecular circuitry of cancer cells; e.g. such as loss of key tumor suppressor proteins, the selection for kinase resistant mutants and the deregulation of feedback loops. Understanding these networks, and studying them in patients, will be critical for developing rational combination therapies to suppress resistance for malignant glioma patients. Here we review the current status of molecular targeted therapies for malignant gliomas. We focus initially on identifying some of the insights learned so far from targeting the EGFR/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in patients and on how this has lead towards a re-conceptualization of some of the new challenges and new directions for targeted treatment. We describe how new advances from the world of genomics have the potential to transform our approach towards targeted therapies, and describe how a deeper understanding of the complex nature of cancer, its adeptness at re-wiring molecular circuitry to evade targeted agents, has raised new challenges and identified new leads.
