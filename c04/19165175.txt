Uremic cardiac hypertrophy is reversed by rapamycin but not by lowering of blood pressure Chronic kidney disease is often complicated by uremic cardiomyopathy that consists of left ventricular hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. It is thought that hypertension and volume overload are major causes of this disease, but here we sought to identify additional mechanisms using a mouse model of chronic renal insufficiency. Mice with a remnant kidney developed an elevated blood urea nitrogen by 1 week, as expected, and showed progressive cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis at 4 and 8 weeks even though their blood pressures were not elevated nor did they show signs of volume overload. Cardiac extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was activated in the uremic animals at 8 weeks. There was also an increased phosphorylation of S6 kinase, which is often mediated by activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). To test the involvement of this pathway, we treated these uremic mice with rapamycin and found that it reduced cardiac hypertrophy. Reduction of blood pressure, however, by hydralazine had no effect. These studies suggest that uremic cardiomyopathy is mediated by activation of a pathway that involves the mTOR pathway.  METHODS SIRI in mice All research involving the use of mice were performed in strict accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University School of Medicine. At 12 weeks of age, male 129/SvJ mice were randomized to undergo SIRI (SIRI; n =31) or sham surgery ( n =14). Mice were anesthetized, and an incision in the right flank was performed followed by surgical dissection to expose the right kidney. Capsulectomy preceded unilateral ablation of 60–70% of the cortical surface of the right kidney by Bovie cauterization. 25 After a 2-week recovery period, a left flank incision was made and left total nephrectomy in anesthetized mice was performed. Sham procedures involved abdominal incisions in the same flank locations of approach. Quantitation of body fluid constituents and body composition Serum aldosterone levels were determined by the University of Michigan Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Serum angiotensin II was measured at the Medical College of Wisconsin by radioimmunoassay following HPLC separation of angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and the primary angiotensin metabolites as previously described by Mattson and colleagues. 27 Calorie intake was measured with a metabolic cage apparatus over a 24-h period. Urine sodium was measured at Advanced Veterinary Laboratories in St. Louis, Missouri. Serum creatinine was measured by Stephen Dunn at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by use of HPLC with the following modifications: (1) column was Zorbax 300-SCX, 5 micron, 2.1×150mm; (2) mobile phase was 7.5mM sodium acetate adjusted to pH 4.4 with acetic acid (total acetate ~15mM) at a flow rate of 0.50ml/min (isocratic); (3) column temperature of 40°C; and (4) sample injection volume was 3.0 ?l. 28 Lean body mass was measured by EchoMRI 3-in-1 (Echo Medical Systems, Houston, TX) at 8 weeks after SIRI. Afterward, extracellular volume was estimated by measuring the volume of distribution of sucrose using dilutional technique. 29 – 31 Rapamycin administration after SIRI A separate population of 17 animals subject to SIRI were monitored for 4 weeks after surgery and subsequently randomized to rapamycin (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA, USA) injection or vehicle injection. We treated mice with rapamycin beginning 4 weeks after surgery. Those receiving rapamycin were administered daily subcutaneous abdominal injections of rapamycin (2 mg/kg/day) in 50% DMSO 50% saline vehicle. 18 Seven control animals were administered daily injections of 75 ? l of a DMSO/saline vehicle by use of the same technique. Murine echocardiography Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in mice that were awake by use of an Acuson Sequoia 256 Echocardiography System equipped with a 15-MHz (15L8) transducer as described previously (Acuson, A Siemens Company, Malvern, PA, USA). 22 , 23 The echocardiographer was blinded in all cases to the experimental status of the mice. Murine hemodynamic monitoring Cardiac catheterization was performed on anesthetized mice as previously described. 32 , 33 In brief, mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and a 1.4-French Millar catheter was placed in the left carotid artery then advanced into the left ventricle. Cardiac morphometry and histology Mice were weighed, and hearts and tibiae were isolated. Cardiac chambers were dissected and washed in 10mM PBS. Biventricular and LV weights were obtained. Tissue microtomes were selected to approximate the maximum coronal diameter of each heart. H&E and trichrome staining was performed. Myocyte cross-sectional area was then calculated using 3–5 random high power fields in the lateroanterior region of 4 different mice per group. This was performed with an Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Jena, Germany) with ImageJ (version 1.24) software. Gene expression analysis Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis on RNA extracted from heart lysates with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was carried out with the Taqman master mix kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. The measured abundances of atrial natriuretic factor and ?-myosin heavy chain mRNA were normalized to GAPDH in each sample as an internal loading control. Protein analysis Cytosolic protein lysates from cardiac ventricular tissue were obtained as previously described. 22 , 23 In brief, ventricular tissue was harvested from mice and prepared for immunoblot analysis. Primary antibodies employed included murine monoclonal anti-phospho-p42/44 (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-phospho- Akt (Ser473), anti-phospho-ribosomal s6 (Ser235/236), anti-phospho- ribosomal 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) (Thr37/46), and anti-alpha-actin antibody. Filters were extensively washed in TBS/T and were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham, a GE Healthcare Company, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Bands were visualized by use of the ECL system (Amersham). Statistical analysis All statistical analysis was performed with SigmaStat-3.1 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Statistical relationships were determined by the Student’s t-test, where significance was achieved when a population’s mean value was separated from controls by two or more standard deviations ( P =0.05). All P values calculated were two-sided. Bonferroni correction was used in analysis of echocardiographic and morophometric data requiring 2.5 or more standard deviations from control values ( P =0.021).

RESULTS Surgically induced renal injury in mice To determine whether CKD in mice results in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, we studied the effect of surgically induced renal injury (SIRI) on 12-week-old 129/SvJ mice. In this method, the right kidney was injured by cauterization, and a left nephrectomy was performed after 2 weeks. The surgery was well tolerated by wild type 129/SvJ mice and no mortality was observed. The metabolic status of mice was determined both 4 and 8 weeks after the completion of SIRI or sham surgery ( Table 1 ). The serum creatinine was significantly increased in SIRI mice compared with sham animals at both 4- and 8-week time points. Four weeks after surgery, the serum creatinine was 0.71±0.006 in sham animals but was increased to 0.133±0.015 in SIRI mice ( P =0.003; Table 1 ). Eight weeks after surgery, the serum creatinine was 0.104±0.007 in sham mice but was increased 30.7% to 0.136±0.018 in SIRI mice ( P =0.016). Similarly, the BUN was significantly increased in SIRI mice at both the 4- and 8-week time points ( Table 1 ). Four weeks after surgery, the serum BUN was 16.0±4.1 mg/100 ml in sham mice but was increased to 54.0±4 mg/dl in SIRI animals ( P =0.00003). Eight weeks after surgery, the serum BUN was 22±1 mg/100 ml in sham mice but was increased to 83±3 mg/dl in SIRI animals ( P =0.0001). A three- to four-fold increase in urine output was noted in SIRI animals compared with sham-operated animals at both 4 and 8 weeks after surgery ( Table 1 ). Serum aldosterone levels were significantly increased in SIRI mice compared with sham mice at both the 4- and 8-week time points ( P =0.042), and this was associated with significantly elevated urine sodium loss ( P =0.041). Serum angiotensin II levels were transiently elevated in SIRI mice compared with sham mice 4 weeks after surgery ( P =0.013) but were significantly reduced in SIRI mice compared with sham mice at the 8-week time point ( P =0.0001; Table 1 ). 20 , 21 Serum potassium was significantly decreased in SIRI mice to 3.9±0.1mmol/l, compared with 4.7±0.2mmol/l in sham-operated mice ( P =0.01; Table 1 ). The body weight did not change after surgery and was 25.1±0.6 g in SIRI mice compared with 24.7±0.9 g in sham animals at the 8-week time point ( P =0.51; Table 2 ). Interestingly, SIRI mice ate 42.5% more food than sham-operated animals ( Table 2 ). Despite their increased food intake, SIRI mice had similar body composition to sham-operated mice. Measurement of muscle and fat mass by MRI demonstrated that the lean body mass of SIRI mice was 19.2±1.2 g 8 weeks after surgery and was 20.3±0.8 g in sham-operated mice ( P =0.47; Table 2 ). Finally, the extracellular fluid volume was nearly identical in SIRI and sham-operated mice 8 weeks after surgery ( Table 2 ). Development of cardiac hypertrophy after SIRI To evaluate the development of cardiac hypertrophy after SIRI, sequential transthoracic echocardiography was performed on unanesthetized mice 4 and 8 weeks after SIRI or sham surgery. LV systolic function, measured as fractional shortening, was nearly identical in SIRI and sham-operated mice at both time points ( Table 3 ). The echocardiographically determined LV mass index increased from 3.22±0.08 mg/g in sham-operated animals to 3.78±0.14 mg/g in SIRI animals 4 weeks after surgery was completed ( P =0.003). Similarly, at 8 weeks after surgery, the LV mass index increased from 3.20±0.15 mg/g in sham-operated animals to 3.96±0.11 mg/g in SIRI animals ( P =0.001). To confirm whether SIRI promoted cardiac hypertrophy, we weighed heart tissue of SIRI and control mice 8 weeks after surgery ( Table 4 ). The biventricular weight-to-tibial length ratio was increased from 6.3±0.1 mg/mm in sham-operated mice to 7.4±0.3 mg/mm in SIRI animals ( P =0.012). Furthermore, the LV weight-to-tibial length ratio increased from 5.0±0.18 mg/mm sham mice compared with 5.9±0.22 mg/mm in SIRI mice ( P =0.006; Table 4 ). To evaluate whether SIRI promoted the growth of individual cardiomyocytes and the deposition of extracellular matrix in cardiac tissue, we completed a histologic analysis of ventricular tissue sections. Cardiomyocyte area increased by 119% in SIRI mice when compared with sham-operated animals 8 weeks after surgery ( P =0.0001; Figure 1 ). Furthermore, cardiac fibrosis, evaluated in Masson’s trichrome-stained ventricular sections, increased by 120% in SIRI mice 8 weeks after surgery ( P =0.0001; Figure 2 ). To better evaluate cardiac systolic and diastolic function, we performed cardiac catheterization on anesthetized SIRI and control mice 8 weeks after surgery was completed. These studies demonstrated that LV systolic function, measured by determining +d P /d T max, was unchanged in SIRI mice (8844±667mmHg/s) when compared with sham-operated mice (8758±856mmHg/s) 8 weeks after surgery ( Table 5 ). Furthermore, diastolic function, measured as ? (Glantz), was similar in both SIRI and sham-operated mice 8 weeks after surgery. Systolic blood pressure, measured by determining the peak LV systolic pressure, was 139±11mmHg in sham-operated mice and was similar at 141±12mmHg in SIRI mice ( P =NS). Furthermore, SIRI mice were found to be normotensive by tail cuff blood pressure measurements and also by determination of carotid artery pressures with a Millar catheter ( Table 5 ). To determine whether a reduction in blood pressure would affect the development of cardiac hypertrophy after SIRI, mice were administered the arterial vasodilator hydralazine. Mice were administered hydralazine in their drinking water for 8 weeks after the completion of surgery to deliver a daily dose of 0.001 mg/g. Systolic blood pressure, determined by cardiac catheterization (LVPmax), was significantly lower in hydralazine-treated SIRI animals (101±11mmHg) when compared with untreated SIRI animals (141±12mmHg; P =0.037) or untreated sham-operated animals (139±11mmHg; P =0.032; Table 6 ). However, the development of cardiac hypertrophy in SIRI mice was unaffected by hydralazine administration. Indeed, the LV weight-to-tibial length ratio was 5.8±0.15 mg/mm in hydralazine-treated SIRI mice, compared with 5.0±0.2 mg/mm in untreated sham-operated mice ( P =0.004; Table 6 ). Cardiac molecular adaptations in response to SIRI To evaluate whether the LVH observed in SIRI mice was associated with changes in cardiac gene expression, the expression of marker genes was evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 22 , 23 The concentration of mRNAs encoding atrial natriuretic factor and ?-myosin heavy chain in cardiac tissue correlate with the degree of pathological hypertrophy. 22 , 23 The concentration of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA was increased by 94% in LV tissue obtained from SIRI mice 2 weeks after surgery ( P =0.012; Figure 3 ). The LV concentration of ?-myosin heavy chain mRNA increased by 209% 2 weeks after surgery ( P =0.001). The mRNA levels of both genes returned to baseline 8 weeks after surgery ( Figure 3 ). To determine whether SIRI modulates the activation of intracellular signaling cascades in cardiac tissue, we obtained ventricular lysates 8 weeks after SIRI or sham surgery. Immunoblot analysis of ventricular lysates with phospho-specific antibodies was performed to evaluate the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2, ribosomal S6 protein, and 4E-BP1 ( Figure 4 ). The phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein and 4E-BP1 are markers of mTOR activation. 16 These experiments demonstrated that ERK1 and ERK2 activation was significantly increased in SIRI ventricular tissue 8 weeks after surgery ( P =0.011 for ERK1, P =0.007 for ERK2). Furthermore, S6 protein and a subfraction of 4E-BP1 (4E-BP1.2) phosphorylation were increased 8 weeks after surgery in SIRI mice ( P =0.002 for S6 protein, P =0.016 for 4E-BP1.2). Rapamycin treatment of SIRI mice SIRI resulted in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and was associated with the increased activation of ERK and the increased phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein and 4E-BP1. The increased phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein and 4E-BP1 in SIRI cardiac tissue suggested that mTOR was activated. To evaluate the requirement for mTOR in the development of cardiac hypertrophy in SIRI mice, mice were treated with rapamycin (sirolimus) or vehicle by daily intraperitoneal administration beginning 4 weeks after surgery. In previous work, rapamycin therapy blocked pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice. 18 Rapamycin was tolerated by SIRI mice and no mortality was observed. Renal function deteriorated with the administration of rapamycin, but animals did not become anorexic and body weight was maintained ( Table 1 ). Treated animals became more anemic but there was no evidence of cardiac dysfunction or dilatation. Indeed, trans-thoracic echocardiography showed that the LV ejection fraction was 65±1.9% in rapamycin-treated SIRI mice compared with 65±0.9% in vehicle-treated SIRI mice 8 weeks after surgery ( P =0.73; Table 3 ). However, echocardiographic evaluation of mice 8 weeks after surgery revealed that rapamycin treatment blocked the development of cardiac hypertrophy in SIRI mice ( Table 3 ). Indeed, the calculated LV mass index was 4.04±0.26 mg/g in vehicle-treated SIRI mice but was only 2.94±0.15 mg/g in rapamycin-treated SIRI mice ( P =0.012). Morphological evaluation of mice 8 weeks after surgery revealed that the biventricular weight-to-tibial length ratio was 6.8±0.21 mg/g in vehicle-treated SIRI mice but was decreased by 17.8% to 5.8±0.20 mg/g in rapamycin-treated animals ( P =0.001; Table 4 ). Similarly, the LV weight-to-tibial length ratio was 5.6±0.18 mg/g in vehicle-treated SIRI mice but was reduced to 4.6±0.2 mg/g in rapamycin-treated animals ( P =0.005). To determine whether rapamycin treatment affected cardiomyocyte size or cardiac fibrosis, we completed a histologic analysis of transverse ventricular tissue sections. Histologic evaluation of cardiomyocyte area showed that rapamycin treatment of SIRI mice resulted in an 87% decrease in cardiomyocyte area compared with vehicle treatment ( P =0.001; Figure 1 ). The deposition of extracellular matrix was evaluated by Masson’s trichrome staining of ventricular transverse sections. Cardiac fibrosis decreased by 53% in rapamycin-treated SIRI mice compared with vehicle treatment ( P <0.001; Figures 2 ). Analysis of ventricular cytosolic lysates revealed that phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein and 4E-BP1 was reduced in SIRI mice after rapamycin treatment when compared with vehicle treatment ( P <0.001, P =0.008, respectively; Figure 5 ). Cardiac ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation was unaffected by rapamycin treatment ( Figure 5 ).  RESULTS Surgically induced renal injury in mice To determine whether CKD in mice results in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, we studied the effect of surgically induced renal injury (SIRI) on 12-week-old 129/SvJ mice. In this method, the right kidney was injured by cauterization, and a left nephrectomy was performed after 2 weeks. The surgery was well tolerated by wild type 129/SvJ mice and no mortality was observed. The metabolic status of mice was determined both 4 and 8 weeks after the completion of SIRI or sham surgery ( Table 1 ). The serum creatinine was significantly increased in SIRI mice compared with sham animals at both 4- and 8-week time points. Four weeks after surgery, the serum creatinine was 0.71±0.006 in sham animals but was increased to 0.133±0.015 in SIRI mice ( P =0.003; Table 1 ). Eight weeks after surgery, the serum creatinine was 0.104±0.007 in sham mice but was increased 30.7% to 0.136±0.018 in SIRI mice ( P =0.016). Similarly, the BUN was significantly increased in SIRI mice at both the 4- and 8-week time points ( Table 1 ). Four weeks after surgery, the serum BUN was 16.0±4.1 mg/100 ml in sham mice but was increased to 54.0±4 mg/dl in SIRI animals ( P =0.00003). Eight weeks after surgery, the serum BUN was 22±1 mg/100 ml in sham mice but was increased to 83±3 mg/dl in SIRI animals ( P =0.0001).

Furthermore, diastolic function, measured as ? (Glantz), was similar in both SIRI and sham-operated mice 8 weeks after surgery. Systolic blood pressure, measured by determining the peak LV systolic pressure, was 139±11mmHg in sham-operated mice and was similar at 141±12mmHg in SIRI mice ( P =NS). Furthermore, SIRI mice were found to be normotensive by tail cuff blood pressure measurements and also by determination of carotid artery pressures with a Millar catheter ( Table 5 ).

However, the development of cardiac hypertrophy in SIRI mice was unaffected by hydralazine administration. Indeed, the LV weight-to-tibial length ratio was 5.8±0.15 mg/mm in hydralazine-treated SIRI mice, compared with 5.0±0.2 mg/mm in untreated sham-operated mice ( P =0.004; Table 6 ).  Development of cardiac hypertrophy after SIRI To evaluate the development of cardiac hypertrophy after SIRI, sequential transthoracic echocardiography was performed on unanesthetized mice 4 and 8 weeks after SIRI or sham surgery. LV systolic function, measured as fractional shortening, was nearly identical in SIRI and sham-operated mice at both time points ( Table 3 ). The echocardiographically determined LV mass index increased from 3.22±0.08 mg/g in sham-operated animals to 3.78±0.14 mg/g in SIRI animals 4 weeks after surgery was completed ( P =0.003). Similarly, at 8 weeks after surgery, the LV mass index increased from 3.20±0.15 mg/g in sham-operated animals to 3.96±0.11 mg/g in SIRI animals ( P =0.001). To confirm whether SIRI promoted cardiac hypertrophy, we weighed heart tissue of SIRI and control mice 8 weeks after surgery ( Table 4 ). The biventricular weight-to-tibial length ratio was increased from 6.3±0.1 mg/mm in sham-operated mice to 7.4±0.3 mg/mm in SIRI animals ( P =0.012). Furthermore, the LV weight-to-tibial length ratio increased from 5.0±0.18 mg/mm sham mice compared with 5.9±0.22 mg/mm in SIRI mice ( P =0.006; Table 4 ). To evaluate whether SIRI promoted the growth of individual cardiomyocytes and the deposition of extracellular matrix in cardiac tissue, we completed a histologic analysis of ventricular tissue sections. Cardiomyocyte area increased by 119% in SIRI mice when compared with sham-operated animals 8 weeks after surgery ( P =0.0001; Figure 1 ). Furthermore, cardiac fibrosis, evaluated in Masson’s trichrome-stained ventricular sections, increased by 120% in SIRI mice 8 weeks after surgery ( P =0.0001; Figure 2 ). To better evaluate cardiac systolic and diastolic function, we performed cardiac catheterization on anesthetized SIRI and control mice 8 weeks after surgery was completed. These studies demonstrated that LV systolic function, measured by determining +d P /d T max, was unchanged in SIRI mice (8844±667mmHg/s) when compared with sham-operated mice (8758±856mmHg/s) 8 weeks after surgery ( Table 5 ). Furthermore, diastolic function, measured as ? (Glantz), was similar in both SIRI and sham-operated mice 8 weeks after surgery. Systolic blood pressure, measured by determining the peak LV systolic pressure, was 139±11mmHg in sham-operated mice and was similar at 141±12mmHg in SIRI mice ( P =NS). Furthermore, SIRI mice were found to be normotensive by tail cuff blood pressure measurements and also by determination of carotid artery pressures with a Millar catheter ( Table 5 ). To determine whether a reduction in blood pressure would affect the development of cardiac hypertrophy after SIRI, mice were administered the arterial vasodilator hydralazine. Mice were administered hydralazine in their drinking water for 8 weeks after the completion of surgery to deliver a daily dose of 0.001 mg/g. Systolic blood pressure, determined by cardiac catheterization (LVPmax), was significantly lower in hydralazine-treated SIRI animals (101±11mmHg) when compared with untreated SIRI animals (141±12mmHg; P =0.037) or untreated sham-operated animals (139±11mmHg; P =0.032; Table 6 ). However, the development of cardiac hypertrophy in SIRI mice was unaffected by hydralazine administration. Indeed, the LV weight-to-tibial length ratio was 5.8±0.15 mg/mm in hydralazine-treated SIRI mice, compared with 5.0±0.2 mg/mm in untreated sham-operated mice ( P =0.004; Table 6 ).  Cardiac molecular adaptations in response to SIRI To evaluate whether the LVH observed in SIRI mice was associated with changes in cardiac gene expression, the expression of marker genes was evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 22 , 23 The concentration of mRNAs encoding atrial natriuretic factor and ?-myosin heavy chain in cardiac tissue correlate with the degree of pathological hypertrophy. 22 , 23 The concentration of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA was increased by 94% in LV tissue obtained from SIRI mice 2 weeks after surgery ( P =0.012; Figure 3 ). The LV concentration of ?-myosin heavy chain mRNA increased by 209% 2 weeks after surgery ( P =0.001). The mRNA levels of both genes returned to baseline 8 weeks after surgery ( Figure 3 ). To determine whether SIRI modulates the activation of intracellular signaling cascades in cardiac tissue, we obtained ventricular lysates 8 weeks after SIRI or sham surgery. Immunoblot analysis of ventricular lysates with phospho-specific antibodies was performed to evaluate the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2, ribosomal S6 protein, and 4E-BP1 ( Figure 4 ). The phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein and 4E-BP1 are markers of mTOR activation. 16 These experiments demonstrated that ERK1 and ERK2 activation was significantly increased in SIRI ventricular tissue 8 weeks after surgery ( P =0.011 for ERK1, P =0.007 for ERK2). Furthermore, S6 protein and a subfraction of 4E-BP1 (4E-BP1.2) phosphorylation were increased 8 weeks after surgery in SIRI mice ( P =0.002 for S6 protein, P =0.016 for 4E-BP1.2).  Cardiac molecular adaptations in response to SIRI To evaluate whether the LVH observed in SIRI mice was associated with changes in cardiac gene expression, the expression of marker genes was evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 22 , 23 The concentration of mRNAs encoding atrial natriuretic factor and ?-myosin heavy chain in cardiac tissue correlate with the degree of pathological hypertrophy. 22 , 23 The concentration of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA was increased by 94% in LV tissue obtained from SIRI mice 2 weeks after surgery ( P =0.012; Figure 3 ).

Rapamycin treatment of SIRI mice SIRI resulted in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and was associated with the increased activation of ERK and the increased phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein and 4E-BP1. The increased phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein and 4E-BP1 in SIRI cardiac tissue suggested that mTOR was activated. To evaluate the requirement for mTOR in the development of cardiac hypertrophy in SIRI mice, mice were treated with rapamycin (sirolimus) or vehicle by daily intraperitoneal administration beginning 4 weeks after surgery. In previous work, rapamycin therapy blocked pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice. 18 Rapamycin was tolerated by SIRI mice and no mortality was observed. Renal function deteriorated with the administration of rapamycin, but animals did not become anorexic and body weight was maintained ( Table 1 ). Treated animals became more anemic but there was no evidence of cardiac dysfunction or dilatation. Indeed, trans-thoracic echocardiography showed that the LV ejection fraction was 65±1.9% in rapamycin-treated SIRI mice compared with 65±0.9% in vehicle-treated SIRI mice 8 weeks after surgery ( P =0.73; Table 3 ). However, echocardiographic evaluation of mice 8 weeks after surgery revealed that rapamycin treatment blocked the development of cardiac hypertrophy in SIRI mice ( Table 3 ). Indeed, the calculated LV mass index was 4.04±0.26 mg/g in vehicle-treated SIRI mice but was only 2.94±0.15 mg/g in rapamycin-treated SIRI mice ( P =0.012). Morphological evaluation of mice 8 weeks after surgery revealed that the biventricular weight-to-tibial length ratio was 6.8±0.21 mg/g in vehicle-treated SIRI mice but was decreased by 17.8% to 5.8±0.20 mg/g in rapamycin-treated animals ( P =0.001; Table 4 ). Similarly, the LV weight-to-tibial length ratio was 5.6±0.18 mg/g in vehicle-treated SIRI mice but was reduced to 4.6±0.2 mg/g in rapamycin-treated animals ( P =0.005). To determine whether rapamycin treatment affected cardiomyocyte size or cardiac fibrosis, we completed a histologic analysis of transverse ventricular tissue sections. Histologic evaluation of cardiomyocyte area showed that rapamycin treatment of SIRI mice resulted in an 87% decrease in cardiomyocyte area compared with vehicle treatment ( P =0.001; Figure 1 ). The deposition of extracellular matrix was evaluated by Masson’s trichrome staining of ventricular transverse sections. Cardiac fibrosis decreased by 53% in rapamycin-treated SIRI mice compared with vehicle treatment ( P <0.001; Figures 2 ). Analysis of ventricular cytosolic lysates revealed that phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein and 4E-BP1 was reduced in SIRI mice after rapamycin treatment when compared with vehicle treatment ( P <0.001, P =0.008, respectively; Figure 5 ). Cardiac ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation was unaffected by rapamycin treatment ( Figure 5 ).  Rapamycin treatment of SIRI mice SIRI resulted in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and was associated with the increased activation of ERK and the increased phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein and 4E-BP1. The increased phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein and 4E-BP1 in SIRI cardiac tissue suggested that mTOR was activated. To evaluate the requirement for mTOR in the development of cardiac hypertrophy in SIRI mice, mice were treated with rapamycin (sirolimus) or vehicle by daily intraperitoneal administration beginning 4 weeks after surgery. In previous work, rapamycin therapy blocked pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice. 18 Rapamycin was tolerated by SIRI mice and no mortality was observed. Renal function deteriorated with the administration of rapamycin, but animals did not become anorexic and body weight was maintained ( Table 1 ). Treated animals became more anemic but there was no evidence of cardiac dysfunction or dilatation. Indeed, trans-thoracic echocardiography showed that the LV ejection fraction was 65±1.9% in rapamycin-treated SIRI mice compared with 65±0.9% in vehicle-treated SIRI mice 8 weeks after surgery ( P =0.73; Table 3 ). However, echocardiographic evaluation of mice 8 weeks after surgery revealed that rapamycin treatment blocked the development of cardiac hypertrophy in SIRI mice ( Table 3 ). Indeed, the calculated LV mass index was 4.04±0.26 mg/g in vehicle-treated SIRI mice but was only 2.94±0.15 mg/g in rapamycin-treated SIRI mice ( P =0.012).

Similarly, the LV weight-to-tibial length ratio was 5.6±0.18 mg/g in vehicle-treated SIRI mice but was reduced to 4.6±0.2 mg/g in rapamycin-treated animals ( P =0.005).

The deposition of extracellular matrix was evaluated by Masson’s trichrome staining of ventricular transverse sections. Cardiac fibrosis decreased by 53% in rapamycin-treated SIRI mice compared with vehicle treatment ( P <0.001; Figures 2 ). Analysis of ventricular cytosolic lysates revealed that phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein and 4E-BP1 was reduced in SIRI mice after rapamycin treatment when compared with vehicle treatment ( P <0.001, P =0.008, respectively; Figure 5 ). Cardiac ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation was unaffected by rapamycin treatment ( Figure 5 ).  DISCUSSION Cardiac hypertrophy develops in patients with CKD and contributes to the morbidity and mortality of this condition. 1 Although hypertension and volume overload may play a role in the development of uremic cardiomyopathy, more recent studies suggest that the accumulation of hypertrophic factors in serum, such as cardiotonic steroids, cytokines, growth factors, or hormones, may play a more central role. 1 Previous work with animal models of uremic cardiomyopathy mainly focused on experimentation with rats. However, the genetic manipulation of rats is much more difficult and expensive than it is in mice. To date, there is one recent study that describes a mouse model of uremic cardiomyopathy with associated significant induction of hypertension. 24 For this study, a hemodynamically controlled murine model of uremic cardiomyopathy was established. In the weeks following SIRI, mice developed uremia and a relatively mild reduction in glomerular filtration rate. Mice also developed a cardiomyopathy that consisted of cardiac hypertrophy, increased cardiomyocyte size, cardiac fibrosis, and altered cardiac tissue signaling pathway activation. Cardiac hypertrophy was detected by morphometry and transthoracic echocardiography. Altered cardiac signal transduction included increased activation of ERK1/2 protein kinase and increased ribosomal S6 protein and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of S6 protein and 4E-BP1 are signs of increased mTOR activity. Despite prominent changes in cardiac structure and intracellular signal transduction, SIRI mice had systolic blood pressure that was comparable to sham controls as measured by cardiac catheterization 8 weeks after surgery. In the murine model system described here, the left kidney was surgically removed, but a cautery technique was used to injure the right kidney so that blood flow was maintained in the remnant kidney. This technique leaves the renal artery and segmental arteries intact on the right side so that perturbation of the renin-angiotensin system is minimized. 25 Injury by arterial ligation is frequently used in rat renal injury model systems and may result in more profound hypertension than the technique that was employed in the current work. For example, Griffin et al. 26 demonstrated that renal mass reduction by cautery in rats did not alter blood pressure for 6 weeks after surgery. In the current work, mice subjected to SIRI did not develop systolic hypertension. Furthermore, mice treated with hydralazine developed significant cardiac hypertrophy despite a reduction in systolic blood pressure. Therefore, the cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis that occurs in SIRI mice appears to be independent of systolic hypertension. Although the development of cardiac hypertrophy in SIRI mice was not a consequence of pressure overload, the role of volume overload in this process must be considered. 1 Chronic renal disease is associated with volume overload, and body weight is one measure of intravascular volume status. SIRI mice had similar body weights to sham-operated animals at both 4 and 8 weeks after surgery. Of note is the fact that SIRI mice had high urine output both 4 and 8 weeks after surgery. To determine whether abnormalities in cardiac signaling in SIRI mice could help guide therapy for uremic cardiomyopathy, we treated animals with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Previous work from Shioi et al. 18 showed that daily intraperitoneal administration of rapamycin could block the development of cardiac hypertrophy in mice after aortic banding. Administration of rapamycin to SIRI mice from week 4 to week 8 after surgery blocked the development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Vehicle had a minor effect on normalized heart weight. Therefore, mTOR activity is required for the development of uremic cardiomyopathy in this murine model system. The relative role of ERK activation in the pathogenesis of this condition remains uncertain. Furthermore, the present results do not address the nature of the initiating factor(s) that culminate in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, and it is unclear whether cardiotonic steroids, cytokines, growth factors, or other ligands that accumulate in CKD are of primary importance. In conclusion, we established a murine model of normotensive uremic cardiomyopathy that developed in response to SIRI. Mice developed prominent cardiac hypertrophy with fibrosis that was associated with increased cardiac activation of the ERK and mTOR intracellular signal transduction pathways. Treatment of SIRI mice with rapamycin blocked the development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis when compared with vehicle-treated animals. As organ transplant recipients with CKD often take rapamycin as an immunomodulatory drug to suppress organ rejection, it may be possible to determine whether patients on this medication exhibit reversal of established cardiac hypertrophy.
