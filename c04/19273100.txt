Harnessing human CD1d restricted T cells for tumor immunity: progress and challenges Glycolipid reactive CD1d restricted natural killer T (NKT) cells represent a distinct population of T cells implicated in the regulation of immune responses in a broad range of diseases including cancer. Several studies have demonstrated the capacity of NKT cells bearing an invariant T cell receptor (iNKT cells) to recruit both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity and mediate tumor rejection in mice. Early phase clinical studies in humans have demonstrated the capacity of dendritic cells (DCs) to mediate expansion of NKT cells in vivo . However several challenges need to be overcome in order to effectively harness the properties of these cells in the clinic.
