Synergy Between PI3Kinase/AKT pathway and Bcl-xL in the Control of Apoptosis in Adenocarcinoma Cells of the Lung Adenocarcinomas of the lung commonly show an increase in the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, yet many are resistant to apoptosis induced by the inhibition of PI3K. We hypothesized that Bcl-xL would have a synergistic effect on the apoptotic response induced by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway in lung adenocarcinoma. To test this, we examined the effect of the PI3K inhibitor and LY294002 on lung adenocarcinoma cell lines expressing varying levels of Bcl-xL. We found that cells that overexpress Bcl-xL are resistant LY294002-induced apoptosis, while cells that express little Bcl-xL readily are not. Restoring Bcl-xL expression in cells that express low level of Bcl-xL conferred resistance to apoptosis in response to LY294002. The simultaneous inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002 or Akt1 siRNA and Bcl-xL function by ABT-737 or Bcl-xL siRNA greatly enhanced the apoptotic response. Moreover, this response was associated with the induction of proapoptotic BH3-only BCL2 family member Bim. Our data suggest that PI3K/Akt and Bcl-xL pathways control cell death in lung adenocarcinoma cells in a synergistic manner. Modulation of Bcl-xL expression may represent one important strategy to optimize the efficacy of therapeutic agents targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway in adenocarcinoma of the lung.  Introduction Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide with approximately 1.5 million cases each year ( 1 ). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancers, among which adenocarcinomas are the most common (40%). Adenocarcinomas of the lung have a high mortality rate, with a 5-year overall survival that is generally less than 15% ( 2 ). A major limitation to the curative potential of current therapy is resistance to chemotherapy ( 3 ). Anticancer drugs exert at least part of their cytotoxic effect by triggering apoptosis. Better understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling apoptosis is therefore crucial to defining new targets for therapeutic intervention in lung cancer. Molecular genetic studies have led to the discovery of several potential targets for therapeutic design, such as PI3K and Akt. The PI3K signal transduction pathway was found to regulate cell proliferation and survival and to be closely associated with the development and progression of various tumors ( 4 ). We and others have suggested that the PI3K signaling pathway is involved in the early stage of lung cancer progression; increases in gene copy number of the PI3K catalytic subunit and increases in Akt activity, as detected by phosphorylation status, have been observed in premalignant and malignant human bronchial epithelial cells and in NSCLC cells ( 5 – 7 ). Downstream from PI3K, phosphorylated Akt is a powerful promoter of cell survival as it antagonizes and inactivates various components of the apoptotic cascade such as proapoptotic Bad, caspase-9, and forkhead transcription factor family members ( 8 ). Various drugs targeted against molecular changes in these pathways have been developed and some are being tested for clinical use in lung cancer ( 9 , 10 ). The apoptotic response resulting from the inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathways have been observed to varying degrees in several types of cancer ( 11 – 14 ) including NSCLC cells ( 15 – 18 ). Therefore, it is important to identify mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to these agents. Proteins of the Bcl-2 family are key regulators of apoptosis. Overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL can provide tumor cells with resistance to a variety of cellular insults including chemotherapeutic drugs in cell culture and in animal models ( 19 , 20 ). There is evidence for a link between this survival mechanism and the PI3K pathway. The PI3K pathway targets members of the Bcl-2 family through phosphorylation and functional regulation ( 21 ). The PI3K pathway also regulates the expression of these proteins, as PI3K/Akt stimulates the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, such as Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, through the activation of NF-kB ( 22 ). However whether Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL contributes to the resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells to apoptosis induced by the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway is not established. The current study was therefore designed to investigate the synergistic effect PI3K/Akt pathway and Bcl-xL in controlling apoptosis in adenocarcinoma cells of the lung. We show that Bcl-xL plays a critical role in mediating resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells to cell death induced by the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Combined inhibition of Bcl-xL and PI3K/Akt pathway may represent a useful strategy for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma.

The PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 was purchased from Cell Signaling ( Beverly, MA, USA); Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT-737 or enantiomer of ABT-737 was obtained from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL, USA). The concentrations of these inhibitors used are as follows: LY294002 (25–50 ?M); ABT-737 or enantiomer of ABT-737 (1–8 ?M). In some experiments, the inhibitors were titrated to determine the lowest concentration that resulted in specific kinase inhibition and induction of apoptosis. The cells were plated 24h prior to adding the inhibitor in the presence of 10% serum for 24, 48, or 72 h and were then subjected to the analysis of Akt activation, cell apoptosis and cell cycle progression. All inhibitors were resuspended in DMSO as a vehicle. Apoptotic and cell cycle assays were repeated at least three times.

Results Lung adenocarcinoma cells are resistant to apoptosis induced by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt but undergo cell cycle arrest The apoptotic and cell cycle response to the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 were tested in a panel of five lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, A549, H549, H23, H1793 and H441 grown under normal growth conditions in the presence of 10% FBS. Akt activation was assessed by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies to phosphorylated Akt at S473. Apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V binding assay and sub-G1 population by PI nuclear staining. Treatment of these cells with 25 ?M LY294002 for 48 hours showed a negligible apoptotic response (<2%) in 4/5 cell lines tested ( Figure 1A ). Extending the treatment for up to 72 hours did not induce significant cell death in these cells ( Figure 1B ). In contrast, LY294002 induced apoptosis in more than 14–23 % in H23 cells ( Figure 1A and B ). While four out of five lung adenocarcinoma cell lines examined subjected to LY294002 failed to undergo apoptosis, this treatment was sufficient to inhibit cell growth and led to cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 in all five cell lines ( Figure 1A ). The ability of LY294002 to suppress the activation of Akt in these experiments was confirmed by western blotting with antibodies against phosphorylated Akt S473 as shown in Figure 1C . These data indicate that lung adenocarcninoma cells are commonly resistant to apoptosis induced by PI3K/Akt inhibition. Bcl-xL is highly expressed in most lung adenocarcinoma cell lines examined and its expression is independent of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway To explore the potential role of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL in the mechanism of the differential sensitivity to LY294002-induced apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells, we first evaluated the expression level of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in a subset of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Bcl-2 is barely detectable in all cell lines, which is consistent with the literature ( 25 ). This is not due to an inability of the antibody to detect Bcl-2 as the protein was readily detected in H69, a small cell lung cancer cell line included as a control ( Figure 2A ). In contrast, all cell lines, with the exception of H23, displayed high expression of Bcl-xL ( Figure 2A ). Interestingly, H23 is the cell line sensitive to LY294002-induced apoptosis ( Figure 1 ). Recent publications implicate the role of Akt activation in Bcl-xL expression levels in some type of cells ( 26 , 27 ). Therefore, we asked whether PI3K/Akt pathway activation regulates the expression of Bcl-xL in these lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Tumor cell lines were treated with 25 ?M LY294002, for up to 48 hours before analysis. As shown in Figures 2B and 2C Bcl-xL expression in A549 and H549 cells was independent of serum culture conditions ( Figure 2B ) or LY294002 treatment ( Figure 2C ) while phosphorylation of Akt was clearly modulated by these conditions. Combined inhibition of Bcl-xL and PI3K/Akt works in synergy to promote apoptosis of lung adenocarcinoma cells Based on the data presented in Figures 1 and 2 , we hypothesized that Bcl-xL expression may provide an important mechanism for resistance to apoptosis induced by PI3K/Akt inhibition in lung adenocarcinoma cells. To test this hypothesis, we developed two strategies to inhibit the function of Bcl-xL. First, we silenced Bcl-xL expression using siRNA technology, and second we tested a potent novel small molecule Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor, ABT-737 ( 28 ). After Bcl-xL function was inhibited, we determined the effect this had on the ability of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines to undergo apoptosis in response to LY294002 treatment or Akt1 gene silencing. In these experiments we used A549 and H549 cells, as these cells are resistant to LY294002-induced apoptosis and express a high level of Bcl-xL. Treatment of these cells with various concentrations of Bcl-xL siRNA demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in Bcl-xL protein level after 48 hours ( Figure 3A ). In contrast, scrambled siRNA had no significant effect on Bcl-xL expression. The addition of 25 ?M LY294002 dramatically increased apoptosis of A549 and H549 cells subjected to Bcl-xL siRNA treatment up to 26% and 23% respectively after 48 hours of treatment ( Figure 3B ). Similar results were obtained with ABT-737. A549 and H549 cells were treated with DMSO, LY294002, ABT-737, and ABT-737 enantiomer as control or combined compounds for 48h. As shown in Figure 3E , combined LY294002 and ABT-737 treatments increased cell apoptosis significantly as compared to the effect induced by LY294002 or ABT-737 alone (p<0.05). Thus, Bcl-xL inhibition renders lung adenocarcinoma cells sensitive to apoptosis induced by the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Because LY294002 specificity for PI3Kinase inhibition is not perfect, we tested the effect of Akt1 gene silencing on the apoptotic response observed in these cells with Bcl-xL inhibition. Immunoblot analysis of A549 and H549 cells lysates after transfection with a control siRNA or with Akt1 siRNA for 48 h demonstrated a clear reduction in both phosphorylated and total Akt protein levels ( Figure 3C ). Consistent with the effect of LY294002 alone observed on apoptosis ( Figure 3B ), Akt down regulation by siRNA alone is not enough to induce significant apoptosis in A549 or H549 cells. In contrast, the combination of Akt1 and Bcl-xL gene silencing led to apoptosis in 22–34% of the cells ( Figure 3D ). The apoptotic effect induced by combined treatment of Bcl-xL and Akt1 siRNA for 48 hours was also confirmed by the cleavage of PARP ( Figure 3B ). Taken together, these results support the conclusion that PI3K/Akt and Bcl-xL closely cooperate to the survival of lung adenocarcinoma. There is true synergy between the two molecular pathways as combined effect is favored over the sum of individual component effect on apoptosis ( Figure 3B, 3D and 3E ). Ectopic expression of Bcl-xL protects H23 cells from LY294002-induced apoptosis Because our results suggest a protective role for Bcl-xL in LY294002-induced apoptosis, we tested whether overexpression of Bcl-xL in H23 cells, which express a low level of Bcl-xL at baseline, may induce resistance to LY294002. To test this, we established H23 cell lines stably transfected with a Bcl-xL or control expression vector, and apoptosis was assessed following treatment with LY294002. Transfection with the Bcl-xL plasmid resulted in enhanced expression of Bcl-xL by more than 70% when compared to vector alone ( Figure 4A ). In H23 cells that had Bcl-xL expression restored, LY294002 induced cell death in less then 2% of cells, as compared to the 14% that was seen in the control cells after 48h treatment ( Figure 4B ). H23-Bcl-xL cells failed to undergo apoptosis even treated with high concentrations of LY294002 (50 and 75 ?M) ( Figure 4B and data not shown). These apoptosis rates are comparable to those of lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell lines resistant to LY294002-induced cell death ( Figure 1A ). This suggests that Bcl-xL is an important mediator of this resistance to apoptosis. Moreover, the overexpression of Bcl-xL increased the resistance of H23 cell to apoptotic effect induced by the combination of ABT-737 and LY294002. As shown in Figure 4C , combined 25 ?M LY294002 and 1 ?M ABT-737 is sufficient to induce apoptosis in 19% of H23, a response comparable to 18% induced by LY294002 at 50 ?M alone ( Figure 4B ). Similarly, ABT-737 has to be increased up to 8 ?M to induce comparable rate of apoptosis (15%) when combined with LY294002 in H23 cells transfected with Bcl-xL ( Figure 4C ). These results were confirmed by the cleaveage of PARP and Caspase 3 in H23 and H23-Bcl-xL cells treated combined ABT-737 and LY294002 in Figure 4D . Together, these results further demonstrate that Bcl-xL confers protection against PI3K inhibition-induced apoptosis in H23 cells. PI3K inhibition induced BIM expression in sensitive H23 cells To provide further insights as to how other Bcl-2 family members may be involved in the PI3K inhibition-induced apoptosis in H23 cells, the expression of pro-apoptosis and antiapoptosis-related Bcl-2 family members including Bad, Bax, Bim, Bid was tested in H23 and H23-pBabe-Bcl-xL cells. Figure 5A illustrates a significant induction of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein BIM isoform long (BimEL) and the shortest form ( BimS) in H23 cells treated with LY294002 for 48 h. In contrast, Bim was not activated in resistant H23-pBabe-Bcl-xL cells. There were no significant differences in the protein level of Bad, Bax or Bid. In resistant A549 and H549 cells, only combined high concentration of ABT-737 (> 4 ?M) and LY294002 (25 ?M) induced Bim activation as well as apoptosis indicated by cleaved PARP and Caspase 3 ( Figure 5B ).

The addition of 25 ?M LY294002 dramatically increased apoptosis of A549 and H549 cells subjected to Bcl-xL siRNA treatment up to 26% and 23% respectively after 48 hours of treatment ( Figure 3B ). Similar results were obtained with ABT-737. A549 and H549 cells were treated with DMSO, LY294002, ABT-737, and ABT-737 enantiomer as control or combined compounds for 48h. As shown in Figure 3E , combined LY294002 and ABT-737 treatments increased cell apoptosis significantly as compared to the effect induced by LY294002 or ABT-737 alone (p<0.05). Thus, Bcl-xL inhibition renders lung adenocarcinoma cells sensitive to apoptosis induced by the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Because LY294002 specificity for PI3Kinase inhibition is not perfect, we tested the effect of Akt1 gene silencing on the apoptotic response observed in these cells with Bcl-xL inhibition. Immunoblot analysis of A549 and H549 cells lysates after transfection with a control siRNA or with Akt1 siRNA for 48 h demonstrated a clear reduction in both phosphorylated and total Akt protein levels ( Figure 3C ). Consistent with the effect of LY294002 alone observed on apoptosis ( Figure 3B ), Akt down regulation by siRNA alone is not enough to induce significant apoptosis in A549 or H549 cells. In contrast, the combination of Akt1 and Bcl-xL gene silencing led to apoptosis in 22–34% of the cells ( Figure 3D ). The apoptotic effect induced by combined treatment of Bcl-xL and Akt1 siRNA for 48 hours was also confirmed by the cleavage of PARP ( Figure 3B ). Taken together, these results support the conclusion that PI3K/Akt and Bcl-xL closely cooperate to the survival of lung adenocarcinoma. There is true synergy between the two molecular pathways as combined effect is favored over the sum of individual component effect on apoptosis ( Figure 3B, 3D and 3E ). Ectopic expression of Bcl-xL protects H23 cells from LY294002-induced apoptosis Because our results suggest a protective role for Bcl-xL in LY294002-induced apoptosis, we tested whether overexpression of Bcl-xL in H23 cells, which express a low level of Bcl-xL at baseline, may induce resistance to LY294002. To test this, we established H23 cell lines stably transfected with a Bcl-xL or control expression vector, and apoptosis was assessed following treatment with LY294002. Transfection with the Bcl-xL plasmid resulted in enhanced expression of Bcl-xL by more than 70% when compared to vector alone ( Figure 4A ). In H23 cells that had Bcl-xL expression restored, LY294002 induced cell death in less then 2% of cells, as compared to the 14% that was seen in the control cells after 48h treatment ( Figure 4B ). H23-Bcl-xL cells failed to undergo apoptosis even treated with high concentrations of LY294002 (50 and 75 ?M) ( Figure 4B and data not shown). These apoptosis rates are comparable to those of lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell lines resistant to LY294002-induced cell death ( Figure 1A ). This suggests that Bcl-xL is an important mediator of this resistance to apoptosis. Moreover, the overexpression of Bcl-xL increased the resistance of H23 cell to apoptotic effect induced by the combination of ABT-737 and LY294002. As shown in Figure 4C , combined 25 ?M LY294002 and 1 ?M ABT-737 is sufficient to induce apoptosis in 19% of H23, a response comparable to 18% induced by LY294002 at 50 ?M alone ( Figure 4B ). Similarly, ABT-737 has to be increased up to 8 ?M to induce comparable rate of apoptosis (15%) when combined with LY294002 in H23 cells transfected with Bcl-xL ( Figure 4C ). These results were confirmed by the cleaveage of PARP and Caspase 3 in H23 and H23-Bcl-xL cells treated combined ABT-737 and LY294002 in Figure 4D . Together, these results further demonstrate that Bcl-xL confers protection against PI3K inhibition-induced apoptosis in H23 cells. PI3K inhibition induced BIM expression in sensitive H23 cells To provide further insights as to how other Bcl-2 family members may be involved in the PI3K inhibition-induced apoptosis in H23 cells, the expression of pro-apoptosis and antiapoptosis-related Bcl-2 family members including Bad, Bax, Bim, Bid was tested in H23 and H23-pBabe-Bcl-xL cells. Figure 5A illustrates a significant induction of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein BIM isoform long (BimEL) and the shortest form ( BimS) in H23 cells treated with LY294002 for 48 h. In contrast, Bim was not activated in resistant H23-pBabe-Bcl-xL cells. There were no significant differences in the protein level of Bad, Bax or Bid. In resistant A549 and H549 cells, only combined high concentration of ABT-737 (> 4 ?M) and LY294002 (25 ?M) induced Bim activation as well as apoptosis indicated by cleaved PARP and Caspase 3 ( Figure 5B ).  Lung adenocarcinoma cells are resistant to apoptosis induced by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt but undergo cell cycle arrest The apoptotic and cell cycle response to the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 were tested in a panel of five lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, A549, H549, H23, H1793 and H441 grown under normal growth conditions in the presence of 10% FBS. Akt activation was assessed by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies to phosphorylated Akt at S473. Apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V binding assay and sub-G1 population by PI nuclear staining. Treatment of these cells with 25 ?M LY294002 for 48 hours showed a negligible apoptotic response (<2%) in 4/5 cell lines tested ( Figure 1A ). Extending the treatment for up to 72 hours did not induce significant cell death in these cells ( Figure 1B ). In contrast, LY294002 induced apoptosis in more than 14–23 % in H23 cells ( Figure 1A and B ). While four out of five lung adenocarcinoma cell lines examined subjected to LY294002 failed to undergo apoptosis, this treatment was sufficient to inhibit cell growth and led to cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 in all five cell lines ( Figure 1A ). The ability of LY294002 to suppress the activation of Akt in these experiments was confirmed by western blotting with antibodies against phosphorylated Akt S473 as shown in Figure 1C . These data indicate that lung adenocarcninoma cells are commonly resistant to apoptosis induced by PI3K/Akt inhibition.  Lung adenocarcinoma cells are resistant to apoptosis induced by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt but undergo cell cycle arrest The apoptotic and cell cycle response to the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 were tested in a panel of five lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, A549, H549, H23, H1793 and H441 grown under normal growth conditions in the presence of 10% FBS.

These data indicate that lung adenocarcninoma cells are commonly resistant to apoptosis induced by PI3K/Akt inhibition.  Bcl-xL is highly expressed in most lung adenocarcinoma cell lines examined and its expression is independent of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway To explore the potential role of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL in the mechanism of the differential sensitivity to LY294002-induced apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells, we first evaluated the expression level of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in a subset of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Bcl-2 is barely detectable in all cell lines, which is consistent with the literature ( 25 ). This is not due to an inability of the antibody to detect Bcl-2 as the protein was readily detected in H69, a small cell lung cancer cell line included as a control ( Figure 2A ). In contrast, all cell lines, with the exception of H23, displayed high expression of Bcl-xL ( Figure 2A ). Interestingly, H23 is the cell line sensitive to LY294002-induced apoptosis ( Figure 1 ). Recent publications implicate the role of Akt activation in Bcl-xL expression levels in some type of cells ( 26 , 27 ). Therefore, we asked whether PI3K/Akt pathway activation regulates the expression of Bcl-xL in these lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Tumor cell lines were treated with 25 ?M LY294002, for up to 48 hours before analysis. As shown in Figures 2B and 2C Bcl-xL expression in A549 and H549 cells was independent of serum culture conditions ( Figure 2B ) or LY294002 treatment ( Figure 2C ) while phosphorylation of Akt was clearly modulated by these conditions.

Combined inhibition of Bcl-xL and PI3K/Akt works in synergy to promote apoptosis of lung adenocarcinoma cells Based on the data presented in Figures 1 and 2 , we hypothesized that Bcl-xL expression may provide an important mechanism for resistance to apoptosis induced by PI3K/Akt inhibition in lung adenocarcinoma cells. To test this hypothesis, we developed two strategies to inhibit the function of Bcl-xL. First, we silenced Bcl-xL expression using siRNA technology, and second we tested a potent novel small molecule Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor, ABT-737 ( 28 ). After Bcl-xL function was inhibited, we determined the effect this had on the ability of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines to undergo apoptosis in response to LY294002 treatment or Akt1 gene silencing. In these experiments we used A549 and H549 cells, as these cells are resistant to LY294002-induced apoptosis and express a high level of Bcl-xL. Treatment of these cells with various concentrations of Bcl-xL siRNA demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in Bcl-xL protein level after 48 hours ( Figure 3A ). In contrast, scrambled siRNA had no significant effect on Bcl-xL expression. The addition of 25 ?M LY294002 dramatically increased apoptosis of A549 and H549 cells subjected to Bcl-xL siRNA treatment up to 26% and 23% respectively after 48 hours of treatment ( Figure 3B ). Similar results were obtained with ABT-737. A549 and H549 cells were treated with DMSO, LY294002, ABT-737, and ABT-737 enantiomer as control or combined compounds for 48h. As shown in Figure 3E , combined LY294002 and ABT-737 treatments increased cell apoptosis significantly as compared to the effect induced by LY294002 or ABT-737 alone (p<0.05). Thus, Bcl-xL inhibition renders lung adenocarcinoma cells sensitive to apoptosis induced by the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Because LY294002 specificity for PI3Kinase inhibition is not perfect, we tested the effect of Akt1 gene silencing on the apoptotic response observed in these cells with Bcl-xL inhibition.

PI3K inhibition induced BIM expression in sensitive H23 cells To provide further insights as to how other Bcl-2 family members may be involved in the PI3K inhibition-induced apoptosis in H23 cells, the expression of pro-apoptosis and antiapoptosis-related Bcl-2 family members including Bad, Bax, Bim, Bid was tested in H23 and H23-pBabe-Bcl-xL cells. Figure 5A illustrates a significant induction of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein BIM isoform long (BimEL) and the shortest form ( BimS) in H23 cells treated with LY294002 for 48 h. In contrast, Bim was not activated in resistant H23-pBabe-Bcl-xL cells. There were no significant differences in the protein level of Bad, Bax or Bid. In resistant A549 and H549 cells, only combined high concentration of ABT-737 (> 4 ?M) and LY294002 (25 ?M) induced Bim activation as well as apoptosis indicated by cleaved PARP and Caspase 3 ( Figure 5B ).  PI3K inhibition induced BIM expression in sensitive H23 cells To provide further insights as to how other Bcl-2 family members may be involved in the PI3K inhibition-induced apoptosis in H23 cells, the expression of pro-apoptosis and antiapoptosis-related Bcl-2 family members including Bad, Bax, Bim, Bid was tested in H23 and H23-pBabe-Bcl-xL cells.

Discussion Regulation of cell survival pathways is pivotal in not only cancer progression, but has also become increasingly important in understanding mechanisms that underlie resistance to therapy. Our study defined one potential mechanism by which lung adenocarcinoma cell lines could be resistant to apoptosis induced by the inhibition of such survival pathways. One pathway of particular clinical interest is the PI3K/Akt pathway. This pathway is disrupted in many cancer types, and resistance to inhibitors of PI3K has been reported in cancers, including lung cancer. Therefore, it is important understand the mechanisms by which these tumors develop resistance to these drugs to improve the therapeutic efficacy. Our results implicate another important survival protein, Bcl-xL, as one potential mechanism for resistance. First, our data demonstrate that by inhibiting the expression of Bcl-xL, the apoptotic response is restored in lung adenocarcinoma cells otherwise resistant to the cell death induced by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Furthermore, Bcl-xL and PI3K inhibition in combination had a synergistic effect on apoptosis. In a set of converse experiments, where Bcl-xL expression was restored in cells that lack Bcl-xL, cells did not undergo apoptosis in response to PI3K inhibition. These data taken together suggest that a combination therapy that inhibits two critical survival pathways may have a role in the treatment of adenocarcinomas of the lung and that Bcl-xL expression may be a predictor of a tumor’s resistance to chemotherapy involving inhibition of PI3K. Molecular studies have led to the discovery of several potential targets for cancer therapeutic design, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MEK and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL ( 9 , 28 ). Various drugs targeted against these molecular changes have been developed and some are being tested for clinical use in lung cancer therapy ( 9 , 10 ). However, recent work suggests that mammalian cells have developed several different survival pathways that become activated in a cell type- and stimulus-dependent fashion, leaving the prospect of inhibiting these pathways alone may not be sufficient to induce cell death ( 29 , 30 ). The inherited or acquired resistance to small molecular inhibitors such as PI3K/Akt inhibitor (LY294002 or wortmannin) ( 15 , 16 , 18 ), mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin) ( 17 ), EGFR inhibitor (gefitinib) and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL (ABT-737) inhibitor ( 28 ) is indeed observed frequently in various types of cancers including NSCLC. Our study shows that to overcome the cellular mechanisms of drug resistance to PI3K inhibition in adenocarcinoma of the lung, Bcl-xL expression needs to be down-regulated, and that process is associated with induction of proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bim. Proteins in the Bcl-2 family are central regulators of programmed cell death and contribute to chemotherapy resistance of cancer cells via growth factor-dependent or -independent mechanism. For example, high levels of the anti-apoptotic MCL-1 protein is the major factor that causes resistance to ABT-737 in small cell lung cancer and acute myeloid leukemia ( 31 , 32 ). Pro-apoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family member Bim is essential for TKI-induced apoptosis in sensitive EGFR-mutant cells of lung cancer ( 33 – 35 ). Our results implicate Bcl-xL as another important survival protein in causing resistance to the PI3K inhibition in NSCLC cell lines that do not harbor EGFR mutations. Moreover, we show that Bim appears to be implicated in the apoptotic response to PI3K inhibition in lung adenocarcinoma cells expressing low levels of Bcl-xL though the exact mechanism by which Bcl-xL downregulation may promote Bim activation after PI3K inhibition remains to be determined. Our data warrant further investigation of the role of Bim induction in the apoptosis induced by LY294002 in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Functional cooperation between PI3K/Akt and Bcl-2 family member proteins has emerged as an important mechanisms for preventing cells from apoptosis and promoting tumorigenesis ( 36 – 38 ). While Bcl-xL has been implicated in cell survival independent of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the prostate cancer cells ( 39 ), the data we report here suggests a cross talk between the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic cell survival machinery. Although our data indicate that Bcl-xL expression is independent of PI3K/Akt or mTOR pathway activation, we clearly demonstrate that Bcl-xL plays a role in the apoptotic response of lung cancer cell lines to LY294002. In fact, we report a synergistic effect when combining Bcl-xL inhibition, with PI3K inhibition, suggesting a coordination of function between these two pathways ( Figure 3 ). In addition to the cooperation between Akt and Bcl-2 pathway, interactions between the PI3K/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways are also important for the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis in several types of cancers including small cell lung cancer cells ( 40 , 41 ). However, these interactions remain controversial. Future studies into these types of biomolecular interactions are therefore warranted. In summary, we have shown that the resistance of adenocarcinoma of the lung to PI3K inhibitor-induced apoptosis can be overcome by downregulation of Bcl-xL. PI3K/Akt pathway and Bcl-xL expression cooperate to promote cell survival and the level of Bcl-xL expression is a key mechanism controlling the resistance to cell death induced by PI3K/Akt inhibition. These results may have important implications and suggest that an approach directed to both molecular targets PIK3K/AKT and Bcl-xL may offer greater therapeutic response to adenocarcinoma of the lung.  Discussion Regulation of cell survival pathways is pivotal in not only cancer progression, but has also become increasingly important in understanding mechanisms that underlie resistance to therapy. Our study defined one potential mechanism by which lung adenocarcinoma cell lines could be resistant to apoptosis induced by the inhibition of such survival pathways.

The inherited or acquired resistance to small molecular inhibitors such as PI3K/Akt inhibitor (LY294002 or wortmannin) ( 15 , 16 , 18 ), mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin) ( 17 ), EGFR inhibitor (gefitinib) and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL (ABT-737) inhibitor ( 28 ) is indeed observed frequently in various types of cancers including NSCLC. Our study shows that to overcome the cellular mechanisms of drug resistance to PI3K inhibition in adenocarcinoma of the lung, Bcl-xL expression needs to be down-regulated, and that process is associated with induction of proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bim. Proteins in the Bcl-2 family are central regulators of programmed cell death and contribute to chemotherapy resistance of cancer cells via growth factor-dependent or -independent mechanism. For example, high levels of the anti-apoptotic MCL-1 protein is the major factor that causes resistance to ABT-737 in small cell lung cancer and acute myeloid leukemia ( 31 , 32 ). Pro-apoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family member Bim is essential for TKI-induced apoptosis in sensitive EGFR-mutant cells of lung cancer ( 33 – 35 ). Our results implicate Bcl-xL as another important survival protein in causing resistance to the PI3K inhibition in NSCLC cell lines that do not harbor EGFR mutations. Moreover, we show that Bim appears to be implicated in the apoptotic response to PI3K inhibition in lung adenocarcinoma cells expressing low levels of Bcl-xL though the exact mechanism by which Bcl-xL downregulation may promote Bim activation after PI3K inhibition remains to be determined. Our data warrant further investigation of the role of Bim induction in the apoptosis induced by LY294002 in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Functional cooperation between PI3K/Akt and Bcl-2 family member proteins has emerged as an important mechanisms for preventing cells from apoptosis and promoting tumorigenesis ( 36 – 38 ). While Bcl-xL has been implicated in cell survival independent of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the prostate cancer cells ( 39 ), the data we report here suggests a cross talk between the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic cell survival machinery. Although our data indicate that Bcl-xL expression is independent of PI3K/Akt or mTOR pathway activation, we clearly demonstrate that Bcl-xL plays a role in the apoptotic response of lung cancer cell lines to LY294002. In fact, we report a synergistic effect when combining Bcl-xL inhibition, with PI3K inhibition, suggesting a coordination of function between these two pathways ( Figure 3 ). In addition to the cooperation between Akt and Bcl-2 pathway, interactions between the PI3K/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways are also important for the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis in several types of cancers including small cell lung cancer cells ( 40 , 41 ). However, these interactions remain controversial. Future studies into these types of biomolecular interactions are therefore warranted. In summary, we have shown that the resistance of adenocarcinoma of the lung to PI3K inhibitor-induced apoptosis can be overcome by downregulation of Bcl-xL. PI3K/Akt pathway and Bcl-xL expression cooperate to promote cell survival and the level of Bcl-xL expression is a key mechanism controlling the resistance to cell death induced by PI3K/Akt inhibition. These results may have important implications and suggest that an approach directed to both molecular targets PIK3K/AKT and Bcl-xL may offer greater therapeutic response to adenocarcinoma of the lung.
