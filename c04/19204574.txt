MYC and EIF3H Coamplification Significantly Improve Response and Survival of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients (NSCLC) Treated with Gefitinib Background We investigated the incidence of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit H ( EIF3H ) and MYC amplification in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, and whether MYC/EIF3H increased gene copy number affected response to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Methods Metastatic NSCLC patients ( n = 54) treated with gefitinib were analyzed for the genomic content of EIF3H and MYC genes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a custom-designed 3-color DNA probe set. Result Amplification of EIF3H (ratio EIF3H /CEP8 >2), was observed in 10 cases (18.5%), and MYC was coamplified in all. MYC amplification without coamplification of EIF3H was observed in 2 cases (3.7%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to identify the cutoff for MYC and EIF3H copy number best discriminating sensitive and resistant populations. MYC FISH positive patients ( MYC +, mean ?2.8) had a significantly higher response rate ( p = 0.003), longer time to progression ( p = 0.01) and overall survival (OS: p = 0.02) than MYC ? (mean <2.8). Similarly, EIF3H FISH positive patients ( EIF3H +, mean ?2.75) had a significantly higher response rate ( p = 0.002), longer time to progression ( p = 0.01) and OS ( p = 0.01) than EIF3H ? (mean <2.75). Conclusion Our results indicate that MYC and EIF3H are frequently coamplified in NSCLC and that a high copy number correlates with increased epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors sensitivity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patient Selection The present retrospective study was conducted in a cohort of NSCLC patients previously evaluated for EGFR and HER2 gene copy number. 4 , 25 Among the 102 patients included in the original study, 54 had tumor tissue available and were selected for the present analysis. No additional clinical or biologic characteristic was used for patient selection. All patients had histologically confirmed NSCLC with measurable, locally advanced or metastatic disease, progressing or relapsing after chemotherapy, or with medical contraindications for chemotherapy. Patients were classified as never smokers (<100 cigarettes per lifetime), former smokers (quit smoking more than 6 months before starting gefitinib therapy), or current smokers (quit smoking less than 6 months before starting gefitinib therapy or active smokers). Patients received gefitinib (250 mg/d) and were evaluated for response after 2 months according to the RECIST criteria. 26 Tumor response was assessed by computer tomography scan, with a confirmatory evaluation repeated in patients with complete response (CR), partial response, and stable disease at least 4 weeks after the initial determination of response. The study population included 14 (26.4%) patients positive for EGFR by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Eleven patients (22.4%) had an EGFR mutation in exon 19 or 21 and 10 patients (21.7%) had a KRAS mutation. All patients received at least one previous chemotherapy, including platinum in 80.4% of cases. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee and was conducted in accordance with ethical principles stated in the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki. Tissue Preparation and FISH Analyses Sections from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks containing representative malignant cells obtained at time of diagnosis were used for this analysis. Histopathological classification was determined on hematoxylin-eosin stained sections based on the World Health Organization criteria. 27 DNA insert of the BAC clone NO 764P21, encompassing sequences of the EIF3H gene, was amplified and labeled by nick-translation using a Nick Translation Kit (Vysis/Abbott Molecular Catalog#32-801300) and SpectrumGreen conjugated dUTPs according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The labeled DNA was precipitated in the presence of human Cot1 DNA. The chromosomal mapping and the hybridization efficiency of the new reagent was tested in specimens with normal karyotypes. Three-color FISH assays were performed on blank 4 µm, paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue sections, using the SpectrumGreen labeled EIF3H probe, the LSI C- MYC SpectrumOrange and the CEP-8 SpectrumAqua commercial probes (Abbott Molecular) according to standard protocol in the laboratory. Initially the slides were incubated for 2 hours at 65°C, deparaffinized in Citri-Solv (Fisher) and washed in 100% ethanol for 5 minutes. The slides were sequentially incubated in 2× SSC at 75°C for 10 to 18 minutes, digested in 0.25 mg/ml Proteinase K/2× SSC at 45°C for 10 to 18 minutes, washed in 2× SSC for 5 minutes, and dehydrated in ethanol. The probe mixture was prepared using 0.5 µl of the stock reagent of each of the commercial probes and 200 ng of DNA from the EIF3H probe and applied to the selected hybridization areas, which were covered with glass coverslips and sealed with rubber cement. DNA denaturation was performed for 15 minutes at 80°C and slides were incubated at 37°C for 24 to 48 hours. Posthybridization washes were performed with 2× SSC/0.3% NP-40 at 72°C for 2 minutes. The slides were then washed in 2× SSC for 1 minute, dehydrated in ethanol and chromatin was counterstained with diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.3 µg/ml in Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Analysis was performed on epifluorescence microscope using single interference filter sets for green (fluorescein isothiocyanate), red (Texas red), aqua (Aqua) and blue (diamidino-2-phenylindole) as well as dual (red/green) and triple (blue, red, green) band pass filters. For documentation, images were captured using a charge- coupled device camera and merged using dedicated software. Statistical Analysis The primary end-point of the study was the association of MYC and EIF3H gene copy number with response to gefitinib therapy. Analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was carried out with the aim of determining a cutoff point for MYC and EIF3H gene copy numbers as a continuous variable. 28 Sensitivity and specificity were expressed in terms of percentage and the highest value has been chosen as the best cutoff point. Secondary end-points were association with time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). TTP was calculated from the time of first gefitinib dose administration to time of disease progression or last disease assessment. OS was calculated from the time of first gefitinib dose administration to patient death or last contact. Differences in response rate (RR) were compared by Fisher’s exact test or ?2 test. TTP, OS, and the 95% confidence intervals were evaluated by survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier method. 29 TTP and OS for the groups with negative and positive biomarker were compared using the log-rank test. Statistical significance was set at <0.05 for each analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 11.5.1 (SPSS Italia srl, Bologna, Italy).

RESULTS Patient Characteristics Characteristics of the 54 patients included in the study are shown in Table 1 . The median age was 61 years (range 25–79), the majority of patients were male (64.8%), and most were former or current smokers (85.2%) with a good performance status (ECOG PS 0–1: 90.7%). Adenocarcinoma was the most frequent histologic type (55.6%). In the study population, the overall response rate was 17.0%, including 1 CR and 8 partial responses (PR). The disease control rate, including CR, PR, and stable disease, was 41.5%, median TTP was 3.5 months, and median survival was 11.0 months. EGFR FISH and mutation status was known in 53 and 49 patients, respectively. EGFR was positive by FISH in 14 (26%) cases and by mutation in 11 (22%). Response rate was significantly higher in EGFR FISH positive than in negative (50% versus 5%, p = 0.001) and in patients with EGFR mutations than in EGFR wild type (63% versus 2%, p = 0.0001). Outcome According to <italic>MYC</italic> Gene Copy Number As shown in Table 2 , FISH analysis for MYC was successfully performed in all patients. Median mean MYC gene copy number was 2.92 copies/cell (range 1.52–12.38). Amplification of MYC (ratio MYC /CEP8 >2), was observed in 12 cases (22.2%). In the ROC analysis, a cut-off of MYC copy number per cell at 2.8 identified an area under the curve of 0.78 ( Figure 1 A ). Using this cutoff, 25 specimens (46.3%) were MYC FISH negative (mean per cell <2.78) and 29 (53.7%) were MYC FISH positive (mean per cell ?2.8 copies). Among the 29 MYC FISH positive patients, 7 were EGFR FISH positive and EGFR mutated, 4 were EGFR FISH positive, 1 harbored an EGFR mutation and 5 harbored a KRAS mutation. Increased MYC gene copy number was not associated with any statistically significant clinical or biologic characteristic, even though the MYC FISH positive patients were more frequently EGFR FISH positive, EGFR mutated and never smokers. The RR significantly favored MYC FISH positive over MYC FISH negative patients (31.0% versus 0%, p = 0.003), as well as TTP (4.4 versus 2.6 months, p = 0.014) and OS (13.8 versus 6.4 months, p = 0.025), as shown in Table 2 and Figure 2 . In the small subgroup of EGFR FISH positive or EGFR mutated patients ( n = 17), all responders were MYC FISH positive (66.0% in EGFR positive/ MYC positive versus 0% in EGFR positive/ MYC negative, p = 0.04). Outcome According to <italic>EIF3H</italic> Gene Copy Number EIF3H was successfully evaluated by FISH in all cases ( Table 2 ). Median mean EIF3H gene copy number was 2.79 copies/cell (range 1.65–5.02). Amplification of EIF3H (ratio EIF3H /CEP8 >2), was observed in 10 cases (18.5%), and MYC was coamplified in all ( Figure 3 ). There were only two cases with MYC amplification in which EIF3H was not coamplified. Using a ROC analysis ( Figure 1 B ), a cutoff of EIF3H copy number per cell at 2.75 identified an area under the curve of 0.84. Using this cutoff, 28 specimens (51.8%) were EIF3H FISH positive (mean per cell ?2.75 copies) and 26 (48.2%) were EIF3H FISH negative (mean per cell <2.75). As was the case for MYC , increased EIF3H gene copy number was not associated any statistically significant clinical or biologic characteristic. Nevertheless, EIF3H FISH positive cases were more frequently never smokers and EGFR positive either by FISH or mutated. Interestingly, all EIF3H FISH positive patients were also MYC FISH positive, and this association was statistically significant ( p < 0.0001). EIF3H FISH positive patients had a significantly higher RR (32.1% versus 0%, p = 0.002), significantly longer TTP (4.4 versus 2.7 months, p = 0.01) and OS (17.8 versus 6.4 months, p = 0.01) than EIF3H FISH negative, as shown in Table 2 and Figure 4 . In the small cohort of patients that were EGFR FISH positive or harbored an EGFR mutation ( n = 17), all responders were EIF3H FISH positive and vice versa ( p = 0.01).

DISCUSSION The present study, conducted in a NSCLC population exposed to the EGFR-TKI gefitinib, for the first time demonstrated that MYC and EIF3H are frequently coamplified in NSCLC and this event could affect drug sensitivity. Patients with MYC or EIF3H increased gene copy number had better outcomes in terms of response, TTP and survival than individuals lacking MYC/EIF3H gene gain. Previous studies have reported that amplification of 8q may be involved in cancer progression. 10 The two genes evaluated in our study, MYC and EIF3H , have been suggested to be putative target genes in 8q23-q24. 22 , 30 , 31 These two genes are frequently coamplified in recurrent hormone-refractory prostate cancer 21 and in breast cancer, but they were not always included in the same amplicon. 19 , 32 Nevertheless, Nupponen et al., 32 based on the amplicon mapping and gene expression data, reported that the strongest candidate target gene for the 8q23-q24 amplification was EIF3H . In the present study, for the first time we have shown that EIF3H and MYC are frequently coamplified in NSCLC and probably these two genes are not included in the same amplicon. Interestingly, many of the genes regulated by MYC affect ribosome biogenesis and protein translation. 33 – 35 Thus, coamplification of EIF3H and MYC may cooperate in enhanced protein translation, either in a general way or for a specific subset of mRNAs. To perform this study, we developed a three-color DNA probe set to simultaneously examine the copy number of EIF3H, MYC and centromere eight sequences in lung tumors, and were able to observe amplification of both EIF3H and MYC in the same tumor cells. This finding generates the hypothesis that coamplification and overexpression of EIF3H with MYC cooperatively shifts the repertoire of actively translated mRNAs to a set of genes that drive proliferation and growth, or inhibit apoptosis. The possibility that MYC influences the efficacy of agents targeting the EGFR family has been postulated in a study conducted in breast cancer patients. 16 , 17 In the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel B-31 clinical trial, which compared treatment with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, a total of 1549 patients were evaluated for MYC , and 30% of patients displayed gene amplification. Among patients with amplification of both HER2 and MYC , the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy reduced the risk of cancer recurrence by 76% and reduced the risk of death by 64%, while in individuals with HER2 amplification alone the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy did not reduce the risk of death. 16 In our study, we observed that both MYC and EIF3H were associated with a better outcome after gefitinib therapy, and among EGFR+ patients (FISH+ and/or mutated), only individuals with increased MYC/EIF3H gene copy number had a significant tumor shrinkage. The mechanism responsible for the highest sensitivity to anti-EGFR agents in presence of MYC/EIF3H gene gain is not clear. The small number of patients included in the present study and the strong association between the clinical and biologic parameters did not allow us to assess the value of different predictors in a multivariable model. Nevertheless, preclinical data have demonstrated that drugs interfering with the EGFR family inhibit expression and activity of MYC , suggesting that MYC -dependent tumors may be more sensitive to anti-EGFR strategies. 36 – 38 MYC expression is known to induce apoptosis, which can be inhibited by signaling from either the RAS and AKT pathways, 39 antiapoptotic molecules, i.e., BCL-2, 40 or through the up-regulation of factors such as MAD-1, which directly antagonize MYC function. 41 Coamplification of EIF3H may also reduce MYC -dependent apoptosis in prostate epithelial cells. 42 If MYC up-regulation was an early event in some tumors, then growth factor signaling of EIF3H over-expression might provide a necessary antiapoptotic signal. Finally, it is not possible to exclude that other genes included in the amplicon could in some way modulate drug sensitivity. MYC gene amplification has been evaluated in several solid tumors, including lung cancer. 13 , 14 , 43 Conversely, to our knowledge, no previous study investigated the incidence of EIF3H gene amplification in lung tumors. Previous studies reported a 13 to 23% incidence of MYC amplification in small cell lung cancer and 5 to 12% in NSCLC. 12 In the study conducted by Kubokura et al., 12 the incidence of MYC amplification in NSCLC was up to 88%, higher than reported in other experiences including the present study probably because of the different and less stringent criteria used for defining gene amplification. Interestingly, Kubokura study showed that MYC amplification correlated with lymph node metastasis, suggesting a possible negative effect on survival. Although the absence of a control arm precludes the possibility to discriminate between the predictive versus prognostic effect of study genes, our results, together with the possible negative prognostic effect of both EIF3H and MYC 12 , 13 , 21 , 22 suggest that those genes could represent a favorable predictive factor for survival in patients exposed to EGFR-TKIs. In conclusion, our results showed for the first time that MYC and EIF3H are coamplified in NSCLC and this biologic event could positively affect the response and survival of patients treated with EGFR-TKIs. These data originated from a retrospective analysis and a prospective validation is warranted.
