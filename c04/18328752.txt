Quantitative somatic sensory testing and functional imaging of the response to painful stimuli before and after cingulotomy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) The middle cingulate cortex (MCC) has been implicated in pain processing by studies of cingulotomy for chronic pain and imaging studies documenting increased MCC blood flow in response to acute pain. The only previous report of quantitative sensory testing following cingulotomy described increased intensity and unpleasantness ratings of painful hot and cold stimuli in a single patient with psychiatric disease. We now report a case in which perception of pain and temperature was assessed before and after cingulotomy for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Positron emission tomographic (PET) studies of the bloodflow response to acute pain were carried out using a single subject design which allowed for statistical evaluation of postoperative blood flow changes in this case. Postoperatively, the patient demonstrated increased intensity and unpleasantness ratings of painful thermal waterbath stimuli. The PET studies demonstrated preoperative contact heat pain-evoked activation of the bilateral MCC/SMA (supplementary motor area) and the left (contralateral) fronto-parietal operculum. Postoperative pain-evoked activation was demonstrated in the right (ipsilateral) parasylvian cortex but not of the MCC/SMA. Prior studies of forebrain lesions, and of cortical synchrony during the application of painful stimuli suggest the presence of functional connectivity between components of the MCC/SMA and the fronto-parietal opercula. Therefore present results suggest that cingulate lesions disinhibit ipsilateral parasylvian cortex and so are independent evidence of functional connectivity between these cortical areas, the defining characteristic of components in a pain network.  RESULTS Lesion Location Figure 1 shows that the lesions (black arrowheads on right side of postoperative images) involved a cylinder of cingulate bundle and cortex (radius 6mm) which was centered 33 mm dorsal to the AC-PC line and 22 mm rostral to the AC [ Talairach and Tournoux 1988 ]. The left and right lesions were centered 12 and 16 mm lateral to the midline, as determined by the MRI location of the cingulum bundle on either side. The location shown in this Figure corresponds to the lesion locations demonstrated in many previous reports of cingulotomy (reviewed by [ Abdelaziz and Cosgrove 2002 ]). Psychophysical results The preoperative psychophysical test session revealed thresholds within the normal range, and with no indication of a laterality difference ( Table 1 ). The changes in warm, cool, and heat pain thresholds were not significantly outside the normative data range for test-retest values. However, the post-operative increase of nearly 10°C in cold pain sensitivity fell outside the 90th percentile of the normative data. The patient showed significant post-operative increases in the intensity ratings of heat pain and cold pain during water bath testing ( Figure 2A ). Most notably, temperatures that were not painful preoperatively (15°C and 44°C) were intensely painful postoperatively, such that the postoperative change in ratings was well outside the test-retest difference in ratings from the normative data set. The 47°C stimulus became intolerable postoperatively, such that the intensity and unpleasantness difference from the preoperative ratings could not be calculated. However, the patient’s unpleasantness ratings for heat pain stimuli were elevated (greater than the 90% percentile of the normative test-retest data set) at the other two hot water bath temperatures (41 and 44°C, Figure 2B ), which indicates a significant overall increase in unpleasantness ratings for painful and non-painful heat stimuli (P=0.028, Binomial). Differences between intensity and unpleasantness ratings of the contact heat and waterbath protocols may be related to characteristic differences in the psychophysical ratings of these different painful stimuli [ Rainville et al. 1992 ]. Similarly, these protocols evoked intensity and unpleasantness ratings which differed when presented to the same subject, in the current study. We propose that the post-operative changes observed with water bath testing reflect a true difference in the subject’s perceptual system, which was not captured using small area contact stimuli [ Rainville et al. 1992 ]. The patient showed non-significant increases in unpleasantness ratings for cold water bath temperatures bilaterally. The lack of a significant change may be a result of the high preoperative ratings which precluded a significant increase postoperatively ( Figure 2B ). These unpleasantness ratings were obtained at temperatures which were not rated as painful ( Figure 2A ), as previously described for healthy volunteers [ Greenspan et al. 2003 ]. Innocuous, thermal intensity ratings changed little post-operatively (VAS change ? 10/100) and always fell within the normal range. Prior to cingulotomy, pain-related PET activations were identified in the bilateral MCC (post ACC) and adjacent supplementary motor area (SMA) bilaterally, referred to as MCC/SMA. A second region of activation was identified in the left (contralateral) fronto-parietal operculum centered on the central sulcus (white arrow in Figure 1 , Table 2 ). Based on a repeat PET scan ten days after cingulotomy, the global analysis of pain-related activations identified significant activations in the ipsilateral (right) frontal operculum, putamen and thalamus, portions of the parietal operculum in the vicinity of ipsilateral S2, and the posterior insula. The contralateral S2 showed no evidence of pain related activation postoperatively, even at less conservative Z- scores, Activation within the MCC/SMA was significantly decreased by cingulotomy (t=4.18, p<0.01, ROI analysis) consistent with the lack of postoperative activation within in MCC/SMA in our global search ( Figure 1 ). Neither pain intensity nor pain unpleasantness ratings obtained with a contact thermal stimulator, during PET scanning, changed significantly after surgery (pain intensity: preoperatively 8.6, post-op 7.7; pain unpleasantness: preoperative 8.9, post-op 8.3).

DISCUSSION The hypothesis that pain-related activation of the MCC is related to the unpleasantness of acute pain predicts that MCC lesions will decrease the unpleasantness of pain [ Apkarian, Bushnell, Treede, and Zubieta 2005 ; Rainville et al. 1997 ; Davis et al. 1997 ]. However, our psychophysical rating studies showed that the unpleasantness and intensity of acute thermal pain were increased after cingulotomy. Our postoperative imaging studies showed decreased pain-evoked activation of the MCC/SMA and increased activation of the ipsilateral parasylvian cortical structures ( Figure 1 ) which are connected with the MCC [ Van Hoesen et al. 1993 ] [ Vogt 2005 ]. These results suggest that lesions of MCC disinhibit parts of ipsilateral parasylvian cortex, and so are independent evidence of functional connectivity. This connectivity can be considered a defining characteristic of the pain network suggested by analysis of synchrony of local field potentials [ Ohara, Crone, Weiss, and Lenz 2006 ]. Perceptual Changes following Lesions of the Frontal Lobe Our results are congruent with those of the only prior psychophysical study of changes in pain and temperature perception after cingulotomy [ Davis, Hutchinson, Lozano, and Dostrovsky 1994 ]. Both studies showed increased ratings of the intensity and unpleasantness of heat pain. The prior study showed increased ratings of the intensity and unpleasantness for cold pain, while the present study showed significantly increased ratings only for the intensity of cold pain. The lack of a significant increase in cold unpleasantness may result from a ceiling effect, since unpleasantness ratings for cold stimuli were high enough preoperatively to preclude a significant increase in ratings postoperatively ( Figure 2B ). None of the thermal thresholds (warm, cool, heat pain or cold pain) in either study demonstrated a significant change within two weeks of surgery. However, the large postoperative increase in cold pain threshold (almost 10°C) may be biologically significant. Nevertheless, the most consistent finding between these two studies is the significantly increased ratings of intensity and unpleasantness of thermal pain. One psychophysical study has examined the effects of anterior capsulotomy upon the perception of acute pain in patients without any MRI abnormality. Anterior capsulotomy is a rare procedure for psychiatric disease which produces a more extensive lesion than cingulotomy by interrupting afferent and efferent fibers to the anterior portion of the MCC and other frontal lobe structures [ Talbot et al. 1995 ]. This study found decreased ratings for painful stimuli, yet decreased tolerance post-capsulotomy, in contrast to the effects of cingulotomy (see above). Anterior capsulotomy partially disconnects and disinhibits, but not does not destroy, the MCC, perhaps leading to physiological and psychophysical changes opposite those of cingulotomy [ Talbot, Villemure, Bushnell, and Duncan 1995 ]. Both cingulotomy and frontal leukotomy, a more extensive lesion than capsulotomy, have been reported to make chronic or cancer pain less unpleasant but not necessarily less intense [ Foltz and White 1962 ]. More recent studies have reported the effect of cingulotomy upon chronic pain (reviewed by [ Abdelaziz and Cosgrove 2002 ]) report a decrease in chronic pain, but not a selective decrease in the unpleasantness of pain. Therefore effect of cingulotomy upon chronic pain is clearly different from the effect upon experimental pain (see above) [ Davis, Hutchinson, Lozano, and Dostrovsky 1994 ], Differences of this type also are seen in imaging studies of acute and chronic pain [ Apkarian, Bushnell, Treede, and Zubieta 2005 ] and demonstrate that the present results can only be interpreted in case of acute pain. Changes in Pain-related blood flow in the MCC/SMA, Insula, and Parietal Operculum Our preoperative scans demonstrate a pain-related response in the contralateral frontal-parietal operculum, the bilateral caudal MCC/SMA, including Brodmann’s cortical area 24. This is consistent with many functional imaging studies [ Apkarian, Bushnell, Treede, and Zubieta 2005 ; Davis 2000 ; Rainville et al. 2000 ] and with electrophysiologic evidence of nociceptive input to these areas [ Hutchinson et al. 1999 ; Lenz et al. 1998b ; Lenz et al. 1998a ; Ohara et al. 2004 ]. However, the present results demonstrate no pain-related MCC/SMA activation after the cingulotomy. The cingulotomy lesions were consistent with those of previous reports [ Abdelaziz and Cosgrove 2002 ], and were located 3 cm anterior to the preoperative pain-related activation on the medial frontal lobe ( Figure 1 ). Therefore, the position of the lesion relative to the preoperative activation suggests that the decreased blood flow was not a result of direct tissue injury (see also {Peyron, 2000 3958/id}). However, lesions of the cingulum bundle lead to widespread disruption of connections between different parts of the MCC, and to widespread effects on the MCC. These lesions may also interrupt input arising from the pain-related structures in the thalamus and amygdalae, and thereby eliminate pain-related activation in the MCC, which was seen preoperatively in this case [ Mufson and Pandya 1984 ; Bernard et al. 1993 ]. Pain-related activations were on the right (ipsilateral, left side of images) opercular and insular cortex after cingulotomy, but the left preoperatively. This pattern would be unusual in a population study protocol of healthy controls [ Apkarian, Bushnell, Treede, and Zubieta 2005 ], although the ipsilateral activations occurred commonly in an fMRI study of healthy single subjects [ Davis et al. 1998 ]. Ipsilateral parasylvian activations have also been observed during the increased (allodynic) responses to thermal stimuli, in patients with central pain related to lesions of the brain or spinal cord {Peyron, 2000 3958/id}{Peyron, 2004 7557/id}{Ducreux, 2006 7429/id}. These results and the present postoperative results suggest that ipsilateral activations are a common factor in increased ratings of pain following brain lesions, whether clinically significant (allodynic) or not. The mechanism of the increased activation of ipsilateral parasylvian structures postoperatively may be disinhibition of pain-related inputs to these structures by the cingulotomy [ Lenz, Rios, Chau, Krauss, Zirh, and Lesser 1998a ; Van Hoesen, Morecraft, and Vogt 1993 ; Vogt 2005 ]. This disinhibition could lead to pain-related increased synaptic activity and bloodflow. In addition, postoperative pain-related activations of the right (ipsilateral) parietal and insular cortex after cingulotomy ( Figure 1 ) might be consistent with reports of activation of right inferior parietal cortex following stimulation of either side [ Coghill, Gilron, and Iadarola 2001 ]. In addition to these cortical activations we describe ipsilateral putaminal activation postoperatively but no activation was detected preoperatively. Again this pattern would be unusual in a population study protocol of healthy controls [ Apkarian, Bushnell, Treede, and Zubieta 2005 ] but not in single subject fMRI studies of healthy controls [ Davis, Kwan, Crawley, and Mikulis 1998 ]. Therefore, the observations on this patient are not unusual results for a single subject analysis of normals. Putaminal activation ipsilateral to the increase in cortical activation postoperatively may be related the powerful inputs to the putamen from cortex, including ipsilateral parasylvian cortex [ Alexander et al. 1986 ; Albin et al. 1989 ]. Ipsilateral parietal and insular activations and increased pain ratings following bilateral cingulotomy might be interpreted as disinhibition resulting from a loss of an analgesic influence from the MCC [ Van Hoesen, Morecraft, and Vogt 1993 ]. This analgesic influence may be related to opioid-mediated influence of MCC which binds to and is activated by ?-opioids, upon the parietal operculum and insula, which show neither ?-opioid binding nor activation. This disinhibition may also be interpreted as evidence of pain-related functional connectivity consistent with a pain network [ Ohara, Crone, Weiss, and Lenz 2006 ]. Implications for Pain Networks Lesion studies can be help to identify the networks related to neurologic function. For example, patients with lesions of the principle sensory nucleus of thalamus, and the parietal operculum demonstrate impaired discrimination of acute pain [ Kim et al. 2007 ; Greenspan et al. 1999 ]. Patients with lesions of the insula which spare the parietal operculum, show normal discrimination but elevated tolerance for acute pain [ Greenspan, Lee, and Lenz 1999 ; Berthier et al. 1988 ]. Pain tolerance incorporates the motivational, cognitive and affective components of pain [ Blitz and Dinnerstein 1968 ; Chen et al. 1989 ]. The present and the prior studies independently demonstrate that cingulotomy increases the ratings of the intensity and unpleasantness of acute pain. Therefore, lesions of parietal operculum, insula, and MCC each produce a different effect on pain perception, which may reflect discrete roles that they play in the pain network defined by analysis of synchrony [ Ohara, Crone, Weiss, and Lenz 2006 ]. If lesions of different structures produce different psychophysical effects upon some neurologic function, then these lesion effects are referred to as ‘double dissociation’ [ Bullinaria 2002 ]. ‘Double dissociation’ is characteristic of hierarchical networks in which component structures, such as individual cortical areas, are local networks, each serving a different function. Hierarchical networks are assumed to account for many neurologic functions such as language, in which two different modules (inferior frontal and superior temporal areas) may subserve speech production and reception respectively [ Bullinaria2002 ]. The psychophysical effects of lesions involving parietal operculum, insula, and MCC suggest that they are separate modules in a hierarchical pain network. Recent evidence of synchrony between local cortical field potentials suggests the presence of functional connectivity between MCC and parietal opercular and insular cortex [ Ohara, Crone, Weiss, and Lenz 2006 ]. The functional connectivity within such a network may be conceived of as the network properties which enable its modules jointly to process inputs or outputs or both [ Churchland and Sejnowski 1992 ]. Since a lesion of one (MCC) has a dramatic effect on the other two, these imaging results suggest that the MCC, parietal operculum and insula jointly process nociceptive signals. Therefore, analysis of imaging, lesion and synchrony suggest the presence of a hierarchical pain network which may facilitate modeling studies of the pain network, as in the case of the visual system [ Churchland and Sejnowski 1992 ].  DISCUSSION The hypothesis that pain-related activation of the MCC is related to the unpleasantness of acute pain predicts that MCC lesions will decrease the unpleasantness of pain [ Apkarian, Bushnell, Treede, and Zubieta 2005 ; Rainville et al. 1997 ; Davis et al. 1997 ]. However, our psychophysical rating studies showed that the unpleasantness and intensity of acute thermal pain were increased after cingulotomy. Our postoperative imaging studies showed decreased pain-evoked activation of the MCC/SMA and increased activation of the ipsilateral parasylvian cortical structures ( Figure 1 ) which are connected with the MCC [ Van Hoesen et al. 1993 ] [ Vogt 2005 ]. These results suggest that lesions of MCC disinhibit parts of ipsilateral parasylvian cortex, and so are independent evidence of functional connectivity. This connectivity can be considered a defining characteristic of the pain network suggested by analysis of synchrony of local field potentials [ Ohara, Crone, Weiss, and Lenz 2006 ]. Perceptual Changes following Lesions of the Frontal Lobe Our results are congruent with those of the only prior psychophysical study of changes in pain and temperature perception after cingulotomy [ Davis, Hutchinson, Lozano, and Dostrovsky 1994 ]. Both studies showed increased ratings of the intensity and unpleasantness of heat pain. The prior study showed increased ratings of the intensity and unpleasantness for cold pain, while the present study showed significantly increased ratings only for the intensity of cold pain. The lack of a significant increase in cold unpleasantness may result from a ceiling effect, since unpleasantness ratings for cold stimuli were high enough preoperatively to preclude a significant increase in ratings postoperatively ( Figure 2B ). None of the thermal thresholds (warm, cool, heat pain or cold pain) in either study demonstrated a significant change within two weeks of surgery. However, the large postoperative increase in cold pain threshold (almost 10°C) may be biologically significant. Nevertheless, the most consistent finding between these two studies is the significantly increased ratings of intensity and unpleasantness of thermal pain.

Ipsilateral parasylvian activations have also been observed during the increased (allodynic) responses to thermal stimuli, in patients with central pain related to lesions of the brain or spinal cord {Peyron, 2000 3958/id}{Peyron, 2004 7557/id}{Ducreux, 2006 7429/id}. These results and the present postoperative results suggest that ipsilateral activations are a common factor in increased ratings of pain following brain lesions, whether clinically significant (allodynic) or not. The mechanism of the increased activation of ipsilateral parasylvian structures postoperatively may be disinhibition of pain-related inputs to these structures by the cingulotomy [ Lenz, Rios, Chau, Krauss, Zirh, and Lesser 1998a ; Van Hoesen, Morecraft, and Vogt 1993 ; Vogt 2005 ]. This disinhibition could lead to pain-related increased synaptic activity and bloodflow. In addition, postoperative pain-related activations of the right (ipsilateral) parietal and insular cortex after cingulotomy ( Figure 1 ) might be consistent with reports of activation of right inferior parietal cortex following stimulation of either side [ Coghill, Gilron, and Iadarola 2001 ]. In addition to these cortical activations we describe ipsilateral putaminal activation postoperatively but no activation was detected preoperatively. Again this pattern would be unusual in a population study protocol of healthy controls [ Apkarian, Bushnell, Treede, and Zubieta 2005 ] but not in single subject fMRI studies of healthy controls [ Davis, Kwan, Crawley, and Mikulis 1998 ]. Therefore, the observations on this patient are not unusual results for a single subject analysis of normals. Putaminal activation ipsilateral to the increase in cortical activation postoperatively may be related the powerful inputs to the putamen from cortex, including ipsilateral parasylvian cortex [ Alexander et al. 1986 ; Albin et al. 1989 ]. Ipsilateral parietal and insular activations and increased pain ratings following bilateral cingulotomy might be interpreted as disinhibition resulting from a loss of an analgesic influence from the MCC [ Van Hoesen, Morecraft, and Vogt 1993 ]. This analgesic influence may be related to opioid-mediated influence of MCC which binds to and is activated by ?-opioids, upon the parietal operculum and insula, which show neither ?-opioid binding nor activation. This disinhibition may also be interpreted as evidence of pain-related functional connectivity consistent with a pain network [ Ohara, Crone, Weiss, and Lenz 2006 ]. Implications for Pain Networks Lesion studies can be help to identify the networks related to neurologic function. For example, patients with lesions of the principle sensory nucleus of thalamus, and the parietal operculum demonstrate impaired discrimination of acute pain [ Kim et al. 2007 ; Greenspan et al. 1999 ]. Patients with lesions of the insula which spare the parietal operculum, show normal discrimination but elevated tolerance for acute pain [ Greenspan, Lee, and Lenz 1999 ; Berthier et al. 1988 ]. Pain tolerance incorporates the motivational, cognitive and affective components of pain [ Blitz and Dinnerstein 1968 ; Chen et al. 1989 ]. The present and the prior studies independently demonstrate that cingulotomy increases the ratings of the intensity and unpleasantness of acute pain. Therefore, lesions of parietal operculum, insula, and MCC each produce a different effect on pain perception, which may reflect discrete roles that they play in the pain network defined by analysis of synchrony [ Ohara, Crone, Weiss, and Lenz 2006 ]. If lesions of different structures produce different psychophysical effects upon some neurologic function, then these lesion effects are referred to as ‘double dissociation’ [ Bullinaria 2002 ]. ‘Double dissociation’ is characteristic of hierarchical networks in which component structures, such as individual cortical areas, are local networks, each serving a different function. Hierarchical networks are assumed to account for many neurologic functions such as language, in which two different modules (inferior frontal and superior temporal areas) may subserve speech production and reception respectively [ Bullinaria2002 ]. The psychophysical effects of lesions involving parietal operculum, insula, and MCC suggest that they are separate modules in a hierarchical pain network. Recent evidence of synchrony between local cortical field potentials suggests the presence of functional connectivity between MCC and parietal opercular and insular cortex [ Ohara, Crone, Weiss, and Lenz 2006 ]. The functional connectivity within such a network may be conceived of as the network properties which enable its modules jointly to process inputs or outputs or both [ Churchland and Sejnowski 1992 ]. Since a lesion of one (MCC) has a dramatic effect on the other two, these imaging results suggest that the MCC, parietal operculum and insula jointly process nociceptive signals. Therefore, analysis of imaging, lesion and synchrony suggest the presence of a hierarchical pain network which may facilitate modeling studies of the pain network, as in the case of the visual system [ Churchland and Sejnowski 1992 ].  Perceptual Changes following Lesions of the Frontal Lobe Our results are congruent with those of the only prior psychophysical study of changes in pain and temperature perception after cingulotomy [ Davis, Hutchinson, Lozano, and Dostrovsky 1994 ]. Both studies showed increased ratings of the intensity and unpleasantness of heat pain. The prior study showed increased ratings of the intensity and unpleasantness for cold pain, while the present study showed significantly increased ratings only for the intensity of cold pain. The lack of a significant increase in cold unpleasantness may result from a ceiling effect, since unpleasantness ratings for cold stimuli were high enough preoperatively to preclude a significant increase in ratings postoperatively ( Figure 2B ). None of the thermal thresholds (warm, cool, heat pain or cold pain) in either study demonstrated a significant change within two weeks of surgery. However, the large postoperative increase in cold pain threshold (almost 10°C) may be biologically significant. Nevertheless, the most consistent finding between these two studies is the significantly increased ratings of intensity and unpleasantness of thermal pain. One psychophysical study has examined the effects of anterior capsulotomy upon the perception of acute pain in patients without any MRI abnormality. Anterior capsulotomy is a rare procedure for psychiatric disease which produces a more extensive lesion than cingulotomy by interrupting afferent and efferent fibers to the anterior portion of the MCC and other frontal lobe structures [ Talbot et al. 1995 ]. This study found decreased ratings for painful stimuli, yet decreased tolerance post-capsulotomy, in contrast to the effects of cingulotomy (see above). Anterior capsulotomy partially disconnects and disinhibits, but not does not destroy, the MCC, perhaps leading to physiological and psychophysical changes opposite those of cingulotomy [ Talbot, Villemure, Bushnell, and Duncan 1995 ]. Both cingulotomy and frontal leukotomy, a more extensive lesion than capsulotomy, have been reported to make chronic or cancer pain less unpleasant but not necessarily less intense [ Foltz and White 1962 ]. More recent studies have reported the effect of cingulotomy upon chronic pain (reviewed by [ Abdelaziz and Cosgrove 2002 ]) report a decrease in chronic pain, but not a selective decrease in the unpleasantness of pain. Therefore effect of cingulotomy upon chronic pain is clearly different from the effect upon experimental pain (see above) [ Davis, Hutchinson, Lozano, and Dostrovsky 1994 ], Differences of this type also are seen in imaging studies of acute and chronic pain [ Apkarian, Bushnell, Treede, and Zubieta 2005 ] and demonstrate that the present results can only be interpreted in case of acute pain.  Perceptual Changes following Lesions of the Frontal Lobe Our results are congruent with those of the only prior psychophysical study of changes in pain and temperature perception after cingulotomy [ Davis, Hutchinson, Lozano, and Dostrovsky 1994 ].

Changes in Pain-related blood flow in the MCC/SMA, Insula, and Parietal Operculum Our preoperative scans demonstrate a pain-related response in the contralateral frontal-parietal operculum, the bilateral caudal MCC/SMA, including Brodmann’s cortical area 24. This is consistent with many functional imaging studies [ Apkarian, Bushnell, Treede, and Zubieta 2005 ; Davis 2000 ; Rainville et al. 2000 ] and with electrophysiologic evidence of nociceptive input to these areas [ Hutchinson et al. 1999 ; Lenz et al. 1998b ; Lenz et al. 1998a ; Ohara et al. 2004 ]. However, the present results demonstrate no pain-related MCC/SMA activation after the cingulotomy. The cingulotomy lesions were consistent with those of previous reports [ Abdelaziz and Cosgrove 2002 ], and were located 3 cm anterior to the preoperative pain-related activation on the medial frontal lobe ( Figure 1 ). Therefore, the position of the lesion relative to the preoperative activation suggests that the decreased blood flow was not a result of direct tissue injury (see also {Peyron, 2000 3958/id}). However, lesions of the cingulum bundle lead to widespread disruption of connections between different parts of the MCC, and to widespread effects on the MCC. These lesions may also interrupt input arising from the pain-related structures in the thalamus and amygdalae, and thereby eliminate pain-related activation in the MCC, which was seen preoperatively in this case [ Mufson and Pandya 1984 ; Bernard et al. 1993 ]. Pain-related activations were on the right (ipsilateral, left side of images) opercular and insular cortex after cingulotomy, but the left preoperatively. This pattern would be unusual in a population study protocol of healthy controls [ Apkarian, Bushnell, Treede, and Zubieta 2005 ], although the ipsilateral activations occurred commonly in an fMRI study of healthy single subjects [ Davis et al. 1998 ].
