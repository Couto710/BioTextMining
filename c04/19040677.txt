Use of the Emergency Department for Severe Headache. A population-based study Background Although headache is a common emergency department (ED) chief complaint, the role of the ED in the management of primary headache disorders has rarely been assessed from a population perspective. We determined frequency of ED use and risk factors for use among patients suffering severe headache. Methods As part of the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention study, a validated self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 24,000 severe headache sufferers, who were randomly drawn from a larger sample constructed to be socio-demographically representative of the US population. Participants were asked a series of questions on headache management, healthcare system use, socio-demographic features, and number of ED visits for management of headache in the previous 12 months. In keeping with the work of others, “frequent” ED use was defined as a particpants report of four or more visits to the ED for treatment of a headache in the previous 12 months. Headaches were categorized into specific diagnoses using a validated methodology. Results Of 24,000 surveys, 18,514 were returned, and 13,451 (56%) provided complete data on ED use. Socio-demographic characteristics did not differ substantially between responders and non-responders. Among the 13,451 responders, over the course of the previous year, 12,592 (94%) did not visit the ED at all, 415 (3%) visited the ED once, and 444 (3%) visited the ED more than once. Patients with severe episodic tension-type headache were less likely to use the ED than patients with severe episodic migraine (OR 0.4 [95%CI 0.3, 0.6]). Frequent ED use was reported by 1% of the total sample or 19% (95%CI: 17, 22%) of subjects who used the ED in the previous year, though frequent users accounted for 51% (95%CI: 49, 53) of all ED visits. Predictors of ED use included markers of disease severity, elevated depression scores, low socio-economic status, and a predilection for ED use for conditions other than headache. Conclusions Most individuals suffering severe headaches do not use the ED over the course of a single year. The majority of ED visits for severe headache are accounted for by a small subset of all ED users. Increasing disease severity and depression are the most readily addressable factors associated with ED use.

Methods Overview This research was performed as part of the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study, an ongoing, longitudinal population-based survey that identified Americans with severe headache and follows them with serial questionnaires over the course of several years. This study was reviewed and approved by the Committee on Clinical Investigation, the ethical review board of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Study population In 2004, a validated self-administered headache questionnaire was mailed to a stratified random sample of 120,000 US households, drawn from a 600,000 household nationwide panel maintained by National Family Opinion, Inc. The nationwide panel is constructed to be representative of the entire US population with regard to socio-demographic features. An initial survey, containing 21 questions about headache descriptors, patterns of diagnosis and treatment, and headache related disability was completed by all household members with self-defined severe headaches. Of 162,576 individual respondents, 30,721 reported severe headaches. In 2005, a follow-up survey was mailed to a random sub-sample of 24,000 of these severe headache sufferers. The majority of the analyses presented in this paper were based on the 2005 sample. Another questionnaire, mailed to the same 24,000 severe headache sufferers in 2006, asked respondents who used the ED to list reasons why they did so. The 2006 questionnaire was used only to determine the headache sufferer’s reasons for using the ED. Study instrument The survey instrument contained 60 questions, divided into relevant sections, about an individual’s headache, medical, and psychiatric history, use of healthcare resources, and socio-demographic features. It also contained the MIDAS headache-related disability instrument, and the Patient Health Questionnaire depression screening instrument (PHQ-9). Outcome of interest The primary outcome of interest was self-reported frequency of ED or Urgent Care use for treatment of headache within the previous 12 months. ED and urgent care are joined together in this analysis because of their comparable role in the US healthcare system: a place designed for unscheduled visits for acute medical conditions by patients previously unknown to the healthcare provider. ED use is defined as subject report of at least one visit to the ED or urgent care for treatment of a headache in the previous 12 months. Similar to others, we defined frequent ED use as self-report of at least four visits to the ED or urgent care for treatment of a headache in the previous 12 months 22 - 24 . Predictor variables of interest Predictor variables were drawn from the following arenas: socio-demographic characteristics, headache-specific variables, and general descriptors of healthcare needs. The following socio-demographic variables were assessed: gender, age, insurance status, and income level. The following headache-specific variables were assessed: headache-related disability, prescription medication use for acute attack, preventative prescription medication use, healthcare professional seen most often for management of headache. The following general healthcare variables were assessed: presence of depression, use of ED or urgent care for non-headache reasons. Data-based categorizations Patients could be assigned one of the following headache diagnoses: migraine, probable migraine, tension-type headache, transformed migraine, and chronic daily headache. Categorization of the episodic primary headache disorders was based on the 2nd edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Categorization of transformed migraine and other chronic daily headaches followed definitions used in other epidemiologic studies 25 . Analysis Frequency of ED use is presented by headache type. Reasons for ED use are presented as proportion with 95%CI. Relative odds of use of the ED and frequent use of the ED by headache type are presented with 95%CI. All univariate analyses were performed twice: first for the severe headache patients who used the ED at least once in the previous 12 months and then for the severe headache patients who used the ED at least four times in the previous 12 months. For each of the variables discussed above, a univariate analysis is presented in which rates are reported in tabular form. Odds ratios, with 95% CI are computed for the population of subjects with at least one ED visit versus no ED visits and with frequent ED use versus no ED use. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine predictors of ED use, with a multiple imputation technique to account for missing data. In multiple imputation a value is determined for each variable for each individual based on the level of all other variables. We included in this analysis only those variables that were felt to have a clinically relevant or theoretical association with the primary outcome, all of which are presented in Table 3 . Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) imputation was used to generate 30 imputed data sets. Though it is common to see many fewer imputations in applications, we generated 30 imputed data sets in order to maximize the efficiency of the estimates. The EM (expectation/ maximization) algorithm for the Maximum Likelihood Estimate converged in 67 interactions, while the posterior mode converged in 11 iterations. MCMC chains were well mixed and stable at convergence, indicating good convergence of the MCMC imputations. Several of the variables we generated imputations for were discrete or categorical. There currently does not exist a good method for the imputation of discrete or categorical variables that are binary or ordinal. Therefore, post imputation, variables whose original metric was discrete were rounded to the original categorizations. Though there are known problems with rounding, including parameter bias, no sensible alternative exists. Rounded variables included MIDAS, PHQ, gender, current preventive use, insurance status, having at least one ED visit, visiting a primary MD, and visiting a specialist MD. All values are presented as OR with 95%CI. Analysis was performed using SAS v. 9.1(SAS, Cary, NC).

All values are presented as OR with 95%CI. Analysis was performed using SAS v. 9.1(SAS, Cary, NC).  Results During the year 2005, 24,000 surveys were mailed, 18,514 were returned (77%), and 13,451 (56%) provided complete data on ED use. Participants who provided data on ED use did not differ substantially with regard to socio-demographic characteristics or headache related disability from those who did not. Of 13,451 patients, 12,592 (93.6%) did not visit the ED at all, 415 (3.1%) visited the ED once in the previous year, and 444 (3.3%) visited the ED more than once in the previous year ( Table 1 ). Any use of the ED was most common in the transformed migraine group (15.5%), followed by the episodic migraine group (7.3%) and least common in the ETTH (3%) and probable migraine (2.6%) groups. Among severe headache sufferers, migraineurs (migraine, probable migraine and transformed migraine) accounted for 95.1% of all ED visits. Respondents with episodic tension-type headache were less likely to use the ED than those with episodic migraine (OR 0.4 [0.3, 0.6]). Respondents with chronic daily headache were more likely than those with episodic migraine to use (OR 2.3 [1.8, 3.0]) and to make frequent use of the ED (OR 13.4 [8.4, 21.5]). Of 859 respondents who used the ED at least once, 48% (95%CI: 45, 51%) used the ED once, 32% (95%CI: 29, 35%) used the ED two or three times, and 19% (95%CI: 17, 22%) used the ED four or more times. Of the 2011 ED visits reported by these 859 respondents, those who used the ED once accounted for 21% (95%CI: 19, 23%) of all ED visits, those who used the ED two or three times accounted for 28% (95%CI: 26, 30%) of all ED visits, and those who used the ED four or more times accounted for 51% (95%CI: 49, 53%) of all ED visits. Thus, 19% of ED users account for the majority of visits. Respondents who used the ED were asked why they did so ( Table 2 ). Unbearable pain was the reason endorsed most commonly, followed by unavailable or inaccessible primary care provider, and the desire for better or different medications. Although financial and insurance barriers were mentioned by few respondents, these barriers may be reflected in the second most commonly cited reason for ED use, unavailable or inaccessible primary care provider. Univariate predictors of ED use and frequent ED use are presented in Table 3 . In univariate analyses, ED use was more likely in females, in younger age groups and in those with low household incomes. High disability scores, use of prescription acute treatments and preventive treatments, depression and use of the ED for reasons other than headache were also associated with ED visits for headache. Multivariate predictors of ED use and frequent ED use are presented in Tables 4 & 5 . Multiple markers of severe underlying primary headache disorder, such as elevated MIDAS scores, prescription medication use, and headache specialty consultation, predict ED use and frequent ED use. However, the variables most strongly associated with ED use for management of headache are ED use for management of non-headache conditions and lower socio-economic status. Although female gender is associated with ED use in univariate modeling, it did not remain significant in the multivariate model.

Although female gender is associated with ED use in univariate modeling, it did not remain significant in the multivariate model.  Discussion This population-based study demonstrated that the vast majority of Americans with severe headache do not use the ED for management of their headache over the course of one year. This is consistent with data from other sources, in which the annual incidence of ED use for headache management was 3.5% 13 and the lifetime prevalence was 19.5% among female migraineurs and 13.4% among male migraineurs 11 . Initial headache care was provided by an emergency physician for 3.4% of female migraineurs and 1.9% of male migraineurs 12 . Although ED use is uncommon from a population perspective, headache is the fifth most common ED chief complaint 14 . These ostensibly discrepant results are explained by the high population prevalence of severe headache. Most patients who use the ED for management of severe headache do so infrequently. As has been demonstrated elsewhere, frequent ED use is uncommon among individual patients. Because of the large number of visits made by some individuals, the frequent use population accounts for the majority of ED headache visits 26 . Herein, we found that the top fifth of users accounted for the majority of ED visits. This pattern of very high use in a minority of patients is not unique to headache patients, having been reported in other chronic disorders with episodic attacks, such as asthma 27 . In this study, 79% of patients cited unbearable pain as the reason for using the ED. This is compatible with prior work from the EMPATH study, which suggested that perceived medical necessity is the most frequent patient reported reason for ED use. The EMPATH study conceptualized the reasons behind ED use in five categories: medical necessity (as perceived by the patient), convenience, preference for treatment in the ED, and issues of insurance, and affordability 28 . Apropos of these data, because the ED can provide expedited care during all hours of the week, with a large repertoire of available parenteral treatments, the ED may be, by default, the optimal location for acute primary headache management in many healthcare environments that cannot provide these services in a clinic or office setting. Healthcare systems interested in unloading headache patients from the ED may benefit by providing an alternate location for expedited headache care. Independent risk factors for ED use and frequent ED use among patients with severe headache include markers of increasing disease severity—elevated MIDAS scores, prescription medication use for acute attacks, headache specialty consultation, and preventative medication—as well as depression, lower socio-economic status, and a predilection for ED use for non-headache reasons. Medical insurance is protective against ED use after adjusting for disease severity. These findings are consistent with data from multiple other sources including headache clinical trials 29 , population-based studies 30 - 32 , and ED-based studies 24 . From the individual practitioner’s perspective, disease severity and depression are modifiable risk factors, which if addressed, may decrease the probability of an ED visit. Practitioners can identify patients at high risk of an ED visit and develop contingency plans with these individuals. From the perspective of the healthcare administrator, frequent ED use for headache can be addressed by identifying barriers to expedited treatment for all medical conditions. Targeting effective interventions at high-use individuals may contribute to a substantial decrease in total number of ED visits. We identified three non-randomized clinical studies, all of which used a before and after design to demonstrate a decrease in the frequency of ED use for chronic headache patients who participated in comprehensive headache management programs, which offered headache education and interdisciplinary care 33 - 35 . These programs were effective in decreasing the burden of illness and healthcare costs in select, motivated patients. Elevated MIDAS scores, prescription medication use for acute attacks, headache specialty consultation and preventative medication use were associated with ED use and frequent ED use. This suggests that increasing disease severity is associated with ED use and frequent ED use. A less likely explanation supported by these cross-sectional data is effective ED discharge planning. In this explanatory model, patients with high MIDAS scores who present to an ED receive appropriate prescriptions for acute attack medication from the emergency physician and are then referred onward to specialty headache care, where the patient receives an appropriate prescription for a preventative medication. If this were so, we would expect ED users to vary from year to year, a hypothesis that can be tested in future work. A second alternate explanation is that patients with more severe headache disorders are enthusiastic healthcare consumers, who use the ED, but also make frequent use of headache specialty care and primary care. These patients would then be more likely to receive prescriptions for acute and preventative medications. This latter hypothesis is supported by an independent observation that a segment of severe headache sufferers are frequent healthcare consumers 36 . Prescription medication for management of an acute attack is associated with ED use and frequent ED use, when compared to use of over-the-counter medications alone. It seems most plausible that this is a marker of underlying disease severity, although the association remains even after adjusting for disease severity. A causal relationship between these medications, particularly opioids, and ED use is possible, and has been suggested by data from other sources 37 38 . This association should not be used to deny opioids to patients who need them, particularly because recommended alternatives, such as the triptans or dihydroergtoamine, were also associated with an increased risk of ED visit. Strengths of this work include a large, population based sample and ICHD based classification of headaches. Limitations of this work include the cross-sectional design, which limits our conclusions to association rather than causality, participation bias, which potentially biases the accuracy of these results in an unmeasurable manner, and relying on an individual’s self-report of ED use, which is subject to both recall bias and the possible social undesirability of ED use. Individuals may be unable or unwilling to recall correctly if, when, and why they used the ED. In addition, we combined ED and urgent care visits. From this study, we cannot distinguish factors associated with these two sites for emergency treatment. Finally, we used imputation methods to address missing data. We feel confident in these methods because this is a standard manner to provide accurate estimates in the face of missing data and because similar results were obtained using a model without imputed data. In conclusion, ED use for management of severe headache is uncommon. The majority of ED visits are accounted for by a small subset of all ED users. Increasing disease severity is associated with ED use and is the most readily addressable factor associated with ED use.
