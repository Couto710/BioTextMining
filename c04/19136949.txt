Genetic variation in PCDH11X is associated with susceptibility to late onset Alzheimer's disease By analyzing late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in a genome wide association study (313,504 SNPs, 3 series, 844 cases/1,255 controls) and evaluating the 25 SNPs with most significant allelic association in 4 additional series (1,547 cases/1,209 controls), we identified a SNP (rs5984894) on Xq21.3 in PCDH11X that is strongly associated with LOAD in American Caucasians. Analysis of rs5984894 by multivariable logistic regression adjusted for sex gave global P values of 5.7×10-5 in stage I, 4.8×10-6 in stage II, and 3.9×10-12 in the combined data. Odds ratios were 1.75 (95% CI 1.42-2.16) for female homozygotes ( P =2.0×10-7) and 1.26 (95% CI 1.05-1.51) for female heterozygotes ( P = 0 .01) compared to female non-carriers. For male hemizygotes ( P =0.07) compared to male non-carriers the odds ratio was 1.18 (95% CI 0.99-1.41).  Methods Subjects All case-control series consisted of Caucasian subjects from the United States ascertained at the Mayo Clinic or through the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease (NCRAD). This study was approved by the appropriate institutional review board and appropriate informed consent was obtained from all participants. A complete description of the study subjects can be found in the section on Study populations and ascertainment in the Supplementary Methods . Our stage I GWAS was performed on JS, RS, and AUT subjects with an age at diagnosis/entry of 60-80 years. We genotyped 970 AD cases and 1,495 controls (JS: 381 AD, 350 control; RS: 291 AD, 787 control, AUT 298 AD, 358 CON). After stringent quality control (see Stage I Quality Control section below), we analyzed 844 AD cases and 1,255 controls (JS: 353 AD, 331 control; RS: 245 AD, 701 control, AUT 246 AD and 223 control). Our stage II follow-up analysis of the 25 SNPs with the most significant allelic association in stage I was performed on JS, RS, and AUT subjects with an age at diagnosis/entry of over 80 years, and on additional samples obtained through the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease (NCRAD) with an age at diagnosis/entry of over 60 years. In stage II, we genotyped and analyzed 1,547 AD cases and 1,209 controls (JS: 237 AD, 260 control, RS: 276 AD, 624 control, AUT: 332 AD, 116 control, NCRAD: 702 AD, 209 control). One AD case from each of the 702 late-onset NCRAD families was analyzed. NCRAD AD cases were selected based on strength of diagnosis (autopsy-confirmed: 32% > probable: 45% > possible: 8% > family report: 15%); the case with the earliest age at diagnosis was taken when several cases had equally strong diagnoses. The 209 NCRAD controls that we employed are unrelated Caucasian subjects from the United States with a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0, specifically collected for inclusion in case-control series. Age and gender data for the cases and controls in each series included in the stage I and stage II analyses are shown in Supplementary Table 1 . Sample collection, DNA isolation, and DNA amplification Blood samples were collected in 10 ml EDTA tubes from subjects in the Mayo JS and RS series, and genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using an AutoGenFlex STAR instrument (AutoGen, Inc, Holliston, MA). Genomic DNA from the cerebellum of subjects in the AUT series was obtained by Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). DNA from the RS and AUT series was scarce, so samples from these two series were subjected to whole genome amplification (WGA) using the Illustra GenomiPhi V2 DNA Amplification Kit (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ). To attenuate random amplification errors, we performed four 5 ul reactions for each sample, rather than a single 20 ul reaction. Each 5 ul reaction contained 5-15 ng of genomic DNA as template, according to the quality of the genomic DNA. These four reactions were then combined. To evaluate the quality of each WGA DNA sample, a TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used to obtain genotypes for SNP rs2830072 in both the original genomic (non-WGA) DNA and in the WGA DNA. Only WGA DNA samples that fell within well defined genotype clusters and that had genotype calls for rs2830072 that were in agreement with their non-WGA DNA genotypes were included in the series. In our hands, pooling four 5 ul reactions gave better genotype clusters and fewer miscalls than a single 20 ul reaction. Genotyping Methods The genotype data from stage I samples (n=2,465) was generated using HumanHap300-Duo Genotyping BeadChips processed with an Illumina BeadLab station (Illumina, SanDiego, CA) at the Mayo Clinic Genotyping Shared Resource (Rochester, Minnesota) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The HumanHap300-Duo chips allow simultaneous genotyping of two independent samples for 318,237 SNPs across the genome. Genotype calls were made using the auto-calling algorithm in Illumina's BeadStudio 2.0 software. The genotype data from stage II samples (n=2,756) was generated using SEQUENOM's MassArray iPLEX technology (SEQUENOM Inc, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturers instructions. The follow up genotypes obtained for three SNPs (rs5941047 and rs4568761 and rs2573905) in the combined stage I + II series (n=5,222) were also generated using SEQUENOM's MassArray iPLEX technology. Genotype calls were made using the default post-processing calling parameters in SEQUENOM's Typer 4.0 software, followed by visual inspection to remove genotype calls that were obviously erroneous, based on the presence or absence of allele peaks in an individual sample's spectrogram. Stage I Quality Control In our stage I GWAS, we genotyped 318,237 SNPs in samples from 2,465 subjects. Genotype clusters were determined using Illumina's BeadStudio 2.0 software after first eliminating 240 samples (9.7%) with call rates of <90% on the first pass. This initial quality control measure eliminated a higher percentage of the WGA DNA samples. Of the 1,734 RS/AUT samples, all of which were WGA DNA, 213 (12.3%) had call rates of < 90%. Of the 731 JS samples, all of which were non-WGA DNA, 27 (3.7%) had call rates <90%. We also eliminated 87 AUT samples (3.5%) with Braak stages of 3.0 or 3.5, so that all AUT AD samples had a Braak stage of 4.0 or greater, and all AUT control samples had a Braak stage of 2.5 or lower. Using filters available in PLINK 6 , we eliminated all SNPs with call rates <90%, minor allele frequencies <0.01, and/or Hardy-Weinberg P values <0.001. Using the sex check option provided by PLINK, we identified and removed 21 additional samples (0.9%) with a mismatch between the recorded sex and the sex deduced by evaluating the heterozygosity of SNPs on the X chromosome. We also checked for cryptic relatedness by using the --genome option in PLINK to evaluate paired identity by descent in all samples genotyped in stage I. This check revealed 16 pairs with PI_HAT over 99% thereby identifying 16 subjects for which two samples had been genotyped. Of these 32 samples, 14 were retained and 18 (0.8%) were eliminated. We eliminated one sample from 14 subjects where all samples had identical subject information and where we were able to confirm independently that the paired samples came from the same subject. We eliminated four samples (two pairs) where key subject information (e.g. gender, age) associated with the two samples was in conflict. Two DNA samples from different blood draws were genotyped in one RS subject where only one of the two samples was retained. The other 13 subjects that were retained had one DNA sample derived from the brain at autopsy (AUT), which was retained, and one derived from blood taken during life (JS or RS), which was eliminated. The duplicates in these 13 subjects went undetected because the identifiers for samples in the AUT samples, which mostly came from the brains of subjects who were not seen at Mayo, were not linked to the identifiers in the JS or RS series. These quality control measures left 2,099 subjects (85.2%) in whom 313,504 SNPs (98.5%) were analyzed. Since rs5984894 was not successfully genotyped in all samples that met quality control criteria, this SNP was analyzed in a total of 2,024 subjects (96.4%) in stage I. Of the 2,099 samples that met our quality control criteria in stage I, 1,415 were RS or AUT (WGA DNA) samples of good quality. The average call rate of 99.2% in the WGA samples was essentially identical to the average call rate of 99.3% in the 684 DNA samples from the JS series (non-WGA DNA). Thus the call rates using BeadChips were comparable for WGA and non-WGA DNA once WGA samples of poor quality were identified and eliminated. The genotype clusters for the 25 SNPs with the most significant P values in stage I ( Supplementary Table 3 ) were visually inspected as an additional quality control check. This check showed that the three SNPs noted with an asterisk in Supplementary Table 3 (rs3858095, rs2318144, and rs3007421) had unsatisfactory clusters that caused inaccurate genotyping of many heterozygotes and minor allele homozygotes. This is evidenced by the much higher minor allele frequencies observed in controls of the follow-up series where all three SNPs were genotyped well using SEQUENOM iPLEX technology. Two of these SNPs (rs3858095 and rs3007421) were eliminated by increasing the stage I call rate cut-off for samples and SNPs from 90% to 95%, but rs2318144 was not eliminated even when the call rate cut-off for samples and SNPs was increased to 98%. rs2318144 had a Hardy-Weinberg P value of 0.05 and therefore also failed to be eliminated by our cut-off P value of 0.001. These results underscore the importance of checking SNPs with highly significant association by visually inspecting their genotype clusters and by genotyping follow-up series on a different platform. The genotype clusters for rs5984894, which had a 96.4% call rate in the samples that met quality control criteria in stage I, are shown in Supplementary Figure 1a . A subset of the stage I samples (total n=347: JS n=84, RS n=183, AUT n=80), for which the HumanHap300 call rate was >0.90, were also genotyped using the iPLEX method employed with the stage II samples, in order to test for genotype concordance between the two genotyping platforms that were utilized. The genotype call concordance rate between iPLEX and BeadChip for the 22 SNPs followed-up in stage II that had satisfactory BeadChip genotype clusters was 99.8%. The genotype call discordance rates for the JS samples (non-WGA) and the RS+AUT samples (WGA) were essentially identical (JS=0.0022 vs. RS+AUT=0.0009). The effect of eliminating samples and SNPs using call rate cut-offs of 95% as compared to 90% ( Supplementary Table 2 ) is discussed in Supplementary Methods online. Stage II Quality Control To be sure that each subject was sampled one time only, stage II samples were checked for cryptic relatedness using 138 SNPs genotyped in all of those samples. Among the samples chosen initially for analysis in stage II (1,594 ADs and 1,221 controls), there were 52 subjects in whom multiple samples had been genotyped (51 had two samples, one had three samples). Of these 105 samples, 46 were retained and 59 were eliminated. We retained one sample from 46 subjects where all samples had identical subject information and where we were able to confirm independently that all samples came from the same subject. For 6 subjects with duplicate samples, key subject information (e.g. gender, age) associated with the two samples was in conflict, so both samples were eliminated. Thus we assured that a single sample was analyzed in the stage II subjects on which we report (1,547 ADs and 1,209 controls). All of the iPLEX genotype cluster plots for the variants genotyped in the follow-up series were visually inspected to be sure that each genotype that was called fell within a well defined cluster. The overall call rate for the 25 SNPs was 98.3%. Nineteen SNPs including rs5984894, the SNP in PCDH11X that showed highly significant association, had call rates of 99%. The remaining SNPs had call rates of 93-98%. Call rates were similar in WGA (98.2%) and non-WGA (98.9%) DNA samples. The genotype clusters for rs5984894 in stage II are shown in Supplementary Figure 1b . Statistical Analyses Genotype reports produced by Illumina BeadStudio 2.0 software (stage I data) or SEQUENOM Typer 4.0 software (stage II data) were used to generate lgen, map, and fam files that were imported into PLINK. The SNP genotypes in stage I, stage II, and the combined datasets were analyzed for allelic association with AD using the allelic association ?2 test implemented in PLINK. With ?=0.05 and Bonferroni correction for the 313,504 SNPs tested in stage I, a P value of 1.6×10-7 is required for “genome-wide” significance. Using this criterion, the only SNPs to achieve genome-wide significance in stage I were six APOE -linked SNPs. In the combined stage I + II data, rs5984894 and one additional APOE -linked SNP also achieved this level of significance ( Supplementary Table 3 ). Since rs5984894 showed highly significant association with LOAD in stages I, II, and I + II, and this novel LOAD SNP was analyzed in seven distinct American Caucasian case-control series, we analyzed it in PLINK using not only the ?2 test on combined allele counts but also the Mantel-Haenszel method in which the Breslow Day option was employed to test for series to series heterogeneity ( Table 1 ). We also analyzed rs5984894 by multivariable logistic regression ( Table 2 ) as described in the Supplementary Methods . The solid spine haplotype block definition in Haploview 4.0 15 was employed to generate a linkage disequilibrium plot of the genomic region encompassing PCDH11X and to evaluate the 7 haplotypes formed by the SNPs included in the haplotype block containing rs5984894. Using haplotype counts provided by Haploview 4.0, ORs were calculated for each of the 7 haplotypes, and P values were obtained with a ?2 test. A ?2 test was also employed to calculate a global P value for haplotypic association.  Subjects All case-control series consisted of Caucasian subjects from the United States ascertained at the Mayo Clinic or through the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease (NCRAD). This study was approved by the appropriate institutional review board and appropriate informed consent was obtained from all participants. A complete description of the study subjects can be found in the section on Study populations and ascertainment in the Supplementary Methods . Our stage I GWAS was performed on JS, RS, and AUT subjects with an age at diagnosis/entry of 60-80 years. We genotyped 970 AD cases and 1,495 controls (JS: 381 AD, 350 control; RS: 291 AD, 787 control, AUT 298 AD, 358 CON). After stringent quality control (see Stage I Quality Control section below), we analyzed 844 AD cases and 1,255 controls (JS: 353 AD, 331 control; RS: 245 AD, 701 control, AUT 246 AD and 223 control). Our stage II follow-up analysis of the 25 SNPs with the most significant allelic association in stage I was performed on JS, RS, and AUT subjects with an age at diagnosis/entry of over 80 years, and on additional samples obtained through the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease (NCRAD) with an age at diagnosis/entry of over 60 years. In stage II, we genotyped and analyzed 1,547 AD cases and 1,209 controls (JS: 237 AD, 260 control, RS: 276 AD, 624 control, AUT: 332 AD, 116 control, NCRAD: 702 AD, 209 control). One AD case from each of the 702 late-onset NCRAD families was analyzed. NCRAD AD cases were selected based on strength of diagnosis (autopsy-confirmed: 32% > probable: 45% > possible: 8% > family report: 15%); the case with the earliest age at diagnosis was taken when several cases had equally strong diagnoses. The 209 NCRAD controls that we employed are unrelated Caucasian subjects from the United States with a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0, specifically collected for inclusion in case-control series. Age and gender data for the cases and controls in each series included in the stage I and stage II analyses are shown in Supplementary Table 1 .

The global P value for haplotype association was 0.0007. From left to right (5? to 3?), the SNPs in each haplotype are rs5984894, rs5941047, rs4568761, rs4252206, rs370928, rs453810 and rs117393. Minor alleles are underlined. As noted in the text, the minor A allele of rs5984894 occurs on H2, H3, H4, and H6. H3 and H4 show significant association that is stronger than the association of H2 and H6 with LOAD. This could suggest that there is an untyped functional allele associated with H3 and H4, but the ORs for the four haplotypes are not significantly different from each other. Thus the differences observed may have occurred by chance alone.
