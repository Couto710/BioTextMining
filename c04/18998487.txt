Hearing Deficit in a Birth Cohort of U.S. Male Commuter Air Carrier and Air Taxi Pilots Purpose Long-term exposure to multiple risk factors in aviation may place pilots at excess risk of developing hearing deficits. We examined the incidence and risk factors for hearing deficit in a birth cohort of male commuter and air taxi pilots. Methods The subjects ( N = 3019), who were 45–54 yr of age and held Class I medical certificates in 1987, were followed up from 1987 to 1997 through the medical certification system of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In this study, hearing deficit refers to the FAA pathology code 220 (defective hearing, deafness, not elsewhere classified). Poisson regression modeling based on generalized estimation equations was used to assess the associations between pilot characteristics and the risk of developing hearing deficit. Results The 10-yr follow-up accumulated a total of 20,671 person-years and 574 incident cases of hearing deficit, yielding an incidence rate of 27.8 per 1000 person-years. Compared with age 45–49 yr, the risk of developing hearing deficit at age 50–54 yr, 55–59 yr, and 60–64 yr increased by 12% [adjusted relative risk (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98–1.30], 34% (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.13–1.59), and 79% (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.20–2.67), respectively. Conclusions Hearing deficit is prevalent among commuter air carrier and air taxi pilots and the risk of hearing deficit increases progressively with pilot age. Effective programs for preventing excess hearing loss in the pilot population are warranted.

METHODS Population and Study Sample According to the Aeronautic and Space Medical Standards and Certification prescribed by the U.S. Federal Regulation for the purposes of airmen certification procedure ( 23 ), medical certificates issued to U.S. civilian pilots are categorized into three classes based on the strictness of the medical standard (Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulation [CFR] Part 67). The medical standard applied to Class I medical certificates is the strictest. In order to have the license renewed, pilots holding Class I medical certificates are required by the Federal Aviation Regulation to have periodic medical examinations every six months. The medical standard for Class II medical certificate holders is less strict. Such pilot license renewal is mandated to take place every 12 mo. The least strict standard is Class III, which should be renewed every 24 mo. Only pilots with Class I or Class II medical certificates are allowed to fly commuter air carriers and unscheduled air taxis (i.e., Part 135), while major airlines (Part 121) are mandated to be operated by pilots with valid Class I medical certificates. Prior to January 2008, pilots were not allowed to fly major airlines after their 60th birthday (Title 14 CFR 121.383(c)) in the United States (the mandatory retirement age has been extended to 65 ears since January 2008). In order to investigate age-related safety performance among commuter air carrier and air taxi pilots, all pilots flying Part 135 operations were retrospectively selected from the 1987 records of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)’s Airman Information System ( 6 ) if they met the following inclusion criteria: being 45–54 yr of age; holding a Class I medical certificate; being employed by a commuter air carrier or air taxi company; flying for business or both business and pleasure; listing pilot or commercial pilot as the occupation; and having at least 20 h of flight time in the last 6 mo and 500 h prior to the first medical examination in 1987. A total of 3306 pilots met the inclusion criteria and were eligible for this study. Excluded from the analysis were 244 male pilots who did not have available follow-up data during the subsequent years and 43 female pilots because the small sample precluded any meaningful statistical analysis. Therefore, the study sample included 3019 male U.S. commuter air carrier and air taxi pilots. Follow-up and Data Collection The retrospective follow-up of the birth cohort started in 1987 and ended in 1997. During the 10 yr of longitudinal observation through multiple surveillance systems maintained by the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), age, sex, bodyweight, height, and pathology codes for each pilot were recorded every 6 mo based on the information documented in the medical certification process. Using date of birth and social security number of each pilot, we searched the National Death Index for the vital status. A detailed description of the study design and data collection can be found elsewhere ( 15 ). The FAA records each pathological condition using a pathology prefix (the first digit) and a pathology code (the next three digits) in the periodic medical examination. If the pathology prefix (code 1–9) was “C” or “3,” the individual was recognized as a new case for its pathologic status. Codes 200–239 provide detailed diagnoses of ear pathology. Up to eight pathologic conditions were recorded for each pilot during each physical examination. In this study, hearing deficit refers to the pathology code 220, defined as “defective hearing, deafness, not elsewhere classified (NEC) (Use with Waiver issuance or Denial only).” The follow-up accumulated a total of 20,671 person-years. In addition to the hearing deficit recorded in 1987 (baseline), explanatory variables included in this study are total flight time at baseline and pilot age. During the 10-yr follow-up, the total number of incident hearing deficits in each year was updated periodically. During the study period, if a pilot stopped renewing the medical certificate because of retirement, death, or any other reason; or if the medical certificate was downgraded to Class II or Class III, he was censored from follow-up. In this study, the total flight time at baseline (in hours) was used as a surrogate indicating the accumulated occupational exposure to aviation noise. Data Analysis The incidence rate of hearing deficit was calculated as the total number of hearing deficits divided by the corresponding follow-up time in 1000 person-years. Prior to the parametric analysis with statistical models, the relative risk and 95% confidence intervals were compared in pilots with different demographic and occupational characteristics to explore the risk factors related to hearing deficit. The contingency table and stratification analysis were used to investigate whether the associations between the risk of hearing deficit and a particular disease predictor varies across the exposure to another risk factor. According to the statistical characteristics, it was assumed that the count of incident hearing deficit cases approximates a standard Poisson distribution and the within-individual correlation among the repeated measurement follows an exponential structure. Poisson regression analysis with generalized estimation equations (GEE) ( 12 ) was applied for the statistical modeling analysis to estimate the risk of hearing deficits relative to the total flight time and time-dependent pilot age. A marginal model providing the population average disease-predictor relationship was preferred for statistical inference. Pearson residual analysis was applied for model checking. Given the intrinsic biology of disease development after exposure, the incident hearing pathology was linked to the exposure measured in the previous year. Therefore, newly developed hearing deficits recorded in 1987 and risk predictors reported in 1997 were not included in the analysis because of unavailable exposure in the former and untraceable outcome information for the latter. During the analytical process, the age of pilot was considered as a time-dependent exposure while the total flight time at baseline was independent of time.

During the analytical process, the age of pilot was considered as a time-dependent exposure while the total flight time at baseline was independent of time.  RESULTS When entering the study in 1987, the 3019 pilots had an average age of 48 yr (SD = 2.8 yr). The mean total flight time at baseline was 9857 h (SD = 5770 h). During the last 6 mo prior to the first medical examination of 1987, the self-reported flight time ranged from 20 to 850 h (mean = 287 h, SD = 144 h). Approximately 2% of the pilots ( N = 61) had pre-existing pathology of hearing deficits according to the periodical medical examination of the FAA ( Table I ). The 10-yr follow-up accumulated a total of 20,671 person-years and 574 incident cases of hearing deficit, yielding an incidence rate of 27.8 per 1000 person-years. The incidence rates of hearing deficit per 1000 person-years were 9.0, 19.4, 35.6, and 48.1, respectively, for pilots with baseline total flight hours of less than 5000, 5000–9999, 10,000–14,999, and 15,000 or more. The rate of hearing deficit was significantly higher in older pilots and pilots with more total flight time ( Table I ). Further analysis revealed that the risk of hearing deficit increased progressively as the pilots aged ( Table I ). Total flight time, which was positively correlated with age, showed substantially increased risk of hearing deficit in the univariate model ( Table II ). The effect of total flight time on hearing deficit became statistically nonsignificant after adjusting for pilot age and baseline history of hearing pathology ( Table II ). Age remained significant in the multivariate model, with the relative risk of hearing deficit increasing progressively as pilots grew older ( Table II ).

DISCUSSION Commuter air carriers and air taxis are an important part of commercial aviation in the United States. According to the NTSB, there are approximately 60,000 commuter air carrier and air taxi pilots performing a total of 5 million flights each year. These pilots work in an especially challenging environment and are known to be at a much greater risk of crashes than major airline pilots ( 2 ). Our study suggests that older age is associated with increased risks of hearing deficit in commuter air carrier and air taxi pilots. The observed age effect on hearing deficit may, to a large extent, reflect the role of presbycusis in hearing functions during the process of aging. During the process of aging, hearing function may be affected by a variety of factors ( 23 ). Some systemic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension may induce hearing disorders ( 17 , 24 , 25 ). Age-related degenerative changes may affect hearing function through impaired auditory neuron and damaged stria vascularis ( 5 , 11 ). The biological development of disease-related and age-related hearing deficits in the pilot population appears to be similar to the general population ( 17 , 24 , 25 ). On the other hand, the hazardous work environment could be a major risk factor for hearing impairment. Hearing functions can be impaired by long-term exposure to excessive levels of noise ( 13 , 14 ). Depending on the magnitude and duration of exposure, noise may lead to a shift of the hearing threshold either temporarily or permanently. Noise-related damage to the hair cells of the organ of Corti marks the initiation of the pathophysiology regarding hearing loss induced by noise exposure ( 4 , 10 ). In addition to noise, hearing function could be impaired due to the change of pressure while the aircraft is operated at different altitudes ( 13 ). This study also indicates that the risk of hearing deficit increases with total flight time. Although the effect of total flight time on hearing deficit became statistically nonsignificant after adjustment for age, the “dose-response” pattern remained ( 13 , 14 , 22 ). Since the data available for this study were collected through the FAA’s periodic medical examination for pilot license renewal, which is not specifically designed for audiology research, information regarding audiometric measurement, detailed classification of hearing deficits, and clinical features were not documented in the available database. Therefore, a well-designed observational study concentrated on the relationship between aviation noise and noise-induced hearing loss could not be conducted using the archived information. However, results from this study provided documentary incidence rates of hearing deficit in the defined occupational group during the process of aging. They may be helpful in generating hypotheses for future research on hearing problems among pilots. Although hearing pathology is not necessarily equivalent to a clinical diagnosis of hearing impairment or permanent hearing loss, the FAA uses the pathology codes to determine whether the same grade of pilot license should be granted without safety concerns. With the mandated periodic medical examination, the FAA pilot regulation systems are able to detect early signs of hearing deficits before clinical signs and symptoms bring the pilot in for more serious health care. Thus, results of this study present very important information relevant to the early stages of hearing dysfunction development. It is worth noting that total flight time at baseline is a crude measurement of exposure. It does not provide any information about off-job exposure to noise or the sources of noise during work time. In order to assess the association between noise exposure and hearing function, a better indicator is needed to measure the chronic noise exposure in pilots. Moreover, the FAA’s pathology code for hearing deficit does not differentiate cause-specific hearing problems, nor does it distinguish permanent hearing loss from transient hearing impairment. Future research should improve the measurement of both exposures and outcomes. It has been found in the general population that hearing function may be impaired during the aging process and by exposure to noise. Our study indicates that hearing deficit is prevalent in commuter air carrier and air taxi pilots and that the risk of hearing deficit increases with advancing age. Effective programs for preventing hearing loss in this special occupational group are needed.
