Metabolic abnormalities associated with elevated serum cystatin C in adults with an estimated GFR ? 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 Elevated serum cystatin C may represent an early stage of kidney disease. It is unclear whether metabolic abnormalities typically seen in advanced chronic kidney disease are present in adults with estimated glomerular filtration rate ?60 ml/min/1.73m2 and elevated cystatin C. Participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n=6722) were categorized into three groups: estimated glomerular filtration rate ? 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and cystatin C <1.09 mg/L (normal cystatin C); estimated glomerular filtration rate ?60 ml/min/1.73m2 and cystatin C ?1.09 mg/L (elevated cystatin C); and estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15-59 ml/min/1.73m2 (stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease). Among those with normal cystatin C, elevated cystatin C, and stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease, the age, race-ethnicity, sex standardized prevalence of serum hemoglobin <12 g/dL (<13 g/dL for men) was 4.3%, 8.2%, and 13.8%; serum uric acid ? 5.9 mg/dL (?7.4 mg/dL for men) was 12.6%, 30.0%, and 45.0%; serum homocysteine ?13 ?mol/L was 12.1%, 25.1%, and 41.0%; serum phosphorus ?3.9 mg/dL was 17.2%, 23.2%, and 25.8%; serum albumin <3.8 mg/dL was 14.5%, 20.0%, and 20.4%; plasma fibrinogen ?352 mg/dL was 10.5%, 21.7%, and 23.2%; and C-reactive protein ?1.0 g/dL was 7.5%, 22.5%, and 21.6% (each p-trend<0.001). Among adults with estimated glomerular filtration rate ?60 ml/min/1.73m2, elevated serum cystatin C is associated with an increased prevalence of several metabolic abnormalities.  METHODS The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) was conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 1988 and 1994. A detailed description of the study participants and methods of NHANES III has been published elsewhere[ 12 ]. In brief, a stratified multi-stage probability design was employed to obtain a representative sample of the civilian non-institutionalized US general population. Using stored specimens, serum cystatin C was measured on a sample of 6951 adult participants including all NHANES III participants 60 years and older and a random sample of those 20 to 59 years of age[ 13 ]. Additionally, cystatin C was measured in all men and women with a serum creatinine ?1.2 and 1.0 mg/dL, respectively. The current analysis was limited to adult NHANES III participants aged 20 years or older. Due to the small number of participants with stage 5 CKD (i.e., eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73m2; n=19), they were excluded from all analyses. Additionally, pregnant women (n=210) were excluded from all analyses. After these exclusions, the main analyses were based on data from 6722 participants. NHANES III data were collected by administration of a standardized questionnaire during a home interview followed by a detailed physical examination with collection of blood specimens at a mobile examination center. Questionnaires were used to collect information on demographics, education, physical activity, cigarette smoking, and medication use for diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The presence of diabetes mellitus was based on patient self-report of a previous diagnosis. Based on self-report, participants who had not taken part in 30 or more minutes of moderate or vigorous activity or any strength training in the 30 days preceding their study visit were categorized as being physically inactive. Body weight and height were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Participants were classified as having hypertension if, based on the average of six blood pressure measurements, they had a systolic blood pressure ?140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ?90 mmHg and/or they reported currently using anti-hypertensive medication. Laboratory procedures used in the NHANES III are described in detail elsewhere[ 14 ]. Serum phosphorus, bicarbonate, albumin, and uric acid were measured using a Hitachi 737 automated analyzer. In addition, ionized calcium was measured using a NOVA 7+7 electrolyte analyzer (NOVA Biomedical, Waltham, MA, USA) and values were normalized for serum pH. Hemoglobin levels were measured using an automated hematology analyzer (Coulter S-Plus JR; Beckman Coulter, Inc, Fullerton, Calif). Serum homocysteine was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, plasma fibrinogen using enzyme assay methods, and serum C-reactive protein levels using latex-enhanced nephelometry. Plasma fibrinogen was measured in study participants 40 years of age and older. Serum homocysteine levels were measured during the second phase of NHANES III (1991-1994). Low hemoglobin was defined using World Health Organization cut-points of < 12 g/dL for women and <13 g/dL for men. Due to the marked gender difference in levels, elevated serum uric acid was defined as values exceeding the gender-specific 85th percentile (?5.9 mg/dL for women and ?7.4 mg/dL for men). Serum homocysteine, phosphorus, and plasma fibrinogen were defined as elevated if greater than or equal to the 85th percentile (?13 ?mol/L, ?3.9 mg/dL, and ?352 mg/dl, respectively) while serum ionized calcium, albumin, and bicarbonate levels were defined as decreased when they were less than the value for the 15th percentile (<1.17 mmol/L, <3.8 g/dL, and <22 mmol/L, respectively) for this nationally representative sample. Because a majority of participants studied had a C-reactive protein level below the detection limit for the assay used (0.22 mg/dL), C-reactive protein levels were categorized as being undetectable (<0.22 mg/dL), detectable (0.22-0.99 mg/dL), or clinically elevated (?1.00 mg/dL). Serum cystatin C was measured using an automated particle-enhanced nephelometric assay on the Dade Behring Nephelometer II. This assay maintains a range from 0.23 to 7.25 mg/L and intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation of 2.0% to 3.0% and 3.2% to 4.4%, respectively. Elevated serum cystatin C was defined as ?1.09 mg/L. This level represents the 99th percentile of the serum cystatin C distribution for NHANES III participants 20 to 39 years of age without hypertension, diabetes mellitus, micro- or macro-albuminuria or stages 3-5 chronic kidney disease. A percentile based cut-point was chosen since it reflects a level rare among young healthy adults and is robust to cystatin C assay calibration differences which may exist across laboratories. Serum creatinine was measured by the modified kinetic Jaffe reaction and re-calibrated in order to calculate eGFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study formula[ 15 ; 16 ]. Urinary albumin was measured using a solid-phase fluorescence immunoassay; urinary creatinine was measured using modified kinetic method of Jaffe (Beckman Coulter Synchron AS/Astra Analyzer). Albuminuria was defined as a urinary albumin to urinary creatinine ratio ? 30 mg/g. The protocol for NHANES III was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Center for Health Statistics. Informed consent was obtained from each NHANES III participant. Statistical Analysis Participants were categorized into three mutually exclusive groups for the primary analyses: eGFR ? 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and serum cystatin C < 1.09 mg/L (normal cystatin C), eGFR ? 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and serum cystatin C ? 1.09 mg/L (elevated cystatin C), and eGFR between 15 and 59 ml/min/1.73m2 (stage 3 or 4 CKD). Age, race-ethnicity, sex standardized characteristics and mean levels (geometric mean for variables with a skewed distribution) of the metabolic parameters were calculated for participants in these three groups. The metabolic abnormalities studied were dichotomized as present or absent and the age, race-ethnicity, sex standardized prevalence was determined for participants with normal cystatin C, elevated cystatin C, and stage 3 or 4 CKD. Trends across the three groupings were assessed using least squares and maximum likelihood estimates for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. Prevalence ratios for the presence of the metabolic abnormalities were calculated, using participants with normal cystatin C as the reference, after adjustment for age, race-ethnicity, sex, education, physical inactivity, current and former smoking, BMI, total and HDL-cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and diabetes mellitus. The multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios were calculated overall and stratified by age grouping (<70 and ?70 years of age). To determine the discriminative ability of elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD to identify the presence of metabolic abnormalities, we assembled receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and calculated the area under the ROC curve for multivariable adjusted models with and without elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD. The statistical significance of differences in the area under the ROC curve between models including, and not including, elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD were calculated using a 500 iteration bootstrap. Two sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, the multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios for the presence of the metabolic abnormalities were calculated for adults with elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD, compared to normal cystatin C, after including participants with an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2 based on the MDRD Study equation or a newly published age, race, sex, and cystatin C-based GFR estimating equation in the stage 3 or 4 CKD group[ 17 ]. Second, participants with albuminuria were stratified into a separate category. For this analysis, the multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios for the presence of the metabolic abnormalities were calculated for adults with elevated cystatin C (urinary albumin to urinary creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g, eGFR ? 60 ml/min/1.73m2, and cystatin C ? 1.09 mg/L), albuminuria (eGFR ? 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and urinary albumin to urinary creatinine ratio ? 30 mg/g) and stage 3 or 4 CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2), compared to participants with normal cystatin C (urinary albumin to urinary creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g, eGFR ? 60 ml/min/1.73m2, and cystatin C < 1.09 mg/L). Data were analyzed using SUDAAN (version 9.0; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) to account for the complex sampling design of NHANES III including unequal probabilities of selection, over-sampling, non-response, and measurement of serum cystatin C in a sub-sample of participants. Standard statistical packages do not have commands for the calculation of the area under the ROC curve for complex survey data. Therefore, these calculations were performed applying the sample weights in NHANES III using SAS (version 9.1, Cary, NC). A bootstrap technique was used to obtain valid standard error estimates for the area under the ROC curve.  Statistical Analysis Participants were categorized into three mutually exclusive groups for the primary analyses: eGFR ? 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and serum cystatin C < 1.09 mg/L (normal cystatin C), eGFR ? 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and serum cystatin C ? 1.09 mg/L (elevated cystatin C), and eGFR between 15 and 59 ml/min/1.73m2 (stage 3 or 4 CKD).

Second, participants with albuminuria were stratified into a separate category. For this analysis, the multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios for the presence of the metabolic abnormalities were calculated for adults with elevated cystatin C (urinary albumin to urinary creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g, eGFR ? 60 ml/min/1.73m2, and cystatin C ? 1.09 mg/L), albuminuria (eGFR ? 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and urinary albumin to urinary creatinine ratio ? 30 mg/g) and stage 3 or 4 CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2), compared to participants with normal cystatin C (urinary albumin to urinary creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g, eGFR ? 60 ml/min/1.73m2, and cystatin C < 1.09 mg/L).

RESULTS Compared with their counterparts with normal cystatin C, participants with elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD were older and more likely to be non-Hispanic white ( Table 1 , top panel). Participants with stage 3 or 4 CKD were less likely to be male compared to their counterparts with normal cystatin C. After age, race-ethnicity, and sex standardization, participants with elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD were less likely to have a high school education and more likely to be physically inactive, and have hypertension than participants with normal cystatin C. Current cigarette smoking was more common among participants with elevated cystatin C. Mean BMI and systolic blood pressure were higher and HDL-cholesterol was lower among participants with elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD compared to those with normal cystatin C. Total cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure were higher and diabetes mellitus was more common among participants with stage 3 or 4 CKD. The age, race-ethnicity, and sex standardized levels of uric acid, homocysteine, phosphorus, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein levels were progressively higher among adults with elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD ( Table 1 , middle panel). In contrast, trends of lower mean levels of hemoglobin, albumin, and bicarbonate levels were present for adults with elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD compared to those with normal cystatin C. The age, race-ethnicity, and sex standardized prevalence of all metabolic factors studied, except low ionized calcium, was significantly higher for adults with elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD ( Table 1 , bottom panel). After adjustment for age, race-ethnicity, sex, education, physical inactivity, current and former smoking, BMI, total and HDL-cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and diabetes mellitus, trends in prevalence ratios were present for all metabolic factors except low serum ionized calcium, low serum bicarbonate and detectable C-reactive protein ( Table 2 ). Compared to normal cystatin C, elevated cystatin C was associated with an increased prevalence of low hemoglobin and high uric acid, homocysteine, phosphorus, fibrinogen, and elevated C-reactive protein. With the addition of elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD status into the multivariable adjusted model, the area under the ROC curve for discriminating individuals with and without metabolic abnormalities increased from 0.709 to 0.748 for low hemoglobin, 0.695 to 0.742 for elevated uric acid, and from 0.688 to 0.752 for high homocysteine ( Table 3 ). Smaller increases in the area under the ROC curve were present for low serum albumin, low serum bicarbonate, and high plasma fibrinogen. Stratification by age showed that 91.5%, 5.6%, and 2.9% of the participants under the age of 70 years and 41.2%, 30.6%, and 28.2% of participants 70 years and older were in the normal cystatin C, elevated cystatin C, and stage 3 or 4 CKD groupings, respectively. The associations of elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD with metabolic abnormalities were markedly consistent when stratified by age group ( Figure 1 ). Sensitivity Analysis Among participants with an eGFR ? 60 based on the MDRD study equation, 5 patients with normal cystatin C and 868 with elevated cystatin C had an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 based on a recently published age, race, sex, and cystatin C-based GFR estimating equation[ 17 ]. After re-categorizing these participants from the normal and elevated cystatin C groups to the stage 3 or 4 CKD group, trends of increased multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios from normal cystatin C to stage 3 or 4 CKD, were present for all metabolic factors studied except low serum ionized calcium, low serum bicarbonate and detectable C-reactive protein ( Table 4 ). Among participants with an eGFR ? 60 based on the MDRD study equation, 475 patients with normal cystatin C and 254 with elevated cystatin C had albuminuria. Re-categorizing these participants into an albuminuria group, did not affect substantially the prevalence ratios of metabolic abnormalities associated with elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD ( Table 5 ).  RESULTS Compared with their counterparts with normal cystatin C, participants with elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD were older and more likely to be non-Hispanic white ( Table 1 , top panel).

DISCUSSION The current study documents a significant increased prevalence of several metabolic factors among adults with elevated cystatin C. Low levels of hemoglobin and elevated levels of uric acid, homocysteine, phosphorus, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein have been noted among patients with stages 3 through 5 CKD. The current data extends previous observations and documents an increased prevalence of these metabolic abnormalities among a large representative sample of adults with elevated serum cystatin C who were free of stage 3 through 5 CKD. These associations were also present among participants over the age of 70 years despite stage 3 or 4 CKD and elevated cystatin C being very common in this age group and among individuals without albuminuria. Many of the metabolic abnormalities evaluated, including low levels of hemoglobin and high levels of phosphorus, homocysteine, uric acid, and fibrinogen, elevated C-reactive protein, were more common among adults with stage 3 or 4 CKD compared to their counterparts without stage 3 or 4 CKD but with elevated serum cystatin C. These trends support the hypothesis that elevated cystatin C in the context of an eGFR ? 60 ml/min/1.73m2 may represent a less severe form of kidney disease compared to stage 3 or 4 CKD. Additionally, elevated cystatin C may be useful for identifying patients with kidney disease who are not being detected by serum creatinine. This may include older and frail adults who typically have low serum creatinine levels. While the role of cystatin C as a marker of kidney disease is still being defined, the current study provides an additional impetus for future studies to evaluate the impact of elevated serum cystatin C on risk for the development of stage 3 through 5 CKD and cardiovascular disease. Despite the large prevalence ratios of metabolic abnormalities associated with elevated cystatin C and stage 3-4 CKD, the area under the ROC curves demonstrated only moderate improvements for discriminating individuals with and without metabolic abnormalities. This is consistent with previous studies showing that large effects (e.g., odds ratios > 16) are needed to substantially increase the area under the ROC curve[ 18 ]. Also, established cardiovascular disease risk factors including lipids, hypertension, and smoking have only marginal impacts on the area under the ROC curves yet lead to more accurate reclassification of patients into higher-risk or lower-risk categories[ 19 ; 20 ]. Given the strong association between elevated cystatin C and metabolic abnormalities traditionally present in more advanced kidney disease, the discriminative value of elevated cystatin C in models developed to determine the presence of metabolic abnormalities warrants further investigation. The limitations of using mild elevations in serum creatinine and small reductions in eGFR as markers of kidney disease are well documented[ 21 ]. Many studies, including two meta-analyses, have reported serum cystatin C, compared to serum creatinine, may be a better marker of kidney function[ 22 ; 23 ]. However, most of these studies focused on serum creatinine rather than equations incorporating demographics. A large study among patients with CKD suggests that cystatin C provides a better estimate of GFR than serum creatinine alone but a similar estimate to the MDRD study equation[ 17 ]. However, at higher GFR, serum creatinine estimates are less precise and cystatin C provides more valid estimates[ 24 ; 25 ]. Thus, cystatin C provides promise as a marker for early kidney dysfunction with a higher sensitivity than serum creatinine based estimates. However, there are several lines of evidence that suggest serum cystatin C may have extra-renal sources. Serum cystatin C has been shown to be associated with demographics, body mass index, thyroid function, and corticosteroid administration[ 13 ; 26 - 29 ]. There may be additional potential mechanisms for the presence of metabolic abnormalities associated with serum cystatin C, observed in the current study, above and beyond kidney function. The current findings have important public health and clinical implications as 8.1% of US adults, ?20 years of age, without CKD have a serum cystatin C ?1.09 mg/L[ 30 ]. Epidemiologic studies have documented an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease among adults with elevated serum cystatin C[ 10 ; 11 ; 31 ]. Furthermore, progression to stage 3 or 4 CKD is more common among adults with, compared to their counterparts without, elevated serum cystatin C[ 10 ]. The current analysis highlights an unfavorable metabolic profile among adults who are free of stage 3 or 4 CKD but have elevated serum cystatin C. These associations were present after separating out participants with albuminuria. Although the metabolic factors we studied are quite common in patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD, the presence of these metabolic abnormalities in adults with elevated cystatin C in the absence of CKD has not been well characterized previously and provide a motivation for understanding the role elevated cystatin C has as an early marker of CKD. The associations between elevated cystatin C and metabolic abnormalities were present for younger and older adults. Previous studies have reported the magnitude of the association between low eGFR and increased mortality is larger for younger adults[ 32 ; 33 ]. Furthermore, age-specific cut-points for defining the presence of CKD have been proposed. The current data highlight that elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD in older individuals is not a benign condition. Specifically, study participants ? 70 years of age with elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD were more likely than participants with normal cystatin C to have several metabolic abnormalities present. The major limitation of the current study is its cross-sectional design. Our analysis cannot identify the timing or cause of elevated cystatin C or stage 3 or 4 CKD. While we cannot rule out both elevated cystatin C and the metabolic abnormalities being a consequence of common risk factors, CKD is known to cause all of the metabolic abnormalities studied and milder kidney dysfunction detected by cystatin C may as well. Future studies should endeavor to determine the impact of the increased burden of these factors on the progression of kidney disease and the incidence of cardiovascular disease as well as the impact of therapies targeting these abnormalities. Despite this limitation, the current study has several strengths including its large sample size, its complex sampling design which permits estimates for the non-institutionalized US adult population, and collection of multiple metabolic factors. Additionally, all NHANES III data were collected using standardized procedures following strict quality control protocols. In conclusion, the current study documents that elevated serum cystatin C, in the absence of stage 3 or 4 CKD, is associated with a higher prevalence of low hemoglobin and elevated uric acid, homocysteine, phosphorus, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein. These findings suggest that, in the context of eGFR levels ?60 ml/min/1.73m2, elevated serum cystatin C is associated with many of the abnormalities present in moderate to advanced CKD.  DISCUSSION The current study documents a significant increased prevalence of several metabolic factors among adults with elevated cystatin C. Low levels of hemoglobin and elevated levels of uric acid, homocysteine, phosphorus, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein have been noted among patients with stages 3 through 5 CKD. The current data extends previous observations and documents an increased prevalence of these metabolic abnormalities among a large representative sample of adults with elevated serum cystatin C who were free of stage 3 through 5 CKD. These associations were also present among participants over the age of 70 years despite stage 3 or 4 CKD and elevated cystatin C being very common in this age group and among individuals without albuminuria.

Many studies, including two meta-analyses, have reported serum cystatin C, compared to serum creatinine, may be a better marker of kidney function[ 22 ; 23 ]. However, most of these studies focused on serum creatinine rather than equations incorporating demographics. A large study among patients with CKD suggests that cystatin C provides a better estimate of GFR than serum creatinine alone but a similar estimate to the MDRD study equation[ 17 ]. However, at higher GFR, serum creatinine estimates are less precise and cystatin C provides more valid estimates[ 24 ; 25 ]. Thus, cystatin C provides promise as a marker for early kidney dysfunction with a higher sensitivity than serum creatinine based estimates. However, there are several lines of evidence that suggest serum cystatin C may have extra-renal sources. Serum cystatin C has been shown to be associated with demographics, body mass index, thyroid function, and corticosteroid administration[ 13 ; 26 - 29 ]. There may be additional potential mechanisms for the presence of metabolic abnormalities associated with serum cystatin C, observed in the current study, above and beyond kidney function. The current findings have important public health and clinical implications as 8.1% of US adults, ?20 years of age, without CKD have a serum cystatin C ?1.09 mg/L[ 30 ]. Epidemiologic studies have documented an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease among adults with elevated serum cystatin C[ 10 ; 11 ; 31 ]. Furthermore, progression to stage 3 or 4 CKD is more common among adults with, compared to their counterparts without, elevated serum cystatin C[ 10 ]. The current analysis highlights an unfavorable metabolic profile among adults who are free of stage 3 or 4 CKD but have elevated serum cystatin C. These associations were present after separating out participants with albuminuria. Although the metabolic factors we studied are quite common in patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD, the presence of these metabolic abnormalities in adults with elevated cystatin C in the absence of CKD has not been well characterized previously and provide a motivation for understanding the role elevated cystatin C has as an early marker of CKD. The associations between elevated cystatin C and metabolic abnormalities were present for younger and older adults. Previous studies have reported the magnitude of the association between low eGFR and increased mortality is larger for younger adults[ 32 ; 33 ]. Furthermore, age-specific cut-points for defining the presence of CKD have been proposed. The current data highlight that elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD in older individuals is not a benign condition. Specifically, study participants ? 70 years of age with elevated cystatin C and stage 3 or 4 CKD were more likely than participants with normal cystatin C to have several metabolic abnormalities present. The major limitation of the current study is its cross-sectional design. Our analysis cannot identify the timing or cause of elevated cystatin C or stage 3 or 4 CKD. While we cannot rule out both elevated cystatin C and the metabolic abnormalities being a consequence of common risk factors, CKD is known to cause all of the metabolic abnormalities studied and milder kidney dysfunction detected by cystatin C may as well. Future studies should endeavor to determine the impact of the increased burden of these factors on the progression of kidney disease and the incidence of cardiovascular disease as well as the impact of therapies targeting these abnormalities. Despite this limitation, the current study has several strengths including its large sample size, its complex sampling design which permits estimates for the non-institutionalized US adult population, and collection of multiple metabolic factors. Additionally, all NHANES III data were collected using standardized procedures following strict quality control protocols. In conclusion, the current study documents that elevated serum cystatin C, in the absence of stage 3 or 4 CKD, is associated with a higher prevalence of low hemoglobin and elevated uric acid, homocysteine, phosphorus, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein. These findings suggest that, in the context of eGFR levels ?60 ml/min/1.73m2, elevated serum cystatin C is associated with many of the abnormalities present in moderate to advanced CKD.
