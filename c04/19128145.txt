A single nucleotide polymorphism in osteoprotegerin, an anti-inflammatory protein produced in response to infection with diarrheagenic Escherichia coli is associated with an increased risk of non-secretory bacterial diarrhea in US travelers to Mexico Background & Aims Osteoprotegerin (OPG), an immunoregulatory member of the TNF receptor superfamily, is expressed in inflamed intestinal mucosa. We investigated whether OPG is produced by intestinal epithelial cells and tested the hypothesis that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the osteoprotegerin gene are associated with travelers’ diarrhea (TD) among US travelers to Mexico. Methods OPG concentration was measured in the supernatants of T84 cells infected with various diarrheagenic Escherichia coli pathotypes. Genotyping was performed for four SNPs in the OPG gene from 968 US travelers with and without TD. Stools from travelers with TD were evaluated for the presence of enteric pathogens. Results T84 cells produced higher OPG levels in response to infection with various diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes than E. coli controls ( P < .05). A SNP in exon1 region of the OPG gene (OPG+1181 G>C) was associated with TD in Caucasian travelers who stayed in Mexico for more than one week during the summer ( P = .009) and for TD due to non-secretory pathogens ( P = .001). Conclusions Our study suggests that OPG is secreted by intestinal epithelial cells in response to enteropathogens and that a polymorphism in the OPG gene is associated with an increased susceptibility to TD.  INTRODUCTION Forty to 60% of travelers from industrialized nations suffer from travelers’ diarrhea (TD) when visiting developing countries [ 1 ]. The majority of cases are due to enteropathogens that are endemic to the countries visited [ 2 , 3 ]. Attack rates vary according to the regions visited and season of travel. The main causal agents of TD are diarrheagenic Escherichia coli with enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) accounting for approximately 50% of all cases [ 3 , 4 ]. Invasive bacterial pathogens including other E. coli pathotypes, Shigella , Campylobacter and Salmonella are responsible for 10?25% of cases. In addition to environmental risk factors, individual host genetics could influence susceptibility to TD. Recently, our group demonstrated associations between common polymorphisms the in IL-8 gene promoter and also in exon15 of the lactoferrin gene with infection due to bacterial enteropathogens in US travelers to Mexico[ 5 , 6 ]. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) was identified a decade ago as a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. OPG functions as soluble decoy for receptor activator of nuclear factor-Kappa B ligand (RANKL) and for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) [ 7 - 10 ]. OPG lacks [ 8 , 9 ] transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and when secreted as a mature protein of 308 amino acids, functions as a decoy receptor. OPG's ligand, TRAIL, and its receptors TRAIL-R1, -R2 and –R4 have vital roles in regulation of inflammation in the gut [ 11 , 12 ] and in determining T helper cell differentiation [ 11 - 13 ]. OPG also serves as an important mediator in bone physiology by blocking the effect of RANKL (expressed by activated cells, osteoblasts and bone marrow cells) on osteoclasts activation [ 9 , 14 - 16 ], RANKL/OPG also regulates dendritic cell function [ 14 , 16 ], B cell maturation and the development of efficient antibody responses [ 17 ]. OPG knock-out mice developed severe osteoporosis [ 18 , 19 ] while overexpression of OPG in transgenic mice results in osteopetrosis [ 8 ]. The systemic administration of OPG results in an increase in bone mineral density and prevents ovariectomy-induced bone loss in rats [ 8 ] and singe subcutaneous injection of OPG reduced bone resorption in postmenopausal women [ 20 ]. The human OPG gene (TNFRSF11B) is a single copy gene located on chromosome 8q23?24 and is composed of five exons spanning 29 kb of the human genome [ 21 ]. A number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the OPG gene have been identified and found to be associated with bone mineral density [ 22 - 25 ], osteoporotic fractures [ 26 ], and coronary artery disease [ 27 ]. Human intestinal epithelial cell lines constitutively express OPG mRNA, secrete OPG and express mRNA for RANKL. The expression of OPG is increased in inflamed human colonic epithelium compared to healthy controls [ 28 ]. The RANKL/OPG system is activated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Intestinal explant cultures obtained from patients with IBD release larger amounts of OPG when compared to tissue from healthy controls or non-inflammed segments obtained from patients with IBD [ 29 ]. OPG is up-regulated during epithelial infection and during, human experimental infection with Cryptosporidium oocysts. Furthermore, pretreatment of epithelial cells with TRAIL was shown to induce cell apoptosis and reduce parasite numbers [ 30 ]. Since OPG is expressed in multiple tissues including the gastrointestinal tract in response to Cryptosporidium and OPG production is determined by OPG polymorphisms, we sought to investigate if a) OPG was produced in vitro in response to infection with bacterial enteric pathogens, b) OPG increased in response to infection with agents of TD in humans and c) if OPG polymorphisms known to be associated with decreased production of OPG were associated with risk of acquiring TD.  METHODS AND SUBJECTS T84 cell culture and bacterial infection A human colonic epithelial cell line (T84) was used to study OPG production in vitro in response to enteric pathogens. T84 cells were seeded into 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium-F-12 medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution. Flasks were incubated at 37°C under 5%CO2. When the cell monolayer reached confluence or near-confluence, cells were detached from the bottom of the flask by using trypsin-EDTA and were split into 12-well cell culture plate containing antibiotic free medium. T84 cells were then infected at bacteria-to-cell ratio of 100:1 with overnight grown enteroaggregative E. coli strain 042 (EAEC), enterohaemorrhagic E.coli strain 91?8123 (EHEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli strain 115 (ETEC) in separate wells. E. coli HS a commensal strain, and E. coli DH5?, a non-invasive and non-toxigenic strain were included as non-pathogenic controls [ 31 , 32 ]. Briefly, T84 cells were infected with above mentioned E. coli strains for 3h at 37°C containing in an atmosphere 5% CO2. After 3h at 37°C, serum free-supernatants were collected from each well and human OPG was measured by ELISA as described below. Infection experiments were repeated three times with appropriate controls. ELISA for OPG Concentration of human OPG in stool samples and cell culture supernatant was determined by a commercial sandwich ELISA kit (RayBiotech Inc., Norcross, GA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, ?50mg or 50?l of stool samples were diluted five times in dilution buffer and 100?l of samples was added to individual wells in duplicate. A standard concentration curve was constructed using purified human OPG with negative control. After overnight incubation at 4°C, plates were washed with washing buffer and fecal OPG concentration was determined using the standard curve were included in each run. ELISA for RANKL Concentration of human RANKL in fecal samples was determined by using a commercial RANKL ELISA kit (BioVendor Laboratory Medicine Inc., Modrice, Czech) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Approximately 50mg or 50?l of stool was diluted five times with dilution buffer and 100?l of the sample was loaded in duplicate onto each well. Plates were processed for ELISA after incubation at 4°C overnight. Recombinant human RANKL was used as standard along with appropriate positive and negative controls. A standard normal curve was generated and used to relate optical density to concentration. Human Subjects Adult North American travelers 18 years or older or children > 16 years of age with parental consent, who attended summer language educational programs in Guadalajara and Cuernavaca, Mexico during the summers of 2002?2006 were invited to participate in the study. Visitors were eligible to participate if they were otherwise in good health, and had not traveled to an area of risk for travelers’ diarrhea within the preceding 6 months. Visitors who had pre-existing irritable bowel syndrome, known lactose intolerance, or were taking any medications to prevent travelers’ diarrhea or history of significant underlying enteric, pulmonary, cardiac, or renal disease or used antacids, H2 blockers, or proton pump inhibitors routinely were excluded from this study. Travelers completed a daily diary indicating the number and consistency of bowel movements, and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, excess gas/bloating, nausea, vomiting, urgency, tenesmus, and fever. Participants were asked to report to clinic on a weekly basis to exchange diaries if they remained healthy. Participants were asked to provide a stool sample for microbiological analysis if they became ill with travelers’ diarrhea. Appropriate treatment was given for diarrheal illness after stools were obtained for studies. Subjects were followed prospectively in Mexico for up to 6 weeks. The presence of acute diarrhea was defined as the passage of 3 or more unformed stools within a 24 hour period plus 1 or more supportive symptom of enteric infection including the following abdominal pain, cramping, excessive gas, nausea, vomiting, fever, urgency, bloody or mucus stool, and tenesmus. Written and informed consent to participate in this study was obtained from all subjects. This study was approved by the University of Texas Health Science Center Committee (Houston) for the Protection of Human Subjects. Microbiology Examination Stool samples from subjects with diarrhea were collected and transported at 4°C directly or in Cary-Blair transport media to the laboratory. An aliquot of stool was frozen for analyzing various markers. Fecal specimens were subjected to microbiologic analysis in our field laboratory in Mexico. Five individual E. coli like colonies were immediately stored at ?20°C until further processed. Stools were also examined for enteric protozoal parasites, including Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica and Cryptosporidium species, by use of EIAs (Alexon, Indianapolis, IN). Cultures for enteric bacteria were performed by using 6 standard media: MacConkey, Tergitol, Hektoen enteric, Yersinia, TCBS, and Campylobacter agar plates. The presence of diarrheagenic E. coli (EAEC, ETEC, EPEC, STEC, EIEC) was detected by colony hybridization as previously described [ 33 ], by colony PCR, or by fecal PCR using specific primers for respective virulence markers ( Table 1 ) [ 34 - 36 ]. Stools were evaluated for the presence of mucus, fecal leukocytes, and occult blood by conventional methods. Genotyping Human genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using a genomic DNA purification kit (Gentra System Inc., Minneapolis, MN) or from human saliva using Oragene DNA purification kit (DNA Genoteck Inc., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). The SNPs in the OPG gene were determined by the SNPlex Genotyping System (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City. CA), using approximately 80ng of DNA as per manufacturers’ instruction. Four OPG SNPs were studied and they are described in table 2 . These SNPs include a SNP in position ?950 of the promoter region, a SNP in position +1181 in exon1, and SNPs in introns 2 and 4. GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) was used for analyzing the sequencing data and calling SNP genotypes, which assigns individual genotypes based on the intensity and location of peaks. Statistical Analysis Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS version 15.0 software package (SPSS Company, Chicago, IL) for Windows. The association between OPG genotypes and outcome phenotypes such as microbiological, clinical data was assessed by Chi-square test. Fisher's exact test was used to calculate the association between OPG genotypes and clinical outcomes. In each case, the relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated. Continuous variables were compared between cases and healthy controls by ANOVA.  T84 cell culture and bacterial infection A human colonic epithelial cell line (T84) was used to study OPG production in vitro in response to enteric pathogens. T84 cells were seeded into 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium-F-12 medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution.

Four OPG SNPs were studied and they are described in table 2 . These SNPs include a SNP in position ?950 of the promoter region, a SNP in position +1181 in exon1, and SNPs in introns 2 and 4. GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) was used for analyzing the sequencing data and calling SNP genotypes, which assigns individual genotypes based on the intensity and location of peaks.  Statistical Analysis Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS version 15.0 software package (SPSS Company, Chicago, IL) for Windows.

Results T84 cells produced higher OPG levels in response to infection with various diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes than E. coli controls ( P < .05). A SNP in exon1 region of the OPG gene (OPG+1181 G>C) was associated with TD in Caucasian travelers who stayed in Mexico for more than one week during the summer ( P = .009) and for TD due to non-secretory pathogens ( P = .001).  Conclusions Our study suggests that OPG is secreted by intestinal epithelial cells in response to enteropathogens and that a polymorphism in the OPG gene is associated with an increased susceptibility to TD.  RESULTS OPG production after in vitro infection The OPG concentrations found in culture supernatants of T84 cell line with and without infection by the various E. coli strains are presented in figure 1 . T84 cells infected with EAEC, EHEC, EPEC and ETEC induced the production of significantly higher levels of OPG when compared to infection-free T84 cells ( P < .05) ( Fig.1 ). OPG production did not increase in the supernatant of cells exposed to non-pathogenic E. coli strains HS and DH5?. Study population and risk factors for travelers’ diarrhea Nine hundred and sixty eight travelers were included in this study. As depicted in table 2 , 68.2% of participants were female, 872 (90.1%) were white, 54 (5.6%) were black, 23 (2.4%) were Asian, and 19 (2%) were of other races. The hispanic ethnic group was composed of 112 (11.6%) subjects. Univariate analysis revealed that younger age, longer duration of stay and summer time travel [ 37 ] had significant influences on rates of diarrhea ( Table 2 ). OPG SNPs and travelers’ diarrhea Among the 4 SNPs examined, the SNP at position +1181 (rs#2073618) in the exon 1 region, demonstrated a significant association with TD among North American travelers to Mexico (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09?1.43). This +1181G>C, polymorphism, resulted in a substitution that causes corresponding amino acid change at codon3 from lysine (AA G ) to asparagine (AA C ). In contrast, a SNP in promoter region, OPG-950T>C and two SNPs in intronic regions were not associated with TD ( Table 3 ). The genotype distribution for the SNPs examined and their outcome is shown in table 3 . A multivariate logistic regression analysis of risk factors for TD in which the OPG+1181G>C genotype was included demonstrated that length of stay (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01?1.04; P < .0001), summer season travel (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 0.79?10.84; P = .01), younger age at travel (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97?1.0; P = .06) and presence of the OPG+1181 CC genotype (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2?2.2; P = .001) as independently significant risk factors for development of diarrhea. We then compared the distribution of genotypes for the SNP in position +1181 among the various racial groups. Among Caucasians travelers, 25.1% were of the GG, 47.2% were of the GC and 27.6% were of the CC genotypes. In contrast, 53.7% of African-American visitors were of the GG, 40.7% of the GC and 5.5% of the CC genotypes ( P < .0001 for Caucasians compared to African-American and all other racial groups). Since the majority of our study participants (90%) were Caucasians, and the genotype distribution was influenced by race, we stratified our analysis and focused on the Caucasian participants to decrease genetic variability. Given the influence of length of stay and season of travel we conducted a subgroup analysis that included Caucasian participants traveling for 7 days or more during summer. In this subgroup analysis composed of 688 travelers, the distribution of the OPG+1181 genotypes in TD cases was compared to the genotypes in healthy controls. As shown in table 4 the genotype distribution was significantly different. Further analysis demonstrated that travelers with the CC genotype were more likely to experience TD (23 vs.32%; RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06?1.42). This suggests that the influence of the OPG+1181 G>C genotype follows a recessive model of inheritance. The genotype frequencies were in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ( P > .05). The potential association between genotypes and agents of diarrhea is shown in Table 5 . The frequencies of the genotypes seen in subjects in whom a pathogen was indentified were compared to the frequencies seen in the travelers that remained healthy. Of the 357 subjects that experienced TD, 255 (71%) visited the clinic and provided a stool samples for diagnostic testing. We identified a potential bacterial pathogen in 145 (57%) visitors that submitted a diarrheal stool sample. Among them, an inflammatory pathogen (non-secretory pathogens) was indentified in 106 (42%) visitors ( Table 5 ). At least one of the diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes tested was detected in the stools of 128 (50%) subjects; while EAEC was identified alone or with other agents in 93 (36%) of subjects; ETEC was identified in 82 (32%) of the cases and included heat-labile, heat stable and heat-labile/heat stable toxin producing strains. EPEC were found in the stools of 62 (24%) subjects whereas STEC were found in the stools of 18 (7%) subjects. In the case of EIEC, ial and ipaH genes were found by PCR in 13 (5%) of stools ( Table 5 ). Salmonella , Shigella and Campylobacter were found in 8 (3%), 3 (1%), and 2 (<1%) subjects respectively. Overall, subjects with the OPG+1181 CC genotype were more likely to have inflammatory pathogens indentified in their stools (RR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.34?2.54) while no association was seen in the cases due to ETEC ( Table 5 ). OPG and intestinal inflammation To study the impact of the OPG+1181 SNP on intestinal inflammation, we compared frequencies of inflammatory markers in stools. We noted a significant difference in the distribution of the CC genotype among subjects with mucus identified in their stools compared to healthy controls [26 (43%) of 60 versus 77 (23%) of 331 respectively; P = .005)]. When we used the presence at least one of the markers for intestinal inflammation, including of blood, mucus or fecal leukocytes as an indicator inflammation we noted that 31 (41%) of 75 subjects belonged to the CC genotype in contrast to 77 (23%) of 331 healthy individuals ( P = .006) ( Table 4 ). OPG in fecal samples We then measured the concentrations of OPG in stool specimens from healthy subjects and patients with diarrhea. Fecal OPG levels ranged from ?8 to 1567 pg/ml for healthy visitors and ?8 to 4536 pg/ml in the case of visitors with diarrhea. The mean OPG level from TD cases tended to be slightly higher, although not significantly so, than that OPG levels in healthy subjects (mean OPG level, 186.3±504.5pg/ml for TD cases vs. 121.1±351.1pg/ml for healthy controls). Since we noticed a significant association between this SNP and clinical outcomes of TD, we sought to investigate the association of genotypes with the level of fecal OPG among travelers with diarrhea. The concentration of fecal OPG was lower in subjects with the CC genotype than visitors with GG and GC genotypes, but the differences did not reach statistically significance ( Fig 2A ). Similarly, no significant difference between the 3 genotypes was noted in the level of RANKL or in the ratio of OPG/RANKL ( Fig. 2 B & C ).  RESULTS OPG production after in vitro infection The OPG concentrations found in culture supernatants of T84 cell line with and without infection by the various E. coli strains are presented in figure 1 . T84 cells infected with EAEC, EHEC, EPEC and ETEC induced the production of significantly higher levels of OPG when compared to infection-free T84 cells ( P < .05) ( Fig.1 ). OPG production did not increase in the supernatant of cells exposed to non-pathogenic E. coli strains HS and DH5?. Study population and risk factors for travelers’ diarrhea Nine hundred and sixty eight travelers were included in this study.

In contrast, a SNP in promoter region, OPG-950T>C and two SNPs in intronic regions were not associated with TD ( Table 3 ). The genotype distribution for the SNPs examined and their outcome is shown in table 3 . A multivariate logistic regression analysis of risk factors for TD in which the OPG+1181G>C genotype was included demonstrated that length of stay (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01?1.04; P < .0001), summer season travel (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 0.79?10.84; P = .01), younger age at travel (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97?1.0; P = .06) and presence of the OPG+1181 CC genotype (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2?2.2; P = .001) as independently significant risk factors for development of diarrhea. We then compared the distribution of genotypes for the SNP in position +1181 among the various racial groups.

OPG in fecal samples We then measured the concentrations of OPG in stool specimens from healthy subjects and patients with diarrhea. Fecal OPG levels ranged from ?8 to 1567 pg/ml for healthy visitors and ?8 to 4536 pg/ml in the case of visitors with diarrhea. The mean OPG level from TD cases tended to be slightly higher, although not significantly so, than that OPG levels in healthy subjects (mean OPG level, 186.3±504.5pg/ml for TD cases vs. 121.1±351.1pg/ml for healthy controls). Since we noticed a significant association between this SNP and clinical outcomes of TD, we sought to investigate the association of genotypes with the level of fecal OPG among travelers with diarrhea. The concentration of fecal OPG was lower in subjects with the CC genotype than visitors with GG and GC genotypes, but the differences did not reach statistically significance ( Fig 2A ). Similarly, no significant difference between the 3 genotypes was noted in the level of RANKL or in the ratio of OPG/RANKL ( Fig. 2 B & C ).  OPG production after in vitro infection The OPG concentrations found in culture supernatants of T84 cell line with and without infection by the various E. coli strains are presented in figure 1 . T84 cells infected with EAEC, EHEC, EPEC and ETEC induced the production of significantly higher levels of OPG when compared to infection-free T84 cells ( P < .05) ( Fig.1 ). OPG production did not increase in the supernatant of cells exposed to non-pathogenic E. coli strains HS and DH5?.

Study population and risk factors for travelers’ diarrhea Nine hundred and sixty eight travelers were included in this study. As depicted in table 2 , 68.2% of participants were female, 872 (90.1%) were white, 54 (5.6%) were black, 23 (2.4%) were Asian, and 19 (2%) were of other races. The hispanic ethnic group was composed of 112 (11.6%) subjects. Univariate analysis revealed that younger age, longer duration of stay and summer time travel [ 37 ] had significant influences on rates of diarrhea ( Table 2 ).  Study population and risk factors for travelers’ diarrhea Nine hundred and sixty eight travelers were included in this study. As depicted in table 2 , 68.2% of participants were female, 872 (90.1%) were white, 54 (5.6%) were black, 23 (2.4%) were Asian, and 19 (2%) were of other races. The hispanic ethnic group was composed of 112 (11.6%) subjects. Univariate analysis revealed that younger age, longer duration of stay and summer time travel [ 37 ] had significant influences on rates of diarrhea ( Table 2 ).  OPG SNPs and travelers’ diarrhea Among the 4 SNPs examined, the SNP at position +1181 (rs#2073618) in the exon 1 region, demonstrated a significant association with TD among North American travelers to Mexico (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09?1.43). This +1181G>C, polymorphism, resulted in a substitution that causes corresponding amino acid change at codon3 from lysine (AA G ) to asparagine (AA C ). In contrast, a SNP in promoter region, OPG-950T>C and two SNPs in intronic regions were not associated with TD ( Table 3 ). The genotype distribution for the SNPs examined and their outcome is shown in table 3 . A multivariate logistic regression analysis of risk factors for TD in which the OPG+1181G>C genotype was included demonstrated that length of stay (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01?1.04; P < .0001), summer season travel (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 0.79?10.84; P = .01), younger age at travel (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97?1.0; P = .06) and presence of the OPG+1181 CC genotype (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2?2.2; P = .001) as independently significant risk factors for development of diarrhea. We then compared the distribution of genotypes for the SNP in position +1181 among the various racial groups. Among Caucasians travelers, 25.1% were of the GG, 47.2% were of the GC and 27.6% were of the CC genotypes. In contrast, 53.7% of African-American visitors were of the GG, 40.7% of the GC and 5.5% of the CC genotypes ( P < .0001 for Caucasians compared to African-American and all other racial groups). Since the majority of our study participants (90%) were Caucasians, and the genotype distribution was influenced by race, we stratified our analysis and focused on the Caucasian participants to decrease genetic variability. Given the influence of length of stay and season of travel we conducted a subgroup analysis that included Caucasian participants traveling for 7 days or more during summer. In this subgroup analysis composed of 688 travelers, the distribution of the OPG+1181 genotypes in TD cases was compared to the genotypes in healthy controls. As shown in table 4 the genotype distribution was significantly different. Further analysis demonstrated that travelers with the CC genotype were more likely to experience TD (23 vs.32%; RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06?1.42). This suggests that the influence of the OPG+1181 G>C genotype follows a recessive model of inheritance. The genotype frequencies were in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ( P > .05). The potential association between genotypes and agents of diarrhea is shown in Table 5 . The frequencies of the genotypes seen in subjects in whom a pathogen was indentified were compared to the frequencies seen in the travelers that remained healthy. Of the 357 subjects that experienced TD, 255 (71%) visited the clinic and provided a stool samples for diagnostic testing. We identified a potential bacterial pathogen in 145 (57%) visitors that submitted a diarrheal stool sample. Among them, an inflammatory pathogen (non-secretory pathogens) was indentified in 106 (42%) visitors ( Table 5 ). At least one of the diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes tested was detected in the stools of 128 (50%) subjects; while EAEC was identified alone or with other agents in 93 (36%) of subjects; ETEC was identified in 82 (32%) of the cases and included heat-labile, heat stable and heat-labile/heat stable toxin producing strains. EPEC were found in the stools of 62 (24%) subjects whereas STEC were found in the stools of 18 (7%) subjects. In the case of EIEC, ial and ipaH genes were found by PCR in 13 (5%) of stools ( Table 5 ). Salmonella , Shigella and Campylobacter were found in 8 (3%), 3 (1%), and 2 (<1%) subjects respectively. Overall, subjects with the OPG+1181 CC genotype were more likely to have inflammatory pathogens indentified in their stools (RR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.34?2.54) while no association was seen in the cases due to ETEC ( Table 5 ).

OPG and intestinal inflammation To study the impact of the OPG+1181 SNP on intestinal inflammation, we compared frequencies of inflammatory markers in stools. We noted a significant difference in the distribution of the CC genotype among subjects with mucus identified in their stools compared to healthy controls [26 (43%) of 60 versus 77 (23%) of 331 respectively; P = .005)]. When we used the presence at least one of the markers for intestinal inflammation, including of blood, mucus or fecal leukocytes as an indicator inflammation we noted that 31 (41%) of 75 subjects belonged to the CC genotype in contrast to 77 (23%) of 331 healthy individuals ( P = .006) ( Table 4 ).

OPG in fecal samples We then measured the concentrations of OPG in stool specimens from healthy subjects and patients with diarrhea. Fecal OPG levels ranged from ?8 to 1567 pg/ml for healthy visitors and ?8 to 4536 pg/ml in the case of visitors with diarrhea. The mean OPG level from TD cases tended to be slightly higher, although not significantly so, than that OPG levels in healthy subjects (mean OPG level, 186.3±504.5pg/ml for TD cases vs. 121.1±351.1pg/ml for healthy controls). Since we noticed a significant association between this SNP and clinical outcomes of TD, we sought to investigate the association of genotypes with the level of fecal OPG among travelers with diarrhea. The concentration of fecal OPG was lower in subjects with the CC genotype than visitors with GG and GC genotypes, but the differences did not reach statistically significance ( Fig 2A ). Similarly, no significant difference between the 3 genotypes was noted in the level of RANKL or in the ratio of OPG/RANKL ( Fig. 2 B & C ).  OPG in fecal samples We then measured the concentrations of OPG in stool specimens from healthy subjects and patients with diarrhea.

Similarly, no significant difference between the 3 genotypes was noted in the level of RANKL or in the ratio of OPG/RANKL ( Fig. 2 B & C ).  DISCUSSION In this study, we found that a SNP located in exon1 at position +1181 of the OPG gene is associated with diarrhea due to non-secretory enteropathogens in US travelers to Mexico. This is the first report of the association between OPG production in response to intestinal bacterial infection in humans as well as between OPG SNPs and diarrheal disease. Of interest, the +1181 SNP CC was associated with E. coli pathotypes that have traditionally have been associated with inflammatory diarrhea (EPEC, EHEC, and EIEC) rather than with pathotypes associated with toxin production such as ETEC. We noted little correlation with diarrhea due to EAEC, an organism that has the ability to cause non-inflammatory and inflammatory response [ 4 , 31 ]. The OPG+1181 SNP results in a transition from lysine, a charged polar amino acid to asparagine, an uncharged amino acid. This transition in the OPG signal peptide is thought to lead to decreased OPG secretion. Of interest, postmenopausal women with the OPG+1181 CC genotype have lower serum levels of OPG and increased bone mineral density [ 38 ]. Similarly, we found that travelers with diarrhea with the CC genotype (Asn-Asn) had a trend towards lower levels of fecal OPG than visitors with the GG and GC genotypes. This could indicate that a change of amino acid from lysine to asparagine may affect the kinetics of OPG secretion. Our study did not show an association between three OPG genotypes and concentrations of RANKL or with the OPG/RANKL ratio as has been shown in other study [ 38 ]. The variability in the range of fecal OPG levels seen in this study could be due to a dilution effect from diarrhea or degradation of OPG while in transit through the gastrointestinal tract, or sample freezing and processing. It is also possible that polymorphic OPG was converted into monomeric OPG [ 39 ] and not equally measured by the ELISA. OPG acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL, inhibiting its binding to RANK, and of TRAIL to its receptors [ 15 ]. OPG is widely expressed in tissues, including human intestinal epithelial cells. Several intestinal epithelial cell lines constitutively express OPG mRNA and secrete OPG [ 28 ] suggesting that OPG plays an important role in gut homeostasis and in response to inflammation. Of interest, human milk contains OPG in concentrations that are 1000-fold higher than found in normal human serum and could play a potential role in neonatal intestine and development physiology [ 40 ]. Serum OPG levels are increased in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [ 29 , 41 , 42 ], The high levels of serum OPG are thought to be in response to IBS induced osteoporosis. In the IL-2 knockout mouse colitis model, recombinant OPG modulates intestinal dendritic cells activity and reverses inflammation [ 43 ]. Similarly, we have now demonstrated increased OPG secretion by T84 cells in response to enteric pathogenic but not to non-pathogenic E. coli. OPG is regulated by inflammatory signals, including NF?B [ 44 ]. NF?B is activated in intestinal epithelial cells in response to a number of inflammatory responses and it up regulates OPG expression. OPG may, in turn, blunt the inflammatory effects of RANKL and TRAIL. It is plausible that low OPG levels might worsen the clinical presentation in patients exposed to invasive pathogens. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that OPG functions as an anti-inflammatory mediator in the gut that increases in response to intestinal infection. SNPs in the OPG gene that result in low production of OPG may lead to more severe clinical manifestations, in subjects with infection due to non-secretory organisms. There are several limitations to this study. First, all travelers with diarrhea did not provide stool samples for microbiology, OPG, and RANKL assays. Secondly, we did not include a control group to evaluate the role of OPG/RANKL in response to asymptomatic colonization with pathogens to further confirm the association of this OPG+1181G>C SNP with symptomatic disease. Thirdly, the exposure to diarrheal causing agents may have not been uniform among participants, as travelers report variable degrees of adherence to avoid risk food items. There is also the potential for the false associations due to multiple comparisons. Controversy exists on the appropriateness of statistical adjustments such as the Bonferroni correction in this setting, which some find is too conservative for an exploratory association study. Additional studies will be needed to confirm this observation in other study populations. In conclusion, our in vitro cell culture infection model suggests that OPG is secreted by intestinal epithelial cells in response to invasive enteropathogens and that a SNP in exon1 (OPG+1181G>C), of the OPG gene is associated with susceptibility to inflammatory diarrhea in North American travelers to Mexico. The study of OPG and its SNPs may be of use in further understanding host susceptibility and the intestinal immune response to enteropathogens.
