NF-?B-Mediated HER2 Overexpression in Radiation-Adaptive Resistance The molecular mechanisms governing acquired tumor resistance during radiotherapy remain to be elucidated. In breast cancer patients, overexpression of HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is correlated with aggressive tumor growth and increased recurrence. In the present study, we demonstrate that HER2 expression can be induced by radiation in breast cancer cells with a low basal level of HER2. Furthermore, HER2 -postive tumors occur at a much higher frequency in recurrent invasive breast cancer (59%) compared to the primary tumors (41%). Interestingly, NF-?B is required for radiation-induced HER2 transactivation. HER2 was found to be co-activated with basal and radiation-induced NF-?B activity in radioresistant but not radiosensitive breast cancer cell lines after long-term radiation exposure, indicating that NF-?B-mediated HER2 overexpression is involved in radiation-induced repopulation in heterogeneous tumors. Finally, we found that inhibition of HER2 resensitizes the resistant cell lines to radiation. Since HER2 is shown to activate NF-?B, our data suggest a loop-like HER2-NF-?B-HER2 pathway in radiation-induced adaptive resistance in breast cancer cells.  INTRODUCTION In the clinic, radiation therapy is a powerful anti-cancer modality. Recent data suggest that radiation-induced stress response and gene expression with an adaptive resistance may severely compromise the effectiveness of radiation ( 1 ). Although radiation-induced genomic instability and by-stander effects are known to modulate cell radiosensitivity ( 2 ), specific signaling networks causing the adaptive radio-resistance in tumor cells remain to be elucidated. In mammalian cells, different protein expression patterns can be induced by ionizing radiation, suggesting that the fate of an irradiated cell may be controlled by a specific survival signaling network ( 3 , 4 ). A tumor may consist of several specific cell subpopulations that may respond differently to therapeutic irradiation ( 5 ). Long-term observations of irradiated cell populations reveal a variety of cell fates ( 6 ). This wide inconsistency in radiosensitivity of a given tumor cell population suggests that heterogeneity in the signal transduction response could represent a mechanism for the development of adaptive tumor resistance. HER2 belongs to the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) family and plays an important role in cell proliferation through homodimerization or formation of heterodimers with EGFR and HER3 ( 7 ). Although HER2 overexpression, either through gene amplification or dysregulation, has been identified in many other human cancers, about 30% of human breast cancers overexpress HER2 ( 8 ). In addition to HER2-mediated cell transformation ( 9 ), the HER2-induced tumor aggressive phenotype has been linked with enhanced activity of proliferative signaling ( 10 , 11 ), EGFR induction, cell cycle checkpoint dysregulation ( 12 ), and ubiquitination-mediated p53 degradation ( 13 ). HER2 is being studied extensively as a therapeutic target ( 14 , 15 ). However, to further improve HER2-targeted therapy, it is essential to determine whether HER2 is inducible by anti-cancer modalities and whether the induced HER2 overexpression is responsible for acquired radioresistance. The stress-responsive transcription factor NF-?B is activated by a variety of cytotoxic conditions through phosphorylation of the inhibitor by I?B kinase (IKK) ( 16 , 17 ), which is believed to be a critical factor in enhancing cell survival after irradiation ( 18 – 22 ). NF-?B activation through the PI3K/Akt pathway is also a major downstream event of HER2 overexpression ( 7 , 23 , 24 ). Although NF-?B activation can decrease cellular radiosensitivity ( 21 , 25 ), the exact correlation between NF-?B activation and HER2 overexpression in tumor adaptive radioresistance is unclear. We have studied breast cancer cell lines, mouse xenograft tumors, and recurrent invasive breast cancers, and we have found that radiation-induced HER2 up-regulation by NF-?B regulation is causally linked to the adaptive radioresistance. NF-?B-mediated HER2 overexpression is tightly associated with the heterogeneous pattern of radioresistance detected in the surviving cells of breast cancer cell lines treated with long-term fractionated ? radiation. NF-?B inhibitor (IMD-0354), NF-?B p65 siRNA, or HER2 siRNA inhibits HER2 overexpression and reverses the radioresistant phenotype of the radioresistant cell lines. Our results suggest a potential approach to prevent and resensitize therapy-resistant breast tumors by targeting NF-?B/HER2 pathways.  METHODS AND MATERIALS Cell Culture Cells of the human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). MCF+FIR cells were obtained as described previously ( 21 , 24 ). Cells of the MCF-7 cell line stably transfected with HER2 (MCF-7/ HER2 ) were kindly provided by Dr. D. J. Slamon (University of California Los Angeles). MCF-7, MCF+FIR and MCF-7/ HER2 cells were maintained in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT), 5% sodium pyruvate, 5% non-essential amino acid, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 µg/ml) in a humidified incubator (95% air/5% CO2) at 37°C. MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in EMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 5% nonessential amino acid, 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin. Derivation of the Heterogeneous MDA+FIR Cell Population To establish a MDA-MB-231 cell population that survives a long-term therapeutic fractionated irradiation, we followed the in vitro irradiation procedure described previously ( 21 ). The radiation treatment was started with cells cultured in T-75 flasks (1 × 107 cells) with a total dose of 30 Gy ? rays (1 Gy per fraction, five times per week for 6 weeks). Parental MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the same procedure except that they were sham-irradiated and passaged with the irradiated cells as sham-irradiated controls. Both irradiated-treated and sham-irradiated control MDA-MB-231 cells were passaged every 7 days before the 10th irradiation and were passaged every 10 days after the 10th irradiation (fewer MDA-MB-231 cells were plated to achieve a similar passage number for further experiments). Cells were fed with fresh MDA-MB-231 cell medium every 3 days. Two weeks after the final irradiation, a group of cell clones isolated from the irradiated MDA-MB-231 cell population (MDA+FIR) were cultured individually and passaged in the same medium, and all experiments were performed during 4 to 10 passages after the establishment of individual clones. All irradiations were conducted at room temperature using a GR-12 irradiator to expose cells to 60Co ? rays (dose rate, 2.3 Gy/min; U.S. Nuclear Corp., Burbank, CA). Real-Time PCR Total RNAs were prepared from cultured cells using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Total RNA (2 µg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using an AMV reverse transcriptase kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Real-time PCR was performed using the BioRad My IQ real-time PCR system and the BioRad SYBR Green supermix following the manufacturer’s protocol (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The quantitative RT-PCR primers were as follows: HER2 , 5? GGAGAACCCCGAGTACTTGAC 3? (sense) and 5? GTTCTCTGCCGTAGGTGTCC 3? (antisense); GAPDH , 5? GGACTCATGACCACA GTCCAT 3? (sense) and 5? GTTCAGCTC AGGGATGACCTT 3? (antisense). The cycle conditions for the PCR were one cycle of 3 min at 95°C, 45 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at the 60°C, and 30 s at 72°C. Data were expressed as arbitrary units. Western Blotting Total cell lysates (20 µg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes. Each membrane was incubated with specific primary antibody overnight at 4°C followed by the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and then visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). HER2 antibody (MS-730-P) was purchased from Lab Vision Corporation (Fremont, CA); p65 and ?-actin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), respectively. Irradiation of Mouse Xenograft Tumor A standard cell inoculation was used to generate mouse breast cancer xenograft tumors with MDA-MB-231 cells following the protocol approved by the committee for animal research at Purdue University. At the age of 7 weeks, mice were injected with 5 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells in the axilla. Mice were euthanized before the tumor volume reached 3500 mm3. Three weeks after the last cell inoculation, the average size of the MDA-MB-231 xenograft is 2300 mm3. The mice were divided into two groups: one received sham-irradiated and the other received ? rays (2 Gy/day, dose rate: 2.3 Gy/min, for 3 times, total dose 6 Gy) from the GR-12 irradiator. The mice were anesthetized by injection of ketamine before irradiation. Twenty-four hours after the last radiation treatment, mice were killed humanely and tumor tissues were prepared for different experiments. Immunohistochemistry Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded xenograft tumor sections were deparaffined in xylene twice for 5 min each, incubated in 100% ethanol for 5 min, and then hydrated by placing in 90, 80 and 70% ethanol for 5 min each. After the slides were washed with PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) for 5 min, they were incubated with permeabilization solution (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBST. Then the slides were blocked with 2% BSA in PBST for 1 h at room temperature followed by three washes. The slides were incubated with anti-mouse HER2 primary antibody overnight at 4°C followed by three washes and then incubation with the secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Texas Red (Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then incubated with DAPI (300 n M in PBS) for 5 min at room temperature followed by two washes and then were sealed and analyzed with a Nikon microscope (Eclipse, E1000M). Analysis of HER2 Expression in Recurrent Breast Cancers The pathology database was searched for invasive breast cancer, and cases with clinical follow-up were retrieved after obtaining Institutional Review Board approval (Emory University IRB#: 901–2004). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections (5 µ M ) were prepared. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the Herceptest kit (DakoCytomation) after heat-induced epitope retrieval. Moderate to strong membrane staining in more than 10% of the tumor cells was considered positive for HER2 expression. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using a PathVysion kit (Vysis, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A centromere 17:HER2 probe signal ratio of more than 2.2 obtained from 30 interphase nuclei was considered positive for HER2 gene amplification. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured for 24 h before treatment with ? rays or NF-?B inhibitors (2 µ M IMD-0354 for 5 h or mutant I ? B ? transient transfection), and soluble chromatin was crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde at 37°C for 10 min. Cell extracts were prepared and sonicated to obtain DNA fragments with sizes between 0.2 and 0.7 kb. Protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-p65 (5 µg, sc-372; Santa Cruz), anti-p50 (5 µg, 06-886; Upstate), anti-p52 (5 µg, sc-848X; Santa Cruz), and anti-c-Rel (5 µg, sc-1827X; Santa Cruz) antibodies or IgG control, respectively. DNA was purified and used for PCR with primers specific for the gene promoter region encompassing the NF-?B binding site. The following primers were used: HER2 (A), 5? GAG TGG CAGCCTAGGGAATTTACT 3? (forward) and 5? TATACTTCCTCAAGCAGCCCTCC 3? (reverse); I ? B ?, 5? GTAGCACCCATTAG AAACACTTC (forward) 3? and 5? TTCTTGTTCACTG ACTTCCCAA TA 3? (reverse); GAPDH , 5? GGACTCATGACCACAGTCCAT 3? (forward) and 5? GTTCAGCTCAGGGATGACCTT 3? (reverse); B (the sequence around 1.4 kb upward of NF-?B binding site), 5? AGGCCCCTGTTTCTCAACTCCCTA 3? (forward) and 5? GTATAGCTGCATTCTT GGCTGGGG 3? (reverse). Transfection and Luciferase Assay Plasmid containing the HER2 promoter region (pGL2-basic-HER2) was a gift from Dr. Mien-Chie Hung at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The pGL2-basic-HER2-?NF-?B, in which the NF-?B binding site (gggacgaccc; ?364 to ?355) was deleted from the HER2 promoter region, was amplified by PCR with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the primer sequences: 5? GGCGTCCCGGCGCTAGGAAGGCCTGCGCAGAGAG 3? (sense) and 5? CTC TCTTCGCGCAGGCCTTCCTAGCGCCGGGACGCC 3? (anti-sense). Transfection of pGL2-basic-HER2 or pGL2-basic-HER2-?NF-?B luciferase reporter plasmid was described previously ( 26 ). Luciferase activity was measured with Luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI). For normalization of the reporter transfection efficiency, the total protein concentration of lysates was measured with the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) with BSA as the standard. IMD-0354 and Mutant I?B Treatment IMD-0354 (Sigma), an efficient IKK? inhibitor that inhibits the activation of NF-?B through I?B? phosphorylation ( 27 ), was used to block NF-?B activation (2 µ M for 5 h incubation). The mutant I?B? (S32A, S36A) conjugated plasmid was used to transiently inhibit NF-?B activation by retaining NF-?B in the cytoplasm. Cells grown in complete medium with or without IMD-0354 incubation or mutant I?B? transfection were sham-irradiated or exposed to 5 Gy ? rays. NF-?B or HER2 activity and radiation sensitivity were measured by a luciferase assay and clonogenic survival assays, respectively. Western blotting was performed to measure the expression of HER2 with or without treatment. siRNA-Mediated Target Gene Inhibition siRNA targeting HER2 or p65 mRNAs was designed and synthesized with the Silencer siRNA Construction Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The primers used to synthesize the siRNAs were as follows: HER2 , 5? AACAGGTAGGTCAGTTCCAGGCCTGTCTC 3? (sense) and 5? AACCTGGAACTCACC TACCTGCCTGTCTC 3? (antisense); p65 , 5? AAGGTGGGAAACTCATCATAGCCTGTCTC 3? (sense) and 5? AACTATGATG AGTTTCCCACCCCTGTCTC 3? (antisense). Cells were seeded to achieve 30–50% confluence on the day of transfection. Transient transfection of siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen). In brief, cells were seeded in 35-mm plates and cultured in antibiotic-free medium for 24 h and then were transfected with various concentrations of siRNAs. Scrambled RNA Duplex (Ambion, Austin, TX) served as the control. HER2 expression in transiently transfected cells was analyzed by Western blotting 60 h after transfection. All transfectants were maintained in antibiotic-free complete medium until collection for further analysis. Clonogenic Survival Assay Standard radiation clonogenic survival assays were performed as described previously ( 24 ) after exposure to various doses of ? rays. Different numbers of cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes after treatments with IMD-0354 (2 µ M for 5 h incubation), p65 siRNA (20 n M for 60 h), or HER2 siRNA (20 n M for 60 h) with or without radiation. Each treatment was performed in three dishes, and all experiments were repeated in triplicate. The treated and control cells were cultured for 14 days, and colonies with more than 50 cells were scored and normalized to the plating efficiency of each cell line. Statistics The significance of differences between groups was analyzed using the two-tailed Student’s t test.  Cell Culture Cells of the human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). MCF+FIR cells were obtained as described previously ( 21 , 24 ).

RESULTS HER2 Expression in Irradiated Cells and in Recurrent Invasive Breast Cancers Figure 1A–C shows that HER2 transactivation detected by mRNA levels was enhanced in breast cancer MCF-7 ( Fig. 1A ) and MDA-MB-231 ( Fig. 1B ) cells 24 h after exposure to a single dose of 5 Gy. The MCF-7/ HER2 transfectants that were induced to overexpress HER2 by stable gene transfection ( 24 ) did not show a similar endogenous HER2 gene activation ( Fig. 1C ), indicating that breast cancer cells low in or lacking HER2 expression are sensitive to radiation-mediated HER2 gene activation. Consistent with this result, 5 Gy of ? rays significantly induced HER2 protein levels in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, which normally express low levels of HER2, but not in the positive control MCF-7/ HER2 cells exposed to radiation ( Fig. 1D ). In addition, compared to the wild type MCF-7 cells, the MCF+FIR cells (MCF-7 cells surviving a long-term fractionated irradiation) ( 21 ) showed increased HER2 protein levels ( Fig. 1E ) that was similar to that of MCF-7/ HER2 cells. HER2 induction was further confirmed in in vivo irradiated mouse xenograft tumors of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with radiation (3 × 2 Gy ? rays separated by 24 h). Immunohistochemistry ( Fig. 1F ; Supplementary Fig. S1 ) and Western blotting ( Fig. 1G ) analysis of HER2 revealed an obvious HER2 induction in irradiated tumors compared to the sham-irradiated control tumor. We then studied HER2 expression rate in primary (102 cases) and recurrent invasive (78 cases) tumors from a group of clinically diagnosed breast cancer patients (total cases 180). As shown in Fig. 1H , HER2-postive tumors detected by immunohistochemistry were detected more frequently in the recurrent tumors (59%, 46/78) than in the primary (41%, 42/102) breast cancers. There was no difference in HER2 gene amplification in primary (33%, 48/144) and recurrent (34%, 23/67) tumors detected by the standard FISH analysis that is based on the HER2 gene copy numbers. Collectively, these results suggest that HER2 overexpression is linked with adaptive tumor resistance. Radiation Enhanced the Recruitment of NF-?B to HER2 Promoter NF-?B plays a central role in radiation resistance ( 28 , 29 ). To determine whether radiation-induced NF-?B regulates HER2 expression, we analyzed the HER2 promoter region by searching the Transcription Element Search System (TESS) database. The NF-?B binding site (gggacgaccc; ?364 to ?355) was found in the human HER2 promoter region ( 30 ). We then designed two fragments of HER2 promoter for ChIP analysis (A and B in Fig. 2A ). Fragment A was from ?494 to ?200 encompassing the NF-?B binding site (?364 to ?355), and fragment B was located 1.4 kb upward of A without NF-?B binding site as a negative control. The ChIP results ( Fig. 2B ) revealed that p65 and p50, which form the major NF-?B complex, were detected in fragment A but not fragment B of the HER2 promoter. The other NF-?B subunits p52 and c-Rel were negligible in the remainder of the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The recruitment of p65 and p50 but not p52 and c-Rel to the HER2 promoter was significantly enhanced 16 h after exposure to 5 Gy. In contrast to another NF-?B-regulated promoter, radiation enhanced the recruitment of all the NF-?B subunits to I ? B ? promoter, a known NF-?B target gene ( 31 ). These results suggest that the p65/p50 complex of NF-?B ( 32 ) is specifically involved in radiation-induced HER2 overexpression. Recruitment of p65/p50 to the HER2 promoter was also confirmed in MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors irradiated in vivo using the I ? B ? promoter as the positive control ( Fig. 2C ). Figure 2D shows that inhibition of NF-?B by transfection of mutant I ? B ? (m I ? B ?) or treatment with IMD-0354 (2 µ M , 5 h), a selective IKK? inhibitor ( 27 ), dramatically reduced radiation-induced recruitment of p65/p50 to the promoters of HER2 and the control I ? B ?. Figure 2E shows the estimated values of reduced NF-?B binding to the promoters of HER2 and I ? B ?. Thus the NF-?B p65/p50 complex is specifically required for radiation-induced HER2 transactivation. NF-?B Activation is Required for Radiation-Induced HER2 Overexpression MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with NF-?B luciferase reporters were treated with 2 µ M IMD-0354 for 5 h before irradiation with 5 Gy. IMD-0354 dramatically reduced both basal and radiation-induced NF-?B activity ( Fig. 3A ). Compared to wild-type HER2 promoter activity, radiation-induced luciferase activity of pGL2-enhancer- HER2 -?NF-?B (with a deleted NF-?B binding site) was absent ( Fig. 3B ). Figure 3C shows that IMD-0354 reduced both basal and radiation-induced HER2 promoter activity, and, consistent with the inhibited reporter activity, HER2 expression was reduced by IMD-0354 ( Fig. 3D ). NF-?B inhibition by p65 siRNA (20–40 n M ) significantly blocked p65 expression ( Fig. 3E ), and in turn, p65 siRNA effectively inhibited radiation-induced HER2 promoter transactivation ( Fig. 3F ). Inhibition of NF-?B by mutant m I ? B transfection also reduced radiation-induced HER2 protein expression ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). NF-?B-Mediated HER2 Overexpression is Linked to Radioresistance Tumor repopulation after fractionated irradiation has been linked to the failure of treatment by radiotherapy ( 1 ) due to the heterogeneous radiosensitivity among cancer cells ( 33 ). To determine whether HER2 overexpression is associated with the radioresistance in the heterogeneous cell population, we tested HER2 expression in a breast cancer cell population (MDA+FIR) derived from MDA-MB-231 cells after long-term fractionated ?-ray treatments (1 Gy/day for 30 fractions, total dose 30 Gy). A striking difference in HER2 expression levels was detected among the cloned cell lines isolated from the MDA+FIR cell population (C1, C2, C4, C5, C9 and C13) ( Fig. 4A ). Both the basal and radiation-induced NF-?B activities were elevated predominantly in the cell lines with higher HER2 expression ( Fig. 4B ). Furthermore, an enhanced clonogenic survival of the cloned cell line was tightly correlated to NF-?B activity and HER2 protein levels ( Fig. 4C ). The dose-modifying factor (DMF) at 10% isosurvival was 1.0 for C13, 1.1 for C2, 1.3 for C1 and C9, and 1.7 for C4 and C5, which was significantly increased with the activation of the NF-?B/HER2 pathway. Two of six MDA+FIR cell lines (C2 and C13) showed no induction of HER2 expression and demonstrated similar radiosensitivity to the sham-irradiated parental MDA-MB-231 cells as measured by clonogenic survival. Four MDA+FIR cell lines (C1, C4, C5 and C9) showed an enhanced HER2 expression with a significantly higher survival rate. Radiosensitization by NF-?B/HER2 Inhibition IMD-0354 inhibited the expression of HER2 in MCF+FIR cells, but relatively less inhibition was observed in MCF-7/ HER2 cells ( Fig. 5A ), confirming that the radiation-induced endogenous HER2 expression was controlled by NF-?B. IMD-0354 efficiently reduced the overexpression of HER2 in the radioresistant cell lines C4 and C5 but not the radiosensitive C2 cells ( Fig. 5B ). Consistent with the HER2 reduction, IMD-0354 reduced the clonogenicity of MCF+FIR but not MCF-7/ HER2 cells ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). In addition, pretreatment with IMD-0354 significantly inhibited the clonogenicity of radioresistant HER2 -overexpressing MDA+FIR cell lines C4 and C5 but did not affect survival of the relatively radiosensitive C2 cells ( Fig. 5C–E ). To inhibit NF-?B directly, we designed and tested a human p65 siRNA that effectively blocked its target p65 as well as HER2 expression in the C2 and C5 MDA+FIR cells ( Fig. 5F ). p65 siRNA-mediated HER2 inhibition significantly radiosensitized the C4 cells with high HER2 expression ( Fig. 5G ) and, in contrast, did not affect the radiosensitivity of the relatively radiosensitive C2 cells with low HER2 expression ( Fig. 5H ). These results demonstrate that NF-?B is a potential therapeutic target for radiosensitization of HER2 -overexpressing breast cancer cells. Radiosensitization by HER2 siRNA To further explore the radiosensitization induced by inhibiting the NF-?B/HER2 pathway, we determined whether direct inhibition of HER2 overexpression by siRNA can sensitize the radioresistant MDA+FIR cells. We first tested and confirmed the efficiency of a HER2 siRNA fragment in breast cancer SKBr3 cells that showed a high endogenous HER2 expression level (data not shown). A similar efficiency of HER2 inhibition was detected in MCF+FIR and MCF-7/ HER2 cells treated with 20 n M of HER2 siRNA for 60 h ( Fig. 6A ). Radiosensitivity (as determined by clonogenic survival) was enhanced by siRNA-mediated HER2 inhibition in both MCF-7/ HER2 ( Fig. 6B ) and MCF+FIR cells ( Fig. 6C ). Treatment with 20 n M of HER2 siRNA for 60 h inhibited the HER2 overexpression in the radioresistant cell lines C4 and C5 but not in the relatively radiosensitive cell line C2 ( Fig. 6D ). However, the radiosensitization was much greater in the radioresistant HER2 -overexpressing cell lines C4 and C5 compared to the HER2 -low-expressing C2 cells (which showed almost no sensitization) and the heterogeneous MCF+FIR cells (which showed very limited radiosensitization) ( Fig. 6E–G ). Thus targeting HER2 may be an effective mechanism to resensitize radioresistant breast cancer cells expressing high levels of HER2 .  RESULTS HER2 Expression in Irradiated Cells and in Recurrent Invasive Breast Cancers Figure 1A–C shows that HER2 transactivation detected by mRNA levels was enhanced in breast cancer MCF-7 ( Fig. 1A ) and MDA-MB-231 ( Fig. 1B ) cells 24 h after exposure to a single dose of 5 Gy. The MCF-7/ HER2 transfectants that were induced to overexpress HER2 by stable gene transfection ( 24 ) did not show a similar endogenous HER2 gene activation ( Fig. 1C ), indicating that breast cancer cells low in or lacking HER2 expression are sensitive to radiation-mediated HER2 gene activation. Consistent with this result, 5 Gy of ? rays significantly induced HER2 protein levels in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, which normally express low levels of HER2, but not in the positive control MCF-7/ HER2 cells exposed to radiation ( Fig. 1D ). In addition, compared to the wild type MCF-7 cells, the MCF+FIR cells (MCF-7 cells surviving a long-term fractionated irradiation) ( 21 ) showed increased HER2 protein levels ( Fig. 1E ) that was similar to that of MCF-7/ HER2 cells. HER2 induction was further confirmed in in vivo irradiated mouse xenograft tumors of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with radiation (3 × 2 Gy ? rays separated by 24 h). Immunohistochemistry ( Fig. 1F ; Supplementary Fig. S1 ) and Western blotting ( Fig. 1G ) analysis of HER2 revealed an obvious HER2 induction in irradiated tumors compared to the sham-irradiated control tumor. We then studied HER2 expression rate in primary (102 cases) and recurrent invasive (78 cases) tumors from a group of clinically diagnosed breast cancer patients (total cases 180). As shown in Fig. 1H , HER2-postive tumors detected by immunohistochemistry were detected more frequently in the recurrent tumors (59%, 46/78) than in the primary (41%, 42/102) breast cancers. There was no difference in HER2 gene amplification in primary (33%, 48/144) and recurrent (34%, 23/67) tumors detected by the standard FISH analysis that is based on the HER2 gene copy numbers. Collectively, these results suggest that HER2 overexpression is linked with adaptive tumor resistance. Radiation Enhanced the Recruitment of NF-?B to HER2 Promoter NF-?B plays a central role in radiation resistance ( 28 , 29 ). To determine whether radiation-induced NF-?B regulates HER2 expression, we analyzed the HER2 promoter region by searching the Transcription Element Search System (TESS) database. The NF-?B binding site (gggacgaccc; ?364 to ?355) was found in the human HER2 promoter region ( 30 ). We then designed two fragments of HER2 promoter for ChIP analysis (A and B in Fig. 2A ). Fragment A was from ?494 to ?200 encompassing the NF-?B binding site (?364 to ?355), and fragment B was located 1.4 kb upward of A without NF-?B binding site as a negative control. The ChIP results ( Fig. 2B ) revealed that p65 and p50, which form the major NF-?B complex, were detected in fragment A but not fragment B of the HER2 promoter. The other NF-?B subunits p52 and c-Rel were negligible in the remainder of the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The recruitment of p65 and p50 but not p52 and c-Rel to the HER2 promoter was significantly enhanced 16 h after exposure to 5 Gy. In contrast to another NF-?B-regulated promoter, radiation enhanced the recruitment of all the NF-?B subunits to I ? B ? promoter, a known NF-?B target gene ( 31 ). These results suggest that the p65/p50 complex of NF-?B ( 32 ) is specifically involved in radiation-induced HER2 overexpression. Recruitment of p65/p50 to the HER2 promoter was also confirmed in MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors irradiated in vivo using the I ? B ? promoter as the positive control ( Fig. 2C ). Figure 2D shows that inhibition of NF-?B by transfection of mutant I ? B ? (m I ? B ?) or treatment with IMD-0354 (2 µ M , 5 h), a selective IKK? inhibitor ( 27 ), dramatically reduced radiation-induced recruitment of p65/p50 to the promoters of HER2 and the control I ? B ?. Figure 2E shows the estimated values of reduced NF-?B binding to the promoters of HER2 and I ? B ?. Thus the NF-?B p65/p50 complex is specifically required for radiation-induced HER2 transactivation. NF-?B Activation is Required for Radiation-Induced HER2 Overexpression MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with NF-?B luciferase reporters were treated with 2 µ M IMD-0354 for 5 h before irradiation with 5 Gy.

Compared to wild-type HER2 promoter activity, radiation-induced luciferase activity of pGL2-enhancer- HER2 -?NF-?B (with a deleted NF-?B binding site) was absent ( Fig. 3B ). Figure 3C shows that IMD-0354 reduced both basal and radiation-induced HER2 promoter activity, and, consistent with the inhibited reporter activity, HER2 expression was reduced by IMD-0354 ( Fig. 3D ). NF-?B inhibition by p65 siRNA (20–40 n M ) significantly blocked p65 expression ( Fig. 3E ), and in turn, p65 siRNA effectively inhibited radiation-induced HER2 promoter transactivation ( Fig. 3F ). Inhibition of NF-?B by mutant m I ? B transfection also reduced radiation-induced HER2 protein expression ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ).

In addition, pretreatment with IMD-0354 significantly inhibited the clonogenicity of radioresistant HER2 -overexpressing MDA+FIR cell lines C4 and C5 but did not affect survival of the relatively radiosensitive C2 cells ( Fig. 5C–E ).

A similar efficiency of HER2 inhibition was detected in MCF+FIR and MCF-7/ HER2 cells treated with 20 n M of HER2 siRNA for 60 h ( Fig. 6A ). Radiosensitivity (as determined by clonogenic survival) was enhanced by siRNA-mediated HER2 inhibition in both MCF-7/ HER2 ( Fig. 6B ) and MCF+FIR cells ( Fig. 6C ). Treatment with 20 n M of HER2 siRNA for 60 h inhibited the HER2 overexpression in the radioresistant cell lines C4 and C5 but not in the relatively radiosensitive cell line C2 ( Fig. 6D ). However, the radiosensitization was much greater in the radioresistant HER2 -overexpressing cell lines C4 and C5 compared to the HER2 -low-expressing C2 cells (which showed almost no sensitization) and the heterogeneous MCF+FIR cells (which showed very limited radiosensitization) ( Fig. 6E–G ). Thus targeting HER2 may be an effective mechanism to resensitize radioresistant breast cancer cells expressing high levels of HER2 .  HER2 Expression in Irradiated Cells and in Recurrent Invasive Breast Cancers Figure 1A–C shows that HER2 transactivation detected by mRNA levels was enhanced in breast cancer MCF-7 ( Fig. 1A ) and MDA-MB-231 ( Fig. 1B ) cells 24 h after exposure to a single dose of 5 Gy.

NF-?B-Mediated HER2 Overexpression is Linked to Radioresistance Tumor repopulation after fractionated irradiation has been linked to the failure of treatment by radiotherapy ( 1 ) due to the heterogeneous radiosensitivity among cancer cells ( 33 ). To determine whether HER2 overexpression is associated with the radioresistance in the heterogeneous cell population, we tested HER2 expression in a breast cancer cell population (MDA+FIR) derived from MDA-MB-231 cells after long-term fractionated ?-ray treatments (1 Gy/day for 30 fractions, total dose 30 Gy). A striking difference in HER2 expression levels was detected among the cloned cell lines isolated from the MDA+FIR cell population (C1, C2, C4, C5, C9 and C13) ( Fig. 4A ). Both the basal and radiation-induced NF-?B activities were elevated predominantly in the cell lines with higher HER2 expression ( Fig. 4B ). Furthermore, an enhanced clonogenic survival of the cloned cell line was tightly correlated to NF-?B activity and HER2 protein levels ( Fig. 4C ). The dose-modifying factor (DMF) at 10% isosurvival was 1.0 for C13, 1.1 for C2, 1.3 for C1 and C9, and 1.7 for C4 and C5, which was significantly increased with the activation of the NF-?B/HER2 pathway. Two of six MDA+FIR cell lines (C2 and C13) showed no induction of HER2 expression and demonstrated similar radiosensitivity to the sham-irradiated parental MDA-MB-231 cells as measured by clonogenic survival.

IMD-0354 efficiently reduced the overexpression of HER2 in the radioresistant cell lines C4 and C5 but not the radiosensitive C2 cells ( Fig. 5B ). Consistent with the HER2 reduction, IMD-0354 reduced the clonogenicity of MCF+FIR but not MCF-7/ HER2 cells ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). In addition, pretreatment with IMD-0354 significantly inhibited the clonogenicity of radioresistant HER2 -overexpressing MDA+FIR cell lines C4 and C5 but did not affect survival of the relatively radiosensitive C2 cells ( Fig. 5C–E ). To inhibit NF-?B directly, we designed and tested a human p65 siRNA that effectively blocked its target p65 as well as HER2 expression in the C2 and C5 MDA+FIR cells ( Fig. 5F ). p65 siRNA-mediated HER2 inhibition significantly radiosensitized the C4 cells with high HER2 expression ( Fig. 5G ) and, in contrast, did not affect the radiosensitivity of the relatively radiosensitive C2 cells with low HER2 expression ( Fig. 5H ). These results demonstrate that NF-?B is a potential therapeutic target for radiosensitization of HER2 -overexpressing breast cancer cells.  Radiosensitization by NF-?B/HER2 Inhibition IMD-0354 inhibited the expression of HER2 in MCF+FIR cells, but relatively less inhibition was observed in MCF-7/ HER2 cells ( Fig. 5A ), confirming that the radiation-induced endogenous HER2 expression was controlled by NF-?B. IMD-0354 efficiently reduced the overexpression of HER2 in the radioresistant cell lines C4 and C5 but not the radiosensitive C2 cells ( Fig. 5B ). Consistent with the HER2 reduction, IMD-0354 reduced the clonogenicity of MCF+FIR but not MCF-7/ HER2 cells ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). In addition, pretreatment with IMD-0354 significantly inhibited the clonogenicity of radioresistant HER2 -overexpressing MDA+FIR cell lines C4 and C5 but did not affect survival of the relatively radiosensitive C2 cells ( Fig. 5C–E ). To inhibit NF-?B directly, we designed and tested a human p65 siRNA that effectively blocked its target p65 as well as HER2 expression in the C2 and C5 MDA+FIR cells ( Fig. 5F ). p65 siRNA-mediated HER2 inhibition significantly radiosensitized the C4 cells with high HER2 expression ( Fig. 5G ) and, in contrast, did not affect the radiosensitivity of the relatively radiosensitive C2 cells with low HER2 expression ( Fig. 5H ). These results demonstrate that NF-?B is a potential therapeutic target for radiosensitization of HER2 -overexpressing breast cancer cells.  Radiosensitization by HER2 siRNA To further explore the radiosensitization induced by inhibiting the NF-?B/HER2 pathway, we determined whether direct inhibition of HER2 overexpression by siRNA can sensitize the radioresistant MDA+FIR cells. We first tested and confirmed the efficiency of a HER2 siRNA fragment in breast cancer SKBr3 cells that showed a high endogenous HER2 expression level (data not shown). A similar efficiency of HER2 inhibition was detected in MCF+FIR and MCF-7/ HER2 cells treated with 20 n M of HER2 siRNA for 60 h ( Fig. 6A ). Radiosensitivity (as determined by clonogenic survival) was enhanced by siRNA-mediated HER2 inhibition in both MCF-7/ HER2 ( Fig. 6B ) and MCF+FIR cells ( Fig. 6C ). Treatment with 20 n M of HER2 siRNA for 60 h inhibited the HER2 overexpression in the radioresistant cell lines C4 and C5 but not in the relatively radiosensitive cell line C2 ( Fig. 6D ). However, the radiosensitization was much greater in the radioresistant HER2 -overexpressing cell lines C4 and C5 compared to the HER2 -low-expressing C2 cells (which showed almost no sensitization) and the heterogeneous MCF+FIR cells (which showed very limited radiosensitization) ( Fig. 6E–G ). Thus targeting HER2 may be an effective mechanism to resensitize radioresistant breast cancer cells expressing high levels of HER2 .  Radiosensitization by HER2 siRNA To further explore the radiosensitization induced by inhibiting the NF-?B/HER2 pathway, we determined whether direct inhibition of HER2 overexpression by siRNA can sensitize the radioresistant MDA+FIR cells. We first tested and confirmed the efficiency of a HER2 siRNA fragment in breast cancer SKBr3 cells that showed a high endogenous HER2 expression level (data not shown). A similar efficiency of HER2 inhibition was detected in MCF+FIR and MCF-7/ HER2 cells treated with 20 n M of HER2 siRNA for 60 h ( Fig. 6A ). Radiosensitivity (as determined by clonogenic survival) was enhanced by siRNA-mediated HER2 inhibition in both MCF-7/ HER2 ( Fig. 6B ) and MCF+FIR cells ( Fig. 6C ). Treatment with 20 n M of HER2 siRNA for 60 h inhibited the HER2 overexpression in the radioresistant cell lines C4 and C5 but not in the relatively radiosensitive cell line C2 ( Fig. 6D ). However, the radiosensitization was much greater in the radioresistant HER2 -overexpressing cell lines C4 and C5 compared to the HER2 -low-expressing C2 cells (which showed almost no sensitization) and the heterogeneous MCF+FIR cells (which showed very limited radiosensitization) ( Fig. 6E–G ). Thus targeting HER2 may be an effective mechanism to resensitize radioresistant breast cancer cells expressing high levels of HER2 .  DISCUSSION Consistent with the data reported previously on adaptive radioresistance ( 33 ), Fig. 4 shows a heterogeneous radioresistant population in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that survived fractionated doses of radiation. These results support the concept that tumor radiation response is linked with a specific subpopulation of cells, perhaps having the phenotype of cancer stem cells ( 44 ). Tumor repopulation has been linked with adaptive resistance ( 1 ), and HER2-positive breast cancer patients show a higher rate of recurrence after combined treatment with surgery and radiation ( 34 ). Our present data raise a critical concern about adaptive radioresistance in breast cancer patients who receive radiotherapy treatments to reduce the risk of local recurrence after conservative surgery ( 35 ). Our biopsy data ( Fig. 1H ) suggest that HER2-positive breast cancer cells are detected more frequently in breast cancer patients with recurrent invasive tumors than in the primary tumors. Interestingly, the incidence of the HER2 gene amplification detected by FISH does not show any difference when recurrent invasive tumors are compared with primary tumors ( Fig. 1H ). These results suggest that HER2 gene copy number may not be a critical factor contributing to recurrence and metastases. In contrast, the enhanced HER2 protein levels detected by immunohistochemistry analysis suggest that HER2 transcriptional activation may be a key factor in the development of HER2-mediated resistance to therapy and recurrence. Thus we speculate that HER2 gene transactivation rather than HER2 gene copy number is related to tumor heterogeneity or the radioresistant phenotype of stem/progenitor cells. Breast cancer cells expressing the CSC marker CD44 (CD44+) but not CD24 (CD24?/low) are more tumorigenic ( 36 ); this is further supported by recent data indicating that CSCs are linked with treatment failure and tumor recurrence ( 37 , 38 ). Bao et al. reported that glioma stem cells are able to promote radioresistance by enhancing DNA damage repair ( 39 ) and Phillips et al. indicated that CD44+/CD24?/low cancer-initiating cells are more radioresistant ( 40 ). These new findings shed light on the conceptual paradigm of how cancer stem cells or cancer-initiating cells contribute to acquired radioresistance. Further clinical study is warranted to confirm the radioresistant phenotype and CSC-mediated tumor repopulation. It is well known that HER2 overexpression is associated with aggressive tumor growth and poor prognosis of breast cancer ( 41 ). The present study on irradiated breast cancer cells and tumor xenografts as well as biopsy tissues from recurrent breast cancers reveals that NF-?B-mediated HER2 overexpression may play an essential role in the development of adaptive radioresistance and recurrence. Our results suggest that HER2 is a DNA-damage effector gene that plays a role in the pro-survival signaling network. Interestingly, NF-?B-mediated HER2 overexpression was found to be tightly correlated with the survival of heterogeneous cell lines subjected to long-term fractionated radiation treatment ( Fig. 4 ). The heterogeneous radioresistance in the MDA+FIR cell population established in this study demonstrates new evidence of tumor repopulation during and/or after radiation treatment. Our data imply that NF-?B-mediated HER2 overexpression may increase the chance for breast cancer cells to escape the lethal effect of fractionated doses of radiation. In addition, the striking heterogeneity observed in the surviving MDA-MB-231 populations may suggest the following two possibilities: (1) Radiation induces genomic instability that specifically activates the NF-?B/HER2 pathway to enhance cell survival; (2) radiation selects the radioresistant stem/progenitor cells with a high background NF-?B/HER2 activity, causing radiation-induced tumor repopulation due to enhanced overall clonogenic survival. Either way, the NF-?B/HER2 activity-mediated advantage in cell survival should be the focus of further investigation. A recent clinical report suggests that radiotherapy during breast maturation (such as radiotherapy for Hodgkin’s lymphoma or other pediatric solid tumors) can be a risk factor for the development of HER2-positive breast carcinomas ( 42 ). Our observations after in vivo irradiation of breast cancer cells provide the evidence that HER2 overexpression can be induced in HER2-low or -absent breast cancer cells through radiation-induced NF-?B activation. Cao et al. showed that I?B? is required for HER2 gene activation in carcinogen-induced tumor formation ( 43 ), supporting our observation that NF-?B plays a key role in HER2 overexpression. Two distinct NF-?B signaling pathways have been suggested in response to different cytotoxic stimuli ( 32 ), i.e., the classical pathway mediated mainly by the p65/p50 dimer and the alternative pathway mediated mainly by the RelB/p52 dimer ( 44 ). Using the ChIP assay, we demonstrated that NF-?B-mediated HER2 gene transactivation occurs through the classical pathway, since p65/p50 but not other NF-?B subunits are required for HER2 promoter activation ( Fig. 2B ). Based on these observations, it appears that the p65/p50 complex-mediated HER2 transactivation may provide potential therapeutic targets to sensitize HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Another important implication of the current results is the loop-like activation pathway of NF-?B/HER2 signaling in breast cancer radioresistance. We have reported that NF-?B activity is increased in MCF-7 cells after long-term radiation treatment ( 45 ) and that forced overexpression of HER2 enhances the radiation-induced NF-?B activity, which in turn promotes radioresistance by activating a series of pro-survival genes ( 24 ). It is well documented that NF-?B is activated by radiation ( 46 , 47 ), and NF-?B is now shown to bind directly to the HER2 promoter, resulting in HER2 overexpression and tumor adaptive radioresistance. In addition, we and others have reported that HER2 is able to activate the basal and radiation-induced NF-?B activity through the activation of PI3K/Akt ( 24 , 48 ), which further induces HER2 overexpression. This feed-forward loop-like HER2-NF-?B-HER2 pathway may be specifically activated in long-term radiation-treated radioresistant breast cancer cells or breast CSCs to cause adaptive tumor resistance. A schematic presentation of the HER2-NF-?B-HER2 loop in adaptive radioresistance is proposed in Fig. 6H . We speculate that activation of this pathway results in the failure of DNA-damaging anti-cancer modalities against HER2- negative tumors. In summary, we report here a novel finding that breast cancer cells lacking or with low HER2 expression may become resistant to therapy due to enhanced HER2 gene expression. HER2 is induced by exposure to radiation through NF-?B-mediated gene activation, and NF-?B-mediated HER2 overexpression is tightly associated with enhanced clonogenic survival and tumor repopulation. Our results suggest that breast cancer cure rates may be enhanced by targeting the NF-?B/HER2 pathway of radiation-resistant recurrent tumors.
