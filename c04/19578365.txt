Loci at 9p21 and 22q13 harbour alleles for development of cutaneous nevi and melanoma High number of melanocytic nevi is the most important known risk factor for cutaneous melanoma. We conducted a genome-wide association study for nevus count using 297,108 tag-SNPs in 1,524 twins and validated our results in an independent cohort of 4,107 subjects. We identified strongly associated variants in MTAP , a gene adjacent to the familial melanoma susceptibility locus CDKN2A on 9p21 (rs4636294, P = 3.4 × 10-15). We further identified PLA2G6 on 22q13.1 (rs2284063, P = 3.4 × 10-8). Both loci were also associated with melanoma risk in 3,131 melanoma cases from two independent studies (odds-ratios 1.23 at rs10757257 and rs132985). About one subject in 11 is homozygous for the variant at both loci with twice the number of nevi compared to those homozygous for the protective alleles, and double the risk for melanoma. These data provide the first evidence for common melanoma alleles whose effects are mediated through nevus number.  Methods Subjects and phenotypes TwinsUK The St. Thomas' U.K. adult twin registry (TwinsUK) cohort is unselected for any disease and is representative of the general UK population. Nevus counts were collected at St Thomas Hospital in London and the study was approved by the St Thomas' Hospital Research Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from every participant to the study. Examination was performed by trained research nurses following a standardized and reproducible nevus count protocol [ 22 ]. The total body nevus count (excluding the genital area, breasts, and posterior scalp) was defined as the sum of all nevi >2 mm in diameter. Genotypic data were available for 1,524 subjects: 206 singletons, 832 dizygous (DZ) and 486 monozygous (MZ) twins. The median (1st - 3rd) age was 47 (37 – 54). The median (1st - 3rd) number of nevi was 21 (8 – 47). BTNS and Q-MEGA The Brisbane Twin Nevus Study (BTNS) is described in detail elsewhere [ 23 ] and comprised 4,107 adolescent twins, their siblings and parents (1,148 nuclear families) which have been recruited over sixteen years into an ongoing study of genetic and environmental factors contributing to the development of nevi and other risk factors for skin cancer. The twins are recruited at age twelve years via schools around Brisbane, Australia, and followed up at age fourteen. All controls are screened to be unaffected by cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). The sample is overwhelmingly (>95%) of northern European origin (mainly Anglo-Celtic). Total body nevus counting has been performed on the adolescent twins and singleton siblings on two occasions by a trained nurse (at ages 12 and 14). There were 1,979 twins and singleton siblings where nevus counts and genotypes were available. Of the parents of the twins, 1,470 had self-reported nevus score and genotypes available. The Australian melanoma cases (Q-MEGA) were a stratified sample of 1,734 subjects including all cases of melanoma diagnosed in the state of Queensland in the period 1982-1990, as described in detail elsewhere [ 24 ]. These individuals were originally studied between 1991-1994, but were recontacted and interviewed in 2002-2004. Controls for the present analysis come from the parents of the BTNS families. An additional 658 individuals were genotyped and contributed as controls for the melanoma case-control analysis. All cases and controls gave informed consent to participation in this study, and the study protocol was approved by appropriate institutional review boards. Leeds Case-Control Study 1,274 population based incident melanoma cases were recruited in a geographically defined area of Yorkshire and the Northern region of the UK. Overall, the study had a 63% response rate. Patients were diagnosed between September 2000 and December 2006. Cases were identified by clinicians, pathology registers and via the Northern and Yorkshire Cancer Registry and Information Service cancer registry to ensure overall ascertainment. For the first three years of the study all patients with invasive melanoma were invited to participate while subsequently only patients with Breslow thickness of at least 0.75 mm were invited as cases. The case series was supplemented by 123 melanoma cases with a family history of melanoma (at most two affected relatives) who were known to be negative for a CDKN2A mutation. CDKN2A is the most common gene mutated in the germline of multicase melanoma families; such mutations are infrequent in 3 case families in the UK being found in an estimated 21% of families (data not shown). Controls were ascertained by contacting general practitioners to identify eligible individuals. These controls were frequency matched with cases for age and sex from general practitioners who had also had cases as part of their patient register. Overall there was a 55% response rate among controls (496 subjects). Additional controls were supplemented by a population-based group of 574 women who following informed consent agreed to participate in a study involving recording their history of sun exposure and sun bathing including sun bed usage and for whom various measures of skin aging were recorded. DNA samples were also provided. All participating individuals gave written informed consent and regional ethical committee approval was obtained. The first 903 cases and all the controls were asked about UV exposure and other aspects of lifestyle and provided detailed information on the history of residency. A trained nurse interviewed all cases and controls and formed a standardised examination for skin nevi. Nevi were examined by body sector; nevi greater than 2 mm in diameter were counted. Genotyping The TwinsUk sample has been genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap 300k duo chip, and population substructure has been detected and removed as described previously [ 25 ]. The SNPs rs751173, rs4636294, rs2218220, rs1335510, rs1341866, rs10757257, rs7023329, and rs10811629 for MTAP and rs2284063, rs6001027, rs132985, and rs738322 for PLA2G6 were genotyped both in the Australian BTNS and Q-MEGA samples in multiplex assays designed using the Sequenom MassARRAY Assay Design software (version 3.0). SNPs were typed using Sequenom iPLEX™ chemistry on a MALDI-TOF Compact Mass Spectrometer (Sequenom Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). The 2.5?L PCR reactions were performed in standard 384-well plates using 12.5 ng genomic DNA, 0.8 unit of Taq polymerase (HotStarTaq, Qiagen, Valencia, CA), 500 ?mol of each dNTP, 1.625mM of MgCl2, and 100 nmol of each PCRprimers (Bioneer, Korea). Standard PCR thermal cycling conditions and post-PCR extension reactions were carried out as described previously [ 26 ]. The iPLEX reaction products were desalted by diluting samples with 15?l of water and adding 3?l of resin. The products were spotted on a SpectroChip (Sequenom Inc, San Diego, CA, USA), and data were processed and analysed by MassARRAY TYPER 3.4 software (Sequenom Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). None of SNPs exhibited Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium, and there were no effects of ethnicity in both the control and case groups. For the Leeds sample, genotyping data from the Illumina HumanHap300 v2 array were available for the 123 familial cases and for 148 cases and 167 controls (Leeds1 sample). The SNPs rs4636294, rs2218220, and rs7023329 for MTAP and rs2284063 and rs6001027 for PLA2G6 were genotyped in further 1,126 cases and 574 controls from the Leeds case-control study by Taqman with overall call rate greater then 97%. The Leeds1 sample plus the additional genotypes were part of the Leeds2 sample. None of SNPs exhibited deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Participants in the study were all of UK ancestry and principal component analysis (PCA) involving a subset of the samples included in this analysis found no evidence of population stratification. Both Leeds1 and Leeds2 case-control sample were supplemented with genotyping information from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) 1958 birth cohort control samples analysed on the Illumina 550k array. While data on 1,447 controls are provided by the WTCCC, these controls were reduced to 1,395 because of low call rate (call rate < 97%, n = 51) and for apparent non-European ancestry on the basis of PCA (n=1). Statistical analyses Power analysis for the TwinsUK discovery sample was performed using the Genetic Power Calculator. Assuming that the tested SNP is a good proxy for an untyped functional variant we have 70% to 90% power of identifying a QTN responsible for 1% to 2% of the total genetic variance showing a P value required for a significant result after Bonferroni correction (P = 0.05/297,108 = 1.68 × 10-7). The GWA was performed in the TwinsUK sample using a rapid variance component association test implemented in MERLIN software version 1.1.2 [ 27 ] on the natural log transformed nevus counts and including age in the model. The method estimates the additive effect of each SNP by fitting a simple regression model to the trait while using a variance component approach to model the correlation between different observed phenotypes within pairs. A quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot was generated using R and visually inspected to detect strong inflation of the test statistics. The genomic inflation factor was calculated as the ratio of the median of the empirically observed distribution of the test statistic to the expected median to quantify the excess false positive rate [ 28 ] and was found to be 1.006, close to its expected value of 1.0. Simulation analysis by gene dropping was carried out with MERLIN in the TwinsUK sample to assess the empirical P values for the most significant SNPs on chromosome 9 (rs10757257) and 22 (rs132985). By using 1 × 10-6 simulations we observed a single P value of the same magnitude as what observed using the real data for rs10757257 (empirical P value 2 × 10-6), and none for rs132985 (empirical P value 1 × 10-6). Replication in the BTNS has been carried out using MENDEL [ 29 ], following cube-root transformation of the counts, and including age, age2, year studied, body surface area, estimated cumulative UV exposure, ancestry, hair and skin colour as covariates. For the Australian data cube-root transformation was significantly better than log transformation based on the Box-Cox analysis, and it closely matched the results of a negative binomial generalized linear mixed model analyses of the BTNS data, which also improved significantly in terms of model fit diagnostics. Empirical P values were evaluated through straight regression of log(nevus count) versus allele count using MENDEL for gene dropping of the most significant SNPs on chromosomes 9 and 22. By using 1 × 10-6 iterations we obtained empirical P values of 1 × 10-6 for rs4636294 and 3.6 × 10-3 for rs2284063. Combined P values from the BTNS and the TwinsUK studies were obtained using METAL. A z statistic is calculated for each marker using the P value and direction of the effect observed in each study. The combined P value is evaluated from the overall z statistic weighting each study proportionally to the square root of the number of subjects. The graphs on Figure 2 were generated by adapting a freely available R script [ 30 ]. Given that some cases and all the controls have some relatives in the analysis, the case-control analysis in the Q-MEGA sample was carried out using MENDEL penetrance analysis option, and also the Sib-pair program. The latter was used to calculate simulation-based P values allowing for residual familial resemblance. We selected cases and controls where all four grandparents were reported to be of Northern European ancestry and we also performed quantitative trait TDT analysis of nevus count, confirming that the observed associations were not due to population stratification. For the Leeds analysis, case-control comparisons by SNP for melanoma were made by unconditional logistic regression. Analyses including nevus count involved age and sex adjusted nevus count. Tests of nevus count by SNP genotype were based on a test of linear trend of age and sex adjusted nevus count. Meta-analysis for the melanoma case control association results was performed using the rmeta package of R. To refine the location of chromosomes 9 and 22 association signals and help the identification of some causal variants we imputed genotypes from the HapMap in the TwinsUK sample, as described previously [ 31 ]. An additional 665 and 309 SNPs in the 9p21 and 22q13 regions respectively were tested for association with nevus count.
