GYNECOLOGIC ISSUES IN THE HIV-INFECTED WOMAN With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), women living with HIV can now enjoy longer lifespans in relative good health as well as the prospect of bearing children with an overwhelmingly low risk of vertical transmission. Thus, increasingly, seropositive women are now facing issues around longevity as well as those associated with fertility. The clinician caring for the HIV-infected woman must be alert to the gynecologic issues that are prevalent in this population. Among those faced by the gynecologist are menstrual abnormalities, lower genital tract neoplasia, sexually transmitted infections, the need for gynecologic surgery, and menopausal issues including osteopenia/osteoporosis. Contraception in HIV seropositive women presents unique management issues, because of the necessity for a dual role of prevention of both pregnancy and HIV transmission, the possible effect of birth control on HIV infection, and the interaction between birth control and HIV therapies. With ever increasing frequency, the gynecologist will be presented with the seropositive woman or couple who wishes to conceive. The purpose of this chapter is to review the current knowledge on the relationship between HIV infection and menstrual abnormalities, genital neoplasias, contraceptive options, surgical complications, and menopause with its associated disorders. Special considerations in the seropositive woman contemplating pregnancy will also be discussed. The treatment of pelvic infections is discussed elsewhere in this volume, and only changes in standard therapy because of concurrent HIV-infection will be discussed here.  Conclusion We have made great strides in understanding the management of the many gynecologic conditions that affect HIV-positive women with an increased frequency. As the HIV-infected womanâ€™s life expectancy continues to lengthen, we will need new treatments for recurring conditions such as lower genital tract neoplasias. We have much to learn about the interaction between sex steroids, HIV-infection, and the immune system. As our knowledge grows, we will be better equipped to counsel women about contraceptive issues, the menopause and related issues, and pregnancy and infertility.
