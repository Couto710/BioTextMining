Breast Cancer Before Age 40 Years Approximately 7% of women with breast cancer are diagnosed before the age of 40 years, and this disease accounts for more than 40% of all cancer in women in this age group. Survival rates are worse when compared to those in older women, and multivariate analysis has shown younger age to be an independent predictor of adverse outcome. Inherited syndromes, specifically BRCA1 and BRCA2 , must be considered when developing treatment algorithms for younger women. Chemotherapy, endocrine, and local therapies have the potential to significantly impact both the physiologic health—including future fertility, premature menopause, and bone health—and the psychological health of young women as they face a diagnosis of breast cancer.  Conclusions Although thought to be a relatively uncommon condition, potentially one third of all breast cancers are diagnosed among premenopausal women. Breast cancers diagnosed at a younger age harbor aggressive clinicopathologic features and, more recently, have been recognized as a unique biologic entity. Special considerations, including infertility, pregnancy, bone health, genetic syndromes, and psychosocial issues must be addressed when developing treatment algorithms, including local therapies and adjuvant chemotherapeutic/endocrine strategies, among young women diagnosed with breast cancer. Finally, younger age at breast cancer diagnosis confers an inferior prognosis when compared to older women, illustrating the need for biologically driven clinical trials devoted specifically to the former population, with the overall goal of improving outcome.
