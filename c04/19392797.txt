TNF, LTA and TGFB1 genotype distributions among acute graft- vs -host disease subsets after HLA-matched unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a pilot study Cytokine single nucleotide polymorphisms and consequent production levels have been associated with acute graft- vs -host disease (aGVHD) development. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether polymorphisms in tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ), lymphotoxin alpha ( LTA ) and transforming growth factor beta 1 ( TGFB1 ) showed any association with aGVHD severity. Novel alleles and polymorphisms were identified for each cytokine locus. Genotype distributions were examined in 38 recipient–donor pairs (all chronic myelogenous leukemia in the first chronic phase) with either low-grade (grades 0–I) or high-grade (grades III–IV) aGVHD. Although no significant differences were found, some trends were noted in genotype distributions among aGVHD-grade groups. Power calculations determined that substantially more pairs would be required to show significant associations in distributions among aGVHD-grade groups.
