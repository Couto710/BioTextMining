A double TRPtych six views of TRP channels in disease and health At the 2008 Society for Neuroscience annual meeting a minisymposium entitled, “TRP channels contribute to disease processes” included talks from six heads of newlyestablished laboratories, each with a unique research focus, model system, and set of experimental tools. Among the questions addressed in these talks were: What is the role of TRP channels in pain perception? How do normally-functioning TRP channels contribute to cell death pathways? What are the characteristics of TRPpathies, disease states that result from over-active or under-active TRP channels? How are TRP channels regulated by signal transduction cascades? This review summarizes recent results from those laboratories and provides six perspectives on the subject of TRP channels and disease.  Deafness in <italic>varitint-waddler</italic> mutant mice results from constitutive activation of TRPML3 While no disease has yet been associated with TRPML3, the phenotype of mouse Trpml3 mutants suggest this gene should be considered a candidate locus in congenital diseases that include sensorineural hearing loss. Thus varitint-waddler ( Va ) mutant mice, which are deaf and have vestibular impairment, bear a semi-dominant mutation in the TRP channel-encoding gene Trpml3 ( Cloudman and Bunker, 1945 ; Deol, 1954 ; Cable and Steel, 1998 ; Di Palma et al., 2002 ). Varitint-waddler mice display several inner ear defects, including: (1) reduction or elimination of the endocochlear potential, (2) anatomical alteration of the stria vascularis, the cochlear structure that generates this potential, with its marginal cells rounding up and losing their cytoplasmic processes, (3) degeneration and loss of sensory hair cells, which display apical deformations at embryonic stages and are later extruded from the sensorineural epithelium ( Deol, 1954 ; Cable and Steel, 1998 ). The Va mutation results in an alanine-to-proline substitution at residue 419 (A419P) of TRPML3, and this is thought to break the alpha helix of the fifth transmembrane domain (S5), near the pore ( Di Palma et al., 2002 ; Grimm et al., 2007 ). How this form of TRPML3 contributes to cell death is unknown. Jaime García-Añoveros (Northwestern University) and his coworkers have been studying this issue. Is the effect of TRPML3 on cell viability cell autonomous? The García-Añoveros group demonstrated that many epithelial cells that line the cochlear scala media and the vestibular endolymphatic compartments of the inner ear express TRPML3 mRNA ( Nagata et al., 2008 ). These include the marginal cells of the stria vascularis and the equivalent dark cells of the vestibule, as well as the cochlear and vestibular mechanosensory hair cells, which degenerate in varitint-waddler mice. Further this group showed that when heterologously expressed in LLC-PK1-CL4 epithelial cells, which serve as a culture model for hair cells, a TRPML3::GFP fusion protein accumulated in lysosomal vacuoles as well as in espin-enlarged microvilli that resemble stereocilia ( Nagata et al., 2008 ). When these cells express the mutant TRPML3(A419P), they die and are extruded from the epithelium in a manner reminiscent of the degeneration of hair cells in Va mice ( Nagata et al., 2008 ). Together these finding suggest that hair cell death in varitint-waddler mice occurs because of cell autonomous expression of mutant TRPML3. What effect does the A419P mutation have on TRPML3 function? Like many other TRP channels, TRPML3 forms cation channels that normally open only in response to high positive potentials and display outer rectification. However, these channels can also open at negative potentials generating double rectification ( Kim et al., 2007 ; Nagata et al., 2008 ). TRPML3 channels have a preference for calcium over sodium and potassium, and are blocked by gadolinium and verapamil but not by ruthenium red, gentamycin or amiloride ( Xu et al., 2007 ; Nagata et al., 2008 ). They have permeabilities ranging from 50 pS (at negative potentials) to 70 pS (at positive potentials) ( Nagata et al., 2008 ). The A419P mutation does not affect either the conductance or permeability of the TRPML3 channel. Instead, this gain-of-function mutation greatly enhances the channel’s open probability at hyperpolarized potentials ( Nagata et al., 2008 ). The result of this hyperactivity is a large inwardly rectifying cationic current and severe cellular depolarization ( Grimm et al., 2007 ; Kim et al., 2007 ; Xu et al., 2007 ; Nagata et al., 2008 ). Of note, recent work from the Clapham laboratory indicates that the pale coat color of varitint-waddler mutants likely results from the death of melanoctyes ( Xu et al., 2007 ). In summary, these findings suggest constitutive activity of TRPML3 (A419P) channels at physiological potentials likely underlies the melanocyte cell loss, hair cell degeneration and deafness that characterize varitint-waddler mice.

In summary, these findings suggest constitutive activity of TRPML3 (A419P) channels at physiological potentials likely underlies the melanocyte cell loss, hair cell degeneration and deafness that characterize varitint-waddler mice.  TRPM7 prevents melanin-synthesis-dependent death of embryonic melanocytes TRPM7 seems a prime candidate to be a disease locus because it is required for viability of several cell types. Specifically, TRPM7 knockdown in B-cells, retinoblastoma, and smooth-muscle cell lines causes growth arrest and/or cell death ( Nadler et al., 2001 ; Hanano et al., 2004 ; He et al., 2005 ). Supporting an essential role for TRPM7 in normal development, trpm7 mutants have been isolated several times in phenotype-based mutagenesis screens in zebrafish. Two of these alleles have been molecularly characterized; both carry mutations that cause a frame shift in sequence encoding the intracellular carboxy terminus ( Elizondo et al., 2005 ). The phenotype of embryos homozygous for either of these alleles resembles that in embryos injected with trpm7 anti-sense oligonucleotides, implying that the alleles are hypomorphs (loss-of-function) ( Elizondo et al., 2005 ). Zebrafish embryos homozygous for mutant alleles of trpm7 display a range of phenotypes at various developmental stages. At embryonic stages trpm7 mutants are characterized by the death of embryonic melanocytes and a transient period of paralysis ( Kelsh et al., 1996 ; Arduini and Henion, 2004 ; Cornell et al., 2004 ); at larval stages and adult stages, they display dwarfism, abnormal skeletogenesis, and kidney stones ( Elizondo et al., 2005 ). Of note, knockdown of TRPM7 expression caused concomitant reduction of TRPM2 expression in cultured cortical neurons ( Aarts et al., 2003 ), it is an interesting and testable possibility that reduction of trpm2 expression occurs in zebrafish trpm7 mutants and contributes to phenotypes therein. Robert Cornell’s group (University of Iowa) has been investigating the mode of melanocyte cell death and the cellular underpinnings of paralysis in zebrafish trpm7 mutant embryos. Application of a broad-specificity caspase inhibitor, which prevents melanocyte cell death in zebrafish embryos mutant for the gene encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit, does not have this effect in trpm7 mutants, implying that melanocyte death in these mutants does not occur by apoptosis ( McNeill et al., 2007 ). By contrast, supplementing embryo medium with magnesium, but not calcium, rescued melanocyte cell death in trpm7 , but not kit , mutants. Interestingly, the inhibition of melanin synthesis via application of a tyrosinase inhibitor also served to prevent melanocyte cell death in trpm7 mutants ( McNeill et al., 2007 ). Combined with the fact that the intermediates of melanin synthesis are toxic reactive oxygen species, these findings imply that loss of Trpm7 leads to magnesium deficiency in melanophores, resulting in a buildup of toxic intermediates of melanin synthesis that induce necrotic cell death. Notably, the loss of TRPM7 and excess TRPML3 activity both result in the death of melanoctyes ( McNeill et al., 2007 ; Xu et al., 2007 ), possibly revealing a complex interaction between these channels. Paralysis in zebrafish trpm7 mutant embryos is intriguing because of the association of TRPM7 with a neurodegenerative disease in humans, however its cellular basis remains unknown. Thus, a hypomorphic variant of TRPM7, encoding a channel with increased propensity to close in response to intracellular magnesium, is associated with increased risk for the neurodegenerative disease lytico bodig , a disease with neurofibrillary tangles and features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinsonism ( Hermosura et al., 2005 ) (TRPM2 may also be associated with this disease, reviewed in Hermosura and Garruto, 2007 ). Dopaminergic neurons share similar metabolic chemistry with melanocytes, and the by-products of dopamine metabolism are also known to be toxic. Therefore, it is possible that like melanocytes, dopaminergic neurons require TRPM7 to prevent toxic build-up of dopamine metabolites. An alternative explanation for paralysis in TRPM7 mutants is abnormal cholinergic signaling at the neuromuscular junction or perhaps in the brain because cholinergic neurons in the sympathetic neurons require TRPM7 for normal synaptic transmission ( Krapivinsky et al., 2006 ; Brauchi et al., 2008 ). Further exploration of the cellular basis of paralysis in zebrafish trpm7 mutants may yield insight into the etiology of lytico bodig and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases.

Some TRP channels are regulated by G protein coupled receptors The accumulating evidence that TRP channels contribute to disease processes motivates an improved understanding of how TRP channels are regulated. The prototypical TRP channel, dTRP, mediates phototransduction in Drosophila , and similarly many vertebrate TRP channels are involved in sensory transduction. At least six TRP channels are directly gated by sensory stimuli, while others like dTRP are activated downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This latter class includes TRPC2, an ion channel expressed in the pheromone-sensing vomeronasal organ of mammals ( Liman et al., 1999 ; Stowers et al., 2002 ), TRPM5, an ion channel that is largely restricted to chemosensory cells ( Perez et al., 2002 ; Zhang et al., 2003 ), and TRPA1 and TRPV1, two ion channels that are involved in nociception ( Jordt et al., 2003 ; Dhaka et al., 2006 ). In nonsensory tissues, including muscle and brain, some TRP channels may, likewise, transduce the binding of neurotransmitters to GPCRs into electrical responses ( Clapham, 2003 ). The general model for understanding the GPCR-based mechanism of TRP channel activation is based on extensive work in the fly photoreceptor ( Hardie, 2007 ) ( Montell, 1999 ). A key component of this system is phospholipase C (PLC; NorpA), which is activated following absorption of light by rhodopsin, and is essential for phototransduction ( Bloomquist et al., 1988 ). PLC activation leads to the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol (4,5) bisphospate (PI(4,5)P2) into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3), as well as to the release of intracellular Ca2+ ( Berridge, 1993 ) — and any of these products might be the one that activates the Drosophila TRP channels. Several lines of evidence suggest that it is the lipid metabolites of DAG that activate the fly TRP channels and mediate phototransduction ( Chyb et al., 1999 ; Leung et al., 2008 ). Unfortunately, the failure of these compounds to activate native channels has impeded progress in confirming this possibility ( Hardie, 2007 ). Taste is an excellent system in which to study the regulation of TRP channels that lie downstream of GPCR signaling, as many of the molecular components of taste transduction have been identified, and the sensory stimuli are well characterized. Bitter is detected by a small family of GPCRs, while sweet and umami are each detected by a heterodimeric GPCR ( Chandrashekar et al., 2006 ). Receptors for bitter, sweet and umami tastes are coupled through trimeric G proteins to the enzyme PLCb2, whose activity is essential for taste transduction ( Zhang et al., 2003 ). Also essential is the ion channel TRPM5 ( Perez et al., 2002 ; Zhang et al., 2003 ; Clapp et al., 2006 ), as revealed by the near insensitivity of TRPM5 knockout mice to both bitter and sweet substances ( Zhang et al., 2003 ; Clapp et al., 2006 ). How, then, does PLC activation lead to a change in the gating of TRPM5 channels? In the laboratory of Emily Liman (University of Southern California), this question has been addressed by studying the responses of TRPM5 channels — in both cells expressing heterologous TRPM5 and taste cells expressing native TRPM5 — to putative second messengers. Initial studies by this group and others have shown that, when expressed heterologously, TRPM5 forms a nonselective cation channel that is activated by the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ ( Hofmann et al., 2003 ; Jordt et al., 2003 ; Prawitt et al., 2003 ), or by the depletion of Ca2+ stores ( Perez et al., 2002 ). More recently, the Liman group showed that intracellular Ca2+ released from IP3 stores gates TRPM5 in native taste receptor cells ( Zhang et al., 2007 ), and that following sustained activation, TRPM5 channels — in both native and heterologous cells — desensitize by a process that may be mediated be the depletion of PI(4,5)P2 ( Jordt et al., 2003 ). Together these data suggest a model for taste transduction whereby elevation of IP3 and the ensuing release of intracellular Ca2+ gates TRPM5, leading to membrane depolarization. Whereas this mechanism cannot explain phototransduction in Drosophila , where Ca2+ has no direct activating effect ( Ranganathan et al., 1994 ; Hardie, 1995 ) and the IP3 receptor is dispensable ( Acharya et al., 1997 ; Raghu et al., 2000 ), it may be applicable to other systems in which Ca2+-activated TRP channels participate.
