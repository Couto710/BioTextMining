Fetal Microchimerism and Cancer The persistence of fetal stem cells with multilineage potential in women who have been pregnant, a phenomenon known as fetal microchimerism, is emerging as a potential contributing factor in certain diseases including cancer. For example, fetal microchimerism has been implicated in autoimmune disease, wound healing, and cancer. Studies of this phenomenon may provide a novel perspective on cancer in women, including in breast, ovarian, and lung cancers.  Conclusion We are only beginning to understand the role that fetal microchimeric cells play in cancer. As is the case in their involvement in non-cancerous diseases where they sometimes fight the disease and other times contribute to the disease, these cells sometimes help to suppress tumor development by taking on an immunosurveillance role, and other times they may behave like cancer stem cells and contribute to the growth of tumors. Studies using mouse models to track fetal microchimeric cells in parous females will help us understand their innate potential for each of these diametrically opposed roles, thereby assessing their involvement in human cancers and allowing for the design of new therapeutic strategies based upon this understanding.  Figure Figure 1 A . Lungs of A/J female mouse 8 months after she had given birth following mating with a CAG/EGFP male, observed under fluorescent light. Fetally-derived GFP-expressing cells associated with a solid tumor are within the boxed area. Image of this tumor is enlarged in B . An apparent second lesion in a different lobe of the lung is indicated by the arrow. The arrowhead points to another lobe of the lung where fetally-derived cells are absent.
