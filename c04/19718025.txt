Analysis of the Tyrosine Kinome in Melanoma Reveals Recurrent Mutations in ERBB4 Tyrosine phosphorylation is important in signaling pathways underlying tumorigenesis. A mutational analysis of the Protein Tyrosine Kinase (PTK) gene family in cutaneous metastatic melanoma identified 30 somatic mutations in the kinase domain of 19 PTKs. The whole of the coding region of these 19 PTKs was further evaluated for somatic mutations in a total of 79 melanoma samples. This analysis revealed novel ERBB4 mutations in 19% of melanoma patients and that an additional two kinases ( FLT1 and PTK2B ) are mutated in 10% of melanomas. Seven missense mutations in the most commonly altered PTK ( ERBB4 ) were examined and found to increase kinase activity and transformation ability. Melanoma cells expressing mutant ERBB4 had reduced cell growth after shRNA–mediated knockdown of ERBB4 or treatment with the ERBB inhibitor lapatinib. These studies might lead to personalized therapeutics specifically targeting the kinases that are mutationally altered in individual melanomas.  Methods Tumor Tissues Tissue and melanoma cell lines used in this study were described previously 24 . PCR, sequencing and mutational analysis PCR and sequencing was done as previously described 24 . The kinase domain mutation screen was analyzed using Consed 25 . Variants were called using Polyphred 6.11 26 and DIP Detector (Hansen N., unpublished), an in del detector for improved sensitivity in finding insertions and deletions. Sequence traces of the secondary screen were analyzed using the Mutation Surveyor software package (SoftGenetics, State College, PA). Construction of wild-type and mutant ERBB4 expression vector Human ERBB4 (NM_005235) was cloned by PCR as previously described 24 using a clone (#8327667) purchased from Open Biosystems with primers in Supplemental Table 5 . The PCR product was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDF-MCS2-EF1-Puro™ (Systems Biosciences, Inc., Mountain View, CA) via the XbaI and NotI restriction sites. The E317K, E452K, E542K, R544W, E563K, K751M, E836K, E872K and non-targetable ERBB4 point mutants were made using Phusion PCR for site-directed mutagenesis. Cell culture and transient expression Metastatic melanoma tumor lines were maintained as previously described 27 . HEK 293T cells as well as NIH 3T3 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in complete Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1X non-essential amino acids, 2mM L-glutamine, and 0.75% sodium bicarbonate. HEK 293T cells were transfected with Lipfectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at a 6:1 ratio with DNA (?l:?g) using 3–5 ?g of plasmid DNA. Immunoprecipitation and western blotting Transfected cells were gently washed 3X in PBS and then lysed using 0.5–1.0 ml 1% NP-40 lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, Complete Protease Inhibitor tablet, EDTA-free (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 1?M sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, and 0.1% ?-mercaptoethanol) per T-75 flask for 20 minutes on ice. Lysed cells were scraped and transferred into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Extracts were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14,000 rpm at 4°C. 500 ?l of supernatant was immunoprecipitated overnight using 20 ?l of anti-ERBB4 agarose-conjugated beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The immunoprecipitates were washed and subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting as previously described 28 . Primary antibodies used in our analysis were anti-ERBB4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-P-ERBB4 (Y1162) (Abgent), anti-P-ERBB4 (Y1284) (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-PY20 (Zymed-Invitrogen), anti-P-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204), anti-ERK1/2, anti-P-AKT (S473), anti-AKT (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-P-STAT5A/B (Y694/Y699) (Upstate Biotech-Millipore), anti-STAT5 (Cell Signaling), and anti-?-tubulin (Calbiochem-EMD Biosciences, Gibbstown, NJ). Pooled stable expression To make lentivirus, ERBB4 constructs were co-transfected into HEK 293T cells seeded at 1.5×106 per T75 flask with pVSV-G and pFIV-34N (kind gifts from Todd Waldman, Georgetown University) helper plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 as described by the manufacturer. Virus-containing media was harvested 48–60hr after transfection, filtered, aliquoted and stored at ?80°C. SK-Mel-2 cells (National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Treatment, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Frederick, MD) were grown in RPMI-1640 (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) SK-Mel-2 and NIH 3T3 cells were seeded at 1.5 × 106 cells per T75 flask 24 hr prior to infection. Lentivirus for ERBB4 (WT, E317K, E452K, E542K, R544W, E563K, K751M, E836K, and E872K point mutants) and empty vector control were used to infect SK-Mel-2 cells or NIH 3T3 cells as previously described 29 . Stable expression of ERBB4 proteins (WT and mutants) was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by immunoblotting with anti-ERBB4 and anti-tubulin to show equivalent expression among pools. Lentiviral shRNA Constructs for stable depletion of ERBB4 were obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL) and three were confirmed to efficiently knockdown ERBB4 at the protein level. Lentiviral stocks were prepared as previously described 24 . Melanoma cell lines (2T, 7T, 17T, 31T, and 63T) were infected with shRNA lentiviruses for each condition (vector and scrambled controls and three independent ERBB4 -specific shRNAs). Selection and growth were done as described above. Stably infected pooled clones were tested in functional assays. To rescue shRNA-mediated knock-down of ERBB4 in melanoma cell lines the non-targetable ERBB4 lentivirus was made as described above and used to infect the melanoma cell line 17T. After infection, cells were given 48 to 72 hours to recover from infection prior to testing in functional assays. Proliferation and growth inhibition assays To examine growth potential, melanoma cell lines (2T, 7T, 17T, 31T, and 63T) stably infected with either vector or scrambled controls or ERBB4-specific shRNAs were seeded into 96 well plates at 2,500 cells per well and incubated for 13–17 days. Samples were analyzed every 48 hr by lysing cells in 50 ?l 0.2% SDS/well and incubating for 2 hour at 37°C prior to addition of 150 ?l/well of SYBR Green I solution (1:750 SYBR Green I (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) diluted in dH20). The effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on the proliferation of melanoma cell lines were tested by seeding 96-well plates at 5,000 cells/well in the presence or absence of serum containing media and incubated for 24 hr prior to addition of TKIs. Increasing concentrations of lapatinib (Tykerb-GlaxoSmithKline) were added to each well in four replicates with DMSO as negative control. Plates were analyzed 72 hr post-addition of TKIs using the SYBR Green I proliferation assay described above. To further test TKIs on melanoma cell lines we seeded 96-well plates at 5,000 cells per well and incubated 24 hr prior to addition of TKIs (e.g. lapatinib) at concentrations from 10 nM to 30 ?M. Once inhibitors were added, cells were incubated for 72 hr at 37°C. Cells were then analyzed as previously described 18 . Plates were read at 650nm on a Molecular Devices (Spectra Max) Plate Reader and analyzed using SoftMax v5 and GraphPad Prism v5. Soft agar assay SK-Mel-2 pooled ERBB4 clones were plated in duplicate at 1000 cells/well and NIH 3T3 pooled ERBB4 clones were plated in duplicate at 5000 cells/well in top plugs consisting of sterile 0.33% Bacto-Agar (BD, Sparks, MD) and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) in a 24-well plate. The lower plug contained sterile 0.5% Bacto-Agar and 10% fetal bovine serum. After two weeks, the colonies were photographed and counted. NIH 3T3 transformation assay 150 ng of each plasmid was transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method into NIH 3T3 cells cultured in 12 well plates. 24hr after transfection, 5% of transfected cells were seeded into T-25 flasks and cultured in normal growth medium for 10 days. The cells were stained with Hema3 (Sigma St. Louis, MO) and analyzed for the presence of foci. Analysis of ERBB4 kinase activity HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with ERBB4 (WT, E317K, E452K, E542K, R544W, E563K, E836K, E872K and kinase-dead (K751M)) or empty vector and incubated for 18–24 hr at 37°C in reduced (0.5%) serum containing medium prior to immunoprecipitation. Cells were harvested and ~3 mg of lysate were used in each immunoprecipitation reaction. Immunoprecipitates were performed as described above. Immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer followed by two washes in kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM MnCl2, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, and 1X complete protease inhibitor tablet). Immune complexes were then resuspended in 50?l kinase buffer and 10?l incubated in the presence of [?-32P]ATP (3?Ci per reaction) for 15 min at 37°C. Kinase reactions were stopped by the addition of 2X SDS sample buffer and phosphorylated samples were resolved on 8% Tris-Glycine gels. Gels were stained and destained prior to autoradiography. Immunoblot quantitation analysis Scanned films from western blot analysis of SDS-PAGE were analyzed using ImageJ (NIH software). Individual bands were quantitated and plots were generated to determine the intensities in each band. The data was then exported to Microsoft Excel and analyzed further for phospho:total ratios of protein. Flow cytometry analysis Melanoma cells were seeded into T-25 flasks at densities of 3×105 cells per flask in normal complete T2 medium and incubated at 37°C for 24 hr prior to addition of lapatinib. Lapatinib or vehicle was added 72 hr at a concentration of 5 ?M. Cells were then harvested for FACS analysis by first removing the medium into a new conical tube followed by trypsinizing of attached cells in T-25 flasks. Trypsinized cells and those from the medium were combined and washed in ice-cold PBS. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm at 4°C. Ice-cold 70% ethanol was added to cell pellets and allowed to fix overnight at 4°C followed by washing in ice-cold PBS. DNase-free RNase (Roche) was to cells resuspended in 0.5–1ml PBS and incubated at 37°C for 30 min before adding 50–100 ?l of Propidium Iodide (PI-0.5 mg/ml) (Roche). Cellular DNA content was analyzed on Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur using CellQuest software. X-ray crystal structure assembly The X-ray crystal structures of the ERBB4 extracellular and kinase domains were used as templates in the program SWISS-MODEL. Location of EGFR and ERBB2 mutations in the crystal were found by aligning the protein sequences for EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4 using ClustalW 30 . Previously known mutations in EGFR and ERBB2 were matched to the sequence of ERBB4 using the ClustalW alignment. Statistical analysis To determine whether the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations observed was statistically significant, the exact binomial test was used, with an expected ratio of 2.5:1. All the statistical calculations were performed in the R statistical environment ( http://www.r-project.org ) 5 . Further statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel to generate p-values to determine significance (two-tailed t-test). Inhibition curves (IC50) were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism v5.  Tumor Tissues Tissue and melanoma cell lines used in this study were described previously 24 .

Supplementary Material 1  Figures and Table Figure 1 Distribution of mutations in ERBB4 Red arrows indicate the location of ERBB4 somatic mutations found in this screen. Red stars indicate ERBB4 mutants used in subsequent analysis. Boxes represent functional domains (I, Extracellular Domain Subregion I; II, Extracellular Domain Subregion II; III, Extracellular Domain Subregion III; IV, Extracellular Domain Subregion IV; Kinase, Tyrosine Kinase Domain). Figure 2 ERBB4 mutants exhibit increased basal activation A. ERBB4 mutants have increased tyrosine phosphorylation. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs. 24 hrs after transfection, cells were serum starved, lysed and immunoprecipitated with ?-ERBB4. After immunoprecipitation of ERBB4, immunoblots were performed using specific antibodies, as indicated. Lysates were immunoblotted with an ?-tubulin antibody. B. ERBB4 mutants exhibit increased in vitro kinase activity. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected as in A. Equivalent amounts of protein from cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and used in a kinase assay to measure receptor autophosphorylation. The same samples that were used in the kinase assay were immunoblotted with ERBB4 antibody and lysates were blotted with ?-tubulin. KD: kinase dead. C. Increased basal activation of endogenous mutant ERBB4. Melanoma lines that harbor either WT or mutant ERBB4 were serum starved and then lysed, immunoprecipitated for ERBB4, then immunoblotted with?-PY20 or ?-ERBB4. D. Mutant ERBB4 has increased basal activity. Melanoma lines harboring either WT or mutant ERBB4 were serum deprived, lysed, immunoprecipitated for ERBB4, and analyzed by immunoblotting with ?-P-ERBB4 (P-Y1162) or ?-ERBB4. Figure 3 Mutant ERBB4 induces cell transformation and anchorage-independent growth in NIH 3T3 and SK-Mel-2 cells A. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. The photographs show foci stained with Hema3 after 10 days. Ras G12V was included as a positive control for cell transformation. B. The graph indicates the average number of foci visualized in A. C. Transformation ability of melanoma SK-Mel-2 cells stably expressing either vector, WT ERBB4 or various ERBB4 missense mutants was assessed by foci formation in tissue culture flasks. The graph indicates the number of foci formed after 14 days. Figure 4 Expression of mutant ERBB4 provides an essential cell survival signal in melanoma A. HEK 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with either vector or WT ERBB4 together with either control vector or shRNAs that target ERBB4. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using ?-ERBB4. For normalization, lysates were analyzed in parallel by ?-tubulin immunoblotting. B. Cells transduced with shRNA targeting ERBB4 were lysed and immunopreciptitated using ?-ERBB4 beads. Immunoprecipitates were blotted with specific antibodies, as indicated. C–G. shRNA-mediated ERBB4 knockdown in melanoma lines containing ERBB4 mutations results in reduced cell growth. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated for 13–17 days. Plates were analyzed every other day for cell proliferation where the average cell number at each time point was measured by determining DNA content using SYBR Green I. Melanoma cells harboring ERBB4 mutations stably transduced with shRNA constructs targeting ERBB4, but not those stably transduced with the control vector only, showed decreased growth relative to control. This did not occur in melanoma cells harboring WT ERBB4. Figure 5 Melanoma lines expressing ERBB4 mutants exhibit increased sensitivity to ERBB inhibition by lapatinib A. Representative dose response curves showing lapatinib efficacy against ERBB4 mutant lines compared to WT ERBB4 lines. Cells were treated for 72 hours in the presence of increasing concentrations (0.01–30 ?M) of lapatinib, and relative cell number was estimated by methylene blue protein staining and plotted as percent survival when compared to vehicle-treated control versus Log (lapatinib) nM (where 1 is 10 nM lapatinib). Fitted lines were generated using 4-parameter nonlinear regression via GraphPad Prism. B. ERBB4 mutant lines have increased sensitivity to lapatinib compared to WT ERBB4 lines. The IC50 values for inhibition of cell growth by 72 hr treatment with lapatinib of a larger panel of lines harboring WT and mutant ERBB4 were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v.5 (n=3). C. Immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis of ERBB4 autophosphorylation in cells treated with lapatinib. Cells were treated for 1 hr with lapatinib or vehicle alone as control. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with ?-ERBB4 followed by western blot analysis with ?-ERBB4 and ?-P-ERBB4 (Y1162). D. Melanoma lines expressing mutant ERBB4 exhibit increased lapatinib sensitivity with respect to ERBB4 as well as AKT phosphorylation. The activity of ERBB4, AKT as well as ERBB2 was determined by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies. Cells were treated for 1 hr with 5 ?M lapatinib or vehicle alone. Lysates were immunoprecipitated using ?-ERBB2 or ?-ERBB4. Lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by western blotting using the indicated antibodies. Shown are representative blots. E. Quantitative assessment of data from 2 lines harboring WT ERBB4 and 3 lines harboring mutant ERBB4 that were performed similarly to D. D. The ratio of band intensities of (P-Y1162)-ERBB4/ERBB4, (P)-S473-AKT/AKT and (P-Y1248)-ERBB2/ERBB2 for each cell line are shown. F. Mutant ERBB4 cells have increased sub-G1 population in the presence of lapatinib compared to WT ERBB4 cells.
