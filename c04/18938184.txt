Alteration of microvascular permeability in acute kidney injury Functional and structural abnormalities in the renal microvasculature are important processes contributing to the pathophysiology of ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI). Renewed interest in the complex interplay between tubular injury, inflammation and microvascular alterations has emerged in order to gain a better understanding of acute kidney injury syndromes. This review examines alterations of the renal microvasculature as they relate to ischemic and septic AKI with an emphasis on the mechanisms involved in altered microvascular permeability.
