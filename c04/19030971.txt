Insulin Receptor Substrates (IRSs) and breast tumorigenesis Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 are adaptor proteins in the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)/IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) pathway that mediate cell proliferation, migration, and survival. In addition to their role as scaffolding proteins in the cytoplasm, they are able to translocate into the nucleus and regulate gene transcription. IRS levels are developmentally and hormonally regulated in the normal mammary gland and both are essential for normal mammary gland bud formation and lactation. Both IRS-1 and IRS-2 are transforming oncogenes, and induce transformation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. In breast cancer IRSs have unique functions, with IRS-1 being mainly involved in cell proliferation and survival, whereas IRS-2 has clear roles in cell migration and metastasis. In this review we will discuss the roles of IRSs in mammary gland development and breast cancer.  5) Summary IRSs are critical elements in the IGF-IR signaling pathway and have themselves been shown to be transforming oncogenes. Studies in breast cancer cell lines and in mice have shown divergent roles for IRS-1 and IRS-2 in proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. Despite all of this evidence, studies in human breast cancer are inconsistent and require further investigation. This is in part due to the paucity of studies, and also the measurement of total protein levels rather than IRS activation. Further studies using phosho-specific antibodies are likely to highlight important roles for IRSs in human breast cancer and measurement may eventually play a role in predicting response to anti-IGF-IR therapies.
