Current and Future Therapies of Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Arrest Objective To review contemporary guidelines and therapies for pediatric cardiac arrest and discuss potential novel therapies. Methods Key articles and guidelines in the field were reviewed along with recent publications in the fields of neurointensive care and neuroscience germane to cerebral resuscitation. Results A total of 45 articles were reviewed. The majority of arrests in the pediatric population are asphyxial in originâ€”which differs importantly from the adult population. The International Consensus on CPR guidelines are discussed, including good quality CPR, chest compressions without interruptions, resuscitation with 100% oxygen and subsequent titration of oxygen to normal oxygen saturations, correct dose of epinephrine, and use of hypothermia in the first 12-24 hours. Novel therapies that showed success in animal studies, such as hypertensive reperfusion, thrombolytics, hemodilution and extracorporeal CPR are also discussed. Conclusion With only 30% return of spontaneous circulation, 12% survival to hospital discharge and 4% intact neurologic survival, pediatric cardiac arrest remains an area of intense research for therapies to improve its outcomes. In addition to the rapid implementation of basic and advanced life support interventions, new therapies that may have value include mild hypothermia, extracorporeal support, promotion of cerebral blood flow and other more novel therapies targeting oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, neuronal death, and rehabilitation.
