EGFR-targeted therapies in lung cancer: predictors of response and toxicity The EGFR pathway has emerged as a key target in non-small-cell lung cancer. EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibition in non-small-cell lung cancer is achieved via small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib or gefitinib, or monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab. A growing body of evidence is identifying potential molecular predictors of response and toxicity. This includes tumor-related molecular markers, such as EGFR mutation and copy number, as well as germline markers such as polymorphisms in EGFR or EGFR pathway-related genes. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge of predictors of response and toxicity to EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer.
