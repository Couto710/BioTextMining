Spindle assembly checkpoint and p53 deficiencies cooperate for tumorigenesis in mice The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) guards against chromosomal mis-segregation during mitosis. To investigate the role of SAC in tumor development, mice heterozygously knocked-out for the mitotic arrest deficient (Mad) genes Mad1 and/or Mad2 were mated with p53 +/? mice. Increased tumor frequencies were reproducibly observed in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (88.2%) and Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (95.0%) mice compared to p53 +/? (66.7%) mice. Moreover, 53% of Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice developed lymphomas compared to 11% of p53 +/? mice. By examining chromosome content, increased loss in diploidy was seen in cells from Mad2 +/? p53 +/? versus p53 +/? mice, correlating loss of SAC function, in a p53 +/? context, with increased aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. The findings here provide evidence for a cooperative role of Mad1/Mad2 and p53 genes in preventing tumor development.  INTRODUCTION The development and growth of organisms require faithful partitioning of the mother genome to daughter progenies. Genome integrity and cellular proliferation are regulated by elaborate networks that include cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA repair and recombination factors, and apoptosis regulators. 1 , 2 Aberrations in these regulations can alter the structural integrity of chromosomes and/or induce chromosome instability (CIN). 3 – 5 CIN is frequently associated with cancerous and pre-cancerous tissues. 6 , 7 Mechanistically, the acquisition of a CIN phenotype may result in numerous changes in gene copies leading to the occurrence of genetic permutations and combinations that confer proliferative and survival advantages to cells. 4 , 8 The different events that cause chromosomal mis-segregation are not completely understood. 9 , 10 CIN cells lose or gain chromosome(s) with high frequency, suggesting that these cells are defective in some of the processes that govern orderly partitioning of chromosomes. 11 The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is one cellular mechanism that monitors the accuracy of chromosome segregation. 12 The SAC was first identified when Saccharomyces cerevisiae was screened for genes required for fidelity of chromosome transmission. 13 , 14 Currently, the SAC encompasses several proteins that are located at kinetochores, including the mitotic arrest deficient (MAD) proteins (MAD1, MAD2 and MAD3), the budding uninhibited by benzimidazole (BUB) proteins (BUB1, BUB2 and BUB3/BUBR1), the monopolar spindle 1 protein (MPS1), the ROD-ZW10-Zwilch complex, and the microtubule motor centromere protein E (CENP-E). 15 Experimental findings are consistent with defects in SAC enhancing tumorigenesis. 16 , 17 For example, individuals who are mutated in both alleles of the BubR1 protein develop childhood cancers (e.g. rhabdomyosarcoma and leukemia); 18 , 19 and, up to 40% of human lung cancer cells carry defects in mitotic checkpoint genes, including Mad1 and Mad2 . 20 , 21 In experimental mouse models, homozygous loss of SAC proteins (e.g. Mad1 ?/?, Mad2 ?/?, BubR1 ?/? or Bub3 ?/?) are embryonic lethal. 22 – 26 However, mice deficient in SAC function by virtue of a heterozygous knock-out of a single Mad1 , Mad2 , BubR1 , Bub3 or CENP-E allele are developmentally viable but show mildly increased rates of tumor development. Hence, Mad1 +/?, Mad2 +/? and CENP-E +/? mice all have higher cancer rates compared to wt littermates. 23 , 25 , 27 On the other hand, mice heterozygous for BubR1 ( BubR1 +/?) or Bub3 ( Bub3 +/?) do not present with constitutively higher rates of cancers; but, they, when exposed to carcinogens, do develop more tumors than similarly exposed wt mice. 22 , 28 , 29 The p53 protein contributes to a checkpoint pathway distinct from the SAC. P53 serves a G1/S checkpoint that detects structural DNA damage and is involved in an ATM(ATR)/CHK2(CHK1)-p53/MDM2-p21 cascade. Missense mutations in p53 are common and are found in approximately 50% of human cancers. 30 Mice haploinsufficient for p53 develop sarcomas and lymphomas early in life. 31 To date, although a published report has suggested that the loss of Mad2 and p53 contributes to chromosomal mis-segregation in MEFs, 32 there are no in vivo data that address directly whether simultaneous haploinsufficiency in SAC and p53 cooperates in tumorigenesis. Here, we have generated mice with the following compound genotypes: Mad1 +/? p53 +/?, Mad2 +/? p53 +/? or Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/?. We have analyzed these mice for tumor incidence and tumor burden (i.e. multiple tumor types per mouse). We found enhanced cancer rates and increased tumor burden in mice doubly affected in both SAC and p53 compared to those singly attenuated for p53.  Materials and methods Animals and genotyping The Mad1 +/? mice were generated by gene targeting as described previously. 23 The Mad2 +/? mice were a generous gift from Dr. Robert Benezra, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. 25 Mad1 ?/? and Mad2 ?/? mice are embryonic lethal and can not be used for cancer studies. The p53 -deficient mice were purchased from the Jackson lab (strain: B6.129S2- Trp53 tm1Tyj /J). 31 The Mad1, Mad2 and p53 knockout mice were all generated in C57BL/6 × 129/sv backgrounds. 23 , 25 , 31 Genotypes of the mice were determined by polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) using primers: Mad1 (5’ -cggacgaggtatttgcacgtgcagctctattttagg-3’ and 5’-gcatgggtgagctcagtcacactgg-3’); 23 Mad2 (wt: 5’ -acctacgtcgccagtttccg-3’, mutant: 5’-tccattgctcagcggtgctg-3’ and common: 5’-ggggttcgcttctctacttgg-3’); p53 (wt: 5’- acagcgtggtggtaccttat-3’, mutant: 5’- ctatcaggacatagcgttgg-3’ and common: 5’-tatactcagagccggcct -3’). 31 Analyses of pathologies Mice were necropsied and examined by mouse pathologists. All of the internal organs (spleen, liver, pancreas, kidney, stomach, intestine, lung, heart, brain, lymph node, thyroid gland) were fixed, paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&E for analyses. Tissues that were found to be grossly abnormal at time of necropsy were multiply sectioned and stained by H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) for microscopic histological analyses. Preparation of prometaphase chromosome spread from mouse spleen Animals were sacrificed and spleens were dissected. Splenic cells were collected by forcing the spleen through a sterile 70µm nylon cell strainer (BD, Sparks, MD). The homogenized cells were cultured at 37°C in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5µg/mL concanavalin A (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), 10µg/mL lipopolysaccharide (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), 2 mM L-glutamine and antibiotics. After 24 to 48 hours of incubation, 10?7M of methotrexate was added. 17 hours later, methotrexate was removed by washing the cells twice with RPMI 1640 complete media. Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 complete media containing 25 µg/ml BrdU (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine) and incubated for another 5.5 hours. During the last 30 minutes of incubation, 0.06µg/ml demecolcine (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was added in order to arrest the cells in prometaphase. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in warm hypotonic solution containing 0.075M KCl and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes. Following incubation, a few drops of freshly prepared fixative (methanol:acetic acid=3:1) were added. Cells were washed with fixative 3 times, and chromosome spreads were prepared by dropping the cells onto chilled glass slides. Fluorescent in situ hybridization Dual-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using FITC-labeled probe specific for chromosome 11 and Cy3-labeled probe for chromosome 5 (Cambio Ltd, Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, slides with chromosome spreads of mouse cells were dehydrated with 100% ethanol, treated with pepsin and then denatured with 70% formamide/0.6xSSC at 65°C for 1.5 minutes. After 24 hours of hybridization with chromosomal paint probes, the slides were washed with 50% formamide/1xSSC, 1xSSC and 4xSSC/0.05% Tween20 successively. Finally, slides were mounted onto coverslips with antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Statistical analyses Tumor incidences were compared by the Fisher’s exact probability test using the website: http://home.clara.net/sisa/fisher.htm . The statistical analysis of tumor numbers, survival curves, and spleen weights were computed using the PRISM software (version 5.01).

Results Cooperative tumorigenicity of Mad1, Mad2 and p53 defects in mice The mitotic checkpoint proteins Mad1, Mad2 and the p53 tumor suppressor protein function through different mechanisms. To investigate their potentially cooperative effects, we bred Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? mice with p53 +/? mice to generate Mad1 +/? p53 +/?, Mad2 +/? p53 +/?, and Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mutant mice. Genotype frequencies from the breedings produced offsprings that matched closely the expected numbers ( Table 1 ), and these genetically distinct mice were monitored for tumor development. Animals that developed intractable pathologies were culled and necropsied as specified by the study protocol; and all the mice in the study groups were sacrificed at 18 months of age for analyses. In human Li-Fraumeni syndrome, germ line mutation occurs mostly in a single allele of the p53 gene. 33 – 36 Thus, we focused on mice with the p53+/? background in order to evaluate the early contribution from the loss of one p53 allele to the development of tumors. We compared the four mouse cohorts for tumors ( Fig. 1 a ). The trends showed increased tumor incidence in Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (95% tumors) > Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (88.2% tumors) > Mad1 +/? p53 +/? (76.0% tumors) > p53 +/? (66.7% tumors); there was a highly statistically significant ( p =0.024, Fisher’s exact test) difference in tumor incidence between Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? and p53 +/? mice. We next quantified the tumor burdens in the four groups. Table 2 summarizes the tumor spectrum and frequencies observed in p53 +/?, Mad1 +/? p53 +/?, Mad2 +/? p53 +/? and Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice. An expected baseline rate of lymphomas and sarcomas was seen in the p53 +/? animals; 30 however, notably, Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice (53%, 9 out of 17) showed a statistically significant ( p =0.0077) increase in lymphoma frequency compared to p53 +/? mice (11%, 2 out of 18) ( Fig. 1 a ). Lymphoma-free survival curves between the two groups were also highly distinct ( Fig. 1 b ). Moreover, the incidence of epithelial cancers, which is usually rare in p53 +/? mice (1 out of 18 in our study) with C57BL/6 × 129/sv background, 37 – 39 was substantially increased in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (3 out of 17) and Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (4 out of 20) mice ( Table 2 ). We also noted that a partial loss of SAC function in the context of p53 +/? produced larger tumor burdens per mouse ( Table 2 ). In our study, p53 +/? mice were either tumor free or invariably developed only a single type of tumor per mouse. By contrast, the SAC +/? p53 +/? compound mice were prone to have multiply different tumors per animal. On average, the tumor burden per p53 +/? mouse was 0.61±0.12, and this number increased by 44% to 0.88±0.13 ( p =0.16) in Mad1 +/? p53 +/? mice, and more than doubled in both Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (1.33±0.23; p =0.0082) and Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (1.40±0.18; p =0.0012) animals ( Fig. 1 c ). Some histological examples of tumors from the indicated mice are shown in Fig. 1 d . Taken together, these in vivo results demonstrated that the compound SAC +/? p53 +/? animals when compared to p53 +/? counterparts showed increased frequency of tumor development as well as increased numbers of tumors per mouse. Above, we observed increased tumor burden in Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/?, Mad1 +/? p53 +/?, and Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice compared to the p53 +/? animals. To understand these differences better, we also checked the tumor spectra and tumor burden of Mad1 +/?, Mad2 +/?, and Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? mice engineered with the p53 +/+ background. These latter mice were monitored for 18 months prior to necropsy and histopathological analyses ( Table 3 ). Similar to previous reports from us and others, 23 , 25 heterozygosity in Mad1 and/or Mad2 did increase the incidence of overall tumors in p53 +/+ mice. On the other hand, the incidence of lymphomas in Mad2 +/? p53 +/+ mice was no different than in wt p53 +/+ mice (also discussed by Michel et al, ref. 25), ( Table 3 ). Thus the distinctly elevated lymphoma frequency in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice compared to p53 +/? animals is likely potentiated when dual genotypic defects co-exist. Above, we also noted that the triply mutated Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice developed novel tumor types (mammary adenocarcinoma, uterus-carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) that were not seen in either p53 +/?, or Mad1 +/?, or Mad2 +/?, or Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? mice. Collectively, these findings are consistent with the notion of cooperativity between the SAC and the p53 pathway in preventing tumor formation. Enlarged spleens in Mad2<sup>+/?</sup><italic>p53</italic><sup>+/?</sup> mice The high incidence of lymphoma in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice ( Fig. 1 a , b ) was correlated with a high frequency of enlarged spleens in these animals ( Fig. 2 a , b ). On histological examination, wt spleens were well structured for red and white pulp ( Fig. 2 c , panel 1), while the white and red pulps were poorly demarcated in the Mad2 +/? p53 +/? lymphomatous spleens ( Fig. 2 c , panel 5). By comparison, the boundaries (marginal zones) that separated white from red pulp in p53 +/? lymphomatous spleens were not markedly disrupted ( Fig. 2 c , panel 3). To better understand the cause of splenomegaly, we performed immunohistochemistry on Mad2 +/? p53 +/? spleens staining for T-cell marker, CD3, and B-cell marker, Pax5 ( Fig. 2 d ). The results were highly positive for CD3, but not for Pax5 ( Fig. 2 d ), consistent with the presentation of T-cell anaplastic lymphoblastic lymphoma in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? animals. Loss of diploidy in Mad2<sup>+/?</sup>p53<sup>+/?</sup> mouse cells To ask why T-lymphomas were more aggressive in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? compared to p53 +/? mice, we wondered if the former was more prone to aneuploidy than the latter. We examined the frequency of chromosome mis-segregations in cells cultured from wt , p53 +/?, and Mad2 +/? p53 +/? spleens. Dual-color FISH was employed to monitor the diploidy of mouse chromosomes 5 and 11 in the cells ( Fig. 3 a ). Using identical culturing conditions, we triggered the proliferation of wt , p53 +/?, and Mad2 +/? p53 +/? cells from the splenic explants using concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide. Spindle toxin demecolcine was then used to arrest the cells in prometaphase, and we scored the karyotype of one hundred cells per genotype (repeated in two independent mice). Overall, 100% of the wt cells were diploid for both chromosome 5 and chromosome 11 ( Fig. 3 b ); in p53 +/? cells, the frequency of diploidy was reduced to 96% for chromosome 5 (3% triploid, 1% tetraploid) and 93% for chromosome 11 (3% monosomy, 1% triploid and 3% tetraploid); and the diploidy rate in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? was further decreased to 87% [4% triploid, 6% tetraploid and 3% multiploid (>4) for chromosome 5; 3% triploid, 7% tetraploid and 4% multiploid (>4) for chromosome 11]. These results support that a SAC deficit in a p53 +/? background increases cellular aneuploidy which was correlated with in vivo tumorigenesis in mice.

(3 out of 17) and Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (4 out of 20) mice ( Table 2 ). We also noted that a partial loss of SAC function in the context of p53 +/? produced larger tumor burdens per mouse ( Table 2 ). In our study, p53 +/? mice were either tumor free or invariably developed only a single type of tumor per mouse. By contrast, the SAC +/? p53 +/? compound mice were prone to have multiply different tumors per animal. On average, the tumor burden per p53 +/? mouse was 0.61±0.12, and this number increased by 44% to 0.88±0.13 ( p =0.16) in Mad1 +/? p53 +/? mice, and more than doubled in both Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (1.33±0.23; p =0.0082) and Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (1.40±0.18; p =0.0012) animals ( Fig. 1 c ). Some histological examples of tumors from the indicated mice are shown in Fig. 1 d . Taken together, these in vivo results demonstrated that the compound SAC +/? p53 +/? animals when compared to p53 +/? counterparts showed increased frequency of tumor development as well as increased numbers of tumors per mouse. Above, we observed increased tumor burden in Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/?, Mad1 +/? p53 +/?, and Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice compared to the p53 +/? animals. To understand these differences better, we also checked the tumor spectra and tumor burden of Mad1 +/?, Mad2 +/?, and Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? mice engineered with the p53 +/+ background. These latter mice were monitored for 18 months prior to necropsy and histopathological analyses ( Table 3 ). Similar to previous reports from us and others, 23 , 25 heterozygosity in Mad1 and/or Mad2 did increase the incidence of overall tumors in p53 +/+ mice. On the other hand, the incidence of lymphomas in Mad2 +/? p53 +/+ mice was no different than in wt p53 +/+ mice (also discussed by Michel et al, ref. 25), ( Table 3 ). Thus the distinctly elevated lymphoma frequency in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice compared to p53 +/? animals is likely potentiated when dual genotypic defects co-exist. Above, we also noted that the triply mutated Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice developed novel tumor types (mammary adenocarcinoma, uterus-carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) that were not seen in either p53 +/?, or Mad1 +/?, or Mad2 +/?, or Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? mice. Collectively, these findings are consistent with the notion of cooperativity between the SAC and the p53 pathway in preventing tumor formation.  Cooperative tumorigenicity of Mad1, Mad2 and p53 defects in mice The mitotic checkpoint proteins Mad1, Mad2 and the p53 tumor suppressor protein function through different mechanisms. To investigate their potentially cooperative effects, we bred Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? mice with p53 +/? mice to generate Mad1 +/? p53 +/?, Mad2 +/? p53 +/?, and Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mutant mice. Genotype frequencies from the breedings produced offsprings that matched closely the expected numbers ( Table 1 ), and these genetically distinct mice were monitored for tumor development. Animals that developed intractable pathologies were culled and necropsied as specified by the study protocol; and all the mice in the study groups were sacrificed at 18 months of age for analyses. In human Li-Fraumeni syndrome, germ line mutation occurs mostly in a single allele of the p53 gene. 33 – 36 Thus, we focused on mice with the p53+/? background in order to evaluate the early contribution from the loss of one p53 allele to the development of tumors. We compared the four mouse cohorts for tumors ( Fig. 1 a ). The trends showed increased tumor incidence in Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (95% tumors) > Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (88.2% tumors) > Mad1 +/? p53 +/? (76.0% tumors) > p53 +/? (66.7% tumors); there was a highly statistically significant ( p =0.024, Fisher’s exact test) difference in tumor incidence between Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? and p53 +/? mice. We next quantified the tumor burdens in the four groups. Table 2 summarizes the tumor spectrum and frequencies observed in p53 +/?, Mad1 +/? p53 +/?, Mad2 +/? p53 +/? and Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice. An expected baseline rate of lymphomas and sarcomas was seen in the p53 +/? animals; 30 however, notably, Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice (53%, 9 out of 17) showed a statistically significant ( p =0.0077) increase in lymphoma frequency compared to p53 +/? mice (11%, 2 out of 18) ( Fig. 1 a ). Lymphoma-free survival curves between the two groups were also highly distinct ( Fig. 1 b ). Moreover, the incidence of epithelial cancers, which is usually rare in p53 +/? mice (1 out of 18 in our study) with C57BL/6 × 129/sv background, 37 – 39 was substantially increased in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (3 out of 17) and Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (4 out of 20) mice ( Table 2 ). We also noted that a partial loss of SAC function in the context of p53 +/? produced larger tumor burdens per mouse ( Table 2 ).

(1.33±0.23; p =0.0082) and Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (1.40±0.18; p =0.0012) animals ( Fig. 1 c ). Some histological examples of tumors from the indicated mice are shown in Fig. 1 d . Taken together, these in vivo results demonstrated that the compound SAC +/? p53 +/? animals when compared to p53 +/? counterparts showed increased frequency of tumor development as well as increased numbers of tumors per mouse.

Enlarged spleens in Mad2<sup>+/?</sup><italic>p53</italic><sup>+/?</sup> mice The high incidence of lymphoma in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice ( Fig. 1 a , b ) was correlated with a high frequency of enlarged spleens in these animals ( Fig. 2 a , b ). On histological examination, wt spleens were well structured for red and white pulp ( Fig. 2 c , panel 1), while the white and red pulps were poorly demarcated in the Mad2 +/? p53 +/? lymphomatous spleens ( Fig. 2 c , panel 5). By comparison, the boundaries (marginal zones) that separated white from red pulp in p53 +/? lymphomatous spleens were not markedly disrupted ( Fig. 2 c , panel 3). To better understand the cause of splenomegaly, we performed immunohistochemistry on Mad2 +/? p53 +/? spleens staining for T-cell marker, CD3, and B-cell marker, Pax5 ( Fig. 2 d ). The results were highly positive for CD3, but not for Pax5 ( Fig. 2 d ), consistent with the presentation of T-cell anaplastic lymphoblastic lymphoma in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? animals.  Enlarged spleens in Mad2<sup>+/?</sup><italic>p53</italic><sup>+/?</sup> mice The high incidence of lymphoma in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice ( Fig. 1 a , b ) was correlated with a high frequency of enlarged spleens in these animals ( Fig. 2 a , b ).

Loss of diploidy in Mad2<sup>+/?</sup>p53<sup>+/?</sup> mouse cells To ask why T-lymphomas were more aggressive in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? compared to p53 +/? mice, we wondered if the former was more prone to aneuploidy than the latter. We examined the frequency of chromosome mis-segregations in cells cultured from wt , p53 +/?, and Mad2 +/? p53 +/? spleens. Dual-color FISH was employed to monitor the diploidy of mouse chromosomes 5 and 11 in the cells ( Fig. 3 a ). Using identical culturing conditions, we triggered the proliferation of wt , p53 +/?, and Mad2 +/? p53 +/? cells from the splenic explants using concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide. Spindle toxin demecolcine was then used to arrest the cells in prometaphase, and we scored the karyotype of one hundred cells per genotype (repeated in two independent mice). Overall, 100% of the wt cells were diploid for both chromosome 5 and chromosome 11 ( Fig. 3 b ); in p53 +/? cells, the frequency of diploidy was reduced to 96% for chromosome 5 (3% triploid, 1% tetraploid) and 93% for chromosome 11 (3% monosomy, 1% triploid and 3% tetraploid); and the diploidy rate in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? was further decreased to 87% [4% triploid, 6% tetraploid and 3% multiploid (>4) for chromosome 5; 3% triploid, 7% tetraploid and 4% multiploid (>4) for chromosome 11]. These results support that a SAC deficit in a p53 +/? background increases cellular aneuploidy which was correlated with in vivo tumorigenesis in mice.

These results support that a SAC deficit in a p53 +/? background increases cellular aneuploidy which was correlated with in vivo tumorigenesis in mice.  Discussion An accepted view in cancer biology is that tumorigenesis emerges after the accumulation of multiple genetic changes. The “multi-hit” notion of cancer suggests that loss of function of some tumor suppressor genes (such as p53, pRB and BRCAs) could be a first step in cancer development. How and what additional in vivo steps cooperate subsequent to a “first step” remain incompletely understood. Aneuploidy is present in more than 70% of human malignancies. It has been debated whether aneuploidy is causal or consequential of tumorigenesis. Previously, we and others have reported that heterozygous knock out in mouse of a single allele for one of several SAC genes increased the rate of cellular aneuploidy. 22 – 25 , 27 , 40 Here, we asked in the context of a p53 +/? genotype whether an additional defect in SAC function would increase in vivo cancer development. We found that mice with compound ( SAC +/? + p53 +/?) genotypes were indeed more frequently tumorigenic [with Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? > Mad2 +/? p53 +/? > Mad1 +/? p53 +/? > p53 +/? ( Fig. 1 a )], and showed higher tumor burden per mouse ( Fig. 1 c , Table 2 ). To our knowledge, this is the first report that a simultaneous deficit in SAC and p53 cooperates to increase in vivo cancer rates. Currently, two major checkpoints employed by the cell have been proposed to maintain chromosomal integrity. One is the SAC in M phase 41 composed by a complex of proteins, including Mad1 and Mad2; and the other is the G1/S checkpoint anchored by p53. 42 Genetically damaged cells that fail either of these two checkpoints are arrested from progressing to the next phase of the cell cycle and may be subjected to apoptosis. Thus SAC and p53 act in different portions of the cell cycle and in different ways to prevent genetic damage that could provide the initiating event for cellular transformation. What could result if a cell were simultaneously defective in p53 and SAC? Here we report that mice defective for both p53 and Mad1 and/or Mad2 function were increased in tumor incidence compared to those mice singly defective for p53 or Mad1/2. Thus, our in vivo results are in agreement with a published report of enhanced chromosome mis-segregation in cultured cells triggered by the simultaneous deletion of Mad2 and p53. 32 In our mice, haploinsufficiency in Mad2 function contributed more significantly to tumor manifestation than comparable haploinsufficiency in Mad1. Current thoughts are that Mad1 recruits Mad2 to the spindle-unattached kinetochore converting an inactive Mad2 to its checkpoint-active, Cdc20-APC/C-competent, form. 43 – 45 In this regard, Mad1 acts as a regulator of Mad2-effector function. In vivo , the higher tumor burden in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? vs . Mad1 +/? p53 +/? animals ( Fig. 1 c ) suggests that partial loss of the downstream Mad2 effector function is more potent for tumorigenicity than a corresponding deficit in the upstream Mad1 regulator. 46 Finally, it is worth noting the different tumor spectra in Mad1 +/? p53 +/?, Mad2 +/? p53 +/?, Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/?, and p53 +/? mice ( Table 2 ). Collectively, the results suggest that different tissues may respond differently to individual and/or combined loss of p53 and SAC function. Thus, an earlier study had shown that Mad2 +/? p53 +/+ mice developed only papillary lung adenocarcinoma. 25 Here, our Mad2 +/? p53 +/? animals did have a modest increase in lung adenocarcinomas, but had a more substantial increase in lymphomas ( Table 2 ). Curiously, our Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? cohort had a lower lymphoma rate than the Mad2 +/? p53 +/? counterparts ( Table 2 ). It may be that the mis-segregated chromosomes generated by a Mad2 +/? p53 +/? genotype leads to carcinogenesis while further mis-segregations seen with the Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? geneotype create a substantially elevated genetic disorder which may trigger in certain lymphoid tissue cell death rather than cancer formation. Indeed, one such explanation was suggested for CENP-E +/? mice where a surfeit of aneuploidy actually decreased, not increased, tumor development. 27 Thus, a possible take home lesson from the current study is that superimposed losses in checkpoint, rather than always being additive, could instead produce complex outcomes in the rates and types of tumors.

( b ) Mean mass and standard deviation of spleens freshly dissected from adult wt , p53 +/?, Mad1 +/? p53 +/?, Mad2 +/? p53 +/? and Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice. P- values (t-test) between different groups and the p53 +/? group are indicated in brackets. ( c ) H&E-stained sections of a wt normal spleen (panels 1–2) and lymphomatous spleens from p53 +/? (panels 3–4) and Mad2 +/? p53 +/? (panels 5–6) mice. Light microscopy images at low (12.5×) and high magnification (400×) are shown. WP, white pulp; RP, red pulp. ( d ) Immunohistochemistry of CD3 and Pax5 staining for a lymphomatous spleen from a Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mouse. Hematoxylin was used to counterstain the nuclei. Images were taken at two magnifications (12.5× and 400×). The results show that the Mad2 +/? p53 +/? spleens are grossly positive for T-cell marker CD3 but negative for B-cell marker Pax5. FIGURE 3 Increased frequency of aneuploidy in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? cells. ( a ) Detection of chromosome contents in wt , p53 +/?, and Mad2 +/? p53 +/? cells by dual-color FISH using whole chromosome 11 (green) and chromosome 5 (red) specific probes. DNA was stained with DAPI (blue). ( b ) Histogram plot of chromosome counts (i.e. chromosome 11 and chromosome 5 stained by FISH) of cells from wt , p53 +/? and Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice (two animals of each genotype were analyzed). One hundred metaphase spreads from each genotype were analyzed. The frequency of aneuploidy was significantly ( p =0.0145, t-test, comparing p53 +/? and Mad2 +/? p53 +/?) increased in Mad2 +/? p53 +/? mice. Table 1 Expected and actual genotype frequencies of the litters from parents that are heterozygous for Mad1 , Mad2 or p53 . Representative litters from three breeder pairs are shown. breeder 1 ( wt × Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? p53 +/?) breeder 2 ( Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? × p53 +/?) breeder 3 ( Mad1 +/? Mad2 +/? × p53 +/?)
