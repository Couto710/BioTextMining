THE CELL OF ORIGIN OF OVARIAN EPITHELIAL TUMORS Although ovarian epithelial tumors are widely believed to arise in the coelomic epithelium that covers the ovarian surface, it was also suggested that they could instead arise from tissues that are embryologically derived from the mullerian ducts. This article revisits this debate based on recent epidemiological and molecular biological observations as well as evidence based on histopathological observations of surgical specimens from individuals with familial ovarian cancer predisposition. Morphological, embryological, and molecular biological characteristics of ovarian epithelial tumors that must be accounted for in formulating a theory about their cell of origin are reviewed, followed by comments about the ability of these two hypotheses to account for each of these characteristics. An argument is made that primary ovarian epithelial tumors fallopian tube carcinomas, and primary peritoneal carcinomas are all mullerian in nature and could therefore be regarded as a single disease entity. Although a significant proportion of cancers presently regarded as of primary ovarian origin arise in the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube, this site cannot account for an equally significant proportion of these tumors, which are most likely derived from components of the secondary mullerian system.
