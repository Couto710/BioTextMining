NEONATAL HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND INTRAVENTRICULAR HEMORRHAGE: A CASE STUDY Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare heart rate variability (HRV) in low risk preterm infants to one infant diagnosed with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Method A case study design was used to compare HRV of one subject diagnosed with IVH to a convenience sample of 38 low-risk preterm infants at 30 and 31 post-menstrual weeks of age. Heart periods were recorded for 300-s with the infant in an active sleep state. Heart rate variability was quantified by spectral analysis. A confidence interval comparison of the total spectral components (0.02–2.0 Hz), high frequency components (0.20–2.0 Hz), and the low frequency components (0.02–0.20 Hz) was conducted. Findings At 30 weeks’ post-menstrual age, 10-days following diagnosis with a grade-III IVH, the low frequency components were above the 90th percentile. One week later, at 31 weeks, the low frequency components had decreased to the 27th percentile range and the total and high frequency components were at or below the 25th percentile range of the confidence intervals for the low-risk preterm infants. Discussion The neurobehavioral organization of preterm infants is limited, due to prematurity and the cumulative effect of medical complications (such as IVH). This study has implications for the use of HRV in the identification of infants diagnosed with IVH.  Method Procedure The current study compared the HRV of low-risk preterm infants (in the larger study), to one infant diagnosed with IVH (Infant A) at 30 and 31 weeks’ post-menstrual age. Study procedures occurred during weekly test sessions and were performed for all infants while they remained in their assigned incubator beds. Recordings of infants' HRV were initiated at least 15 minutes following a meal and once they were determined to be in an active sleep state of the sleep-wake cycle ( Thoman, 1990 ). Recordings of the ECG lasted 300-s and occurred at approximately the same time of day for each infant (between 10 AM–12 PM) in an attempt to control for potential circadian influences on heart rate patterns and movements ( Arduini et. al., 1995 ). Cardiac data collection system The electrocardiogram signal (ECG) was sampled at equal intervals for 300-s at a rate of 500 Hz . The signal was transferred using ECG electrodes attached in the standard three-lead manner (via an RS232 interface and software) from an Agilent Neonatal monitor (Model #1092A) to a Dell Inspiron 8100 laptop. A Matlab program was used to filter or smooth the signal by removing noise components and baseline wander. The filtered signal was then passed through a QRS detection algorithm (also implemented in Matlab), resulting in a time series of R-R intervals, or heart periods. Spectral analysis of heart periods Spectral analysis of the heart periods was performed off-line using a Lomb procedure ( Lomb, 1976 ). The total or entire spectrum (0.02–2.0 Hz) was examined except for very low frequencies (0.0–0.02 Hz), since these components are typically produced by slow-trend artifacts (or noise). The high frequency components (0.20–2.0 Hz)—occurring in response to respirations and controlled only by the parasympathetic nervous system. The low frequency components (0.02–0.20 Hz) reflecting a mix of sympathetic and parasympathetic control ( Akselrod, 1981 ; Chatow, Davidson, Reishman, & Akselrod, 1995 ; Pomeranz et al., 1985 ; Reed, Ohel, David, & Porges, 1999 ). Sleep-wake criteria Criteria for use with preterm infants ( Thoman, 1990 ) was employed to detect an active sleep state during each test session and was confirmed post-hoc by also evaluating infants’ range of short-term heart rate variability ( Nijhuis et al., 1982 ). Infants were determined to be in an active sleep state if: 1) respirations were irregular, 2) no body movement was present, 3) eyes were closed, and 4) heart rate variability ?5 beats per minute (performed post-hoc). Interrater reliability in state detection was maintained at ? 90% agreement.

Findings Low-risk preterm infants The overall mean, range and standard deviation for the low-risk subjects at 30 weeks post-menstrual age was as follows: low frequency (M=2.84, sd=1.25, range=0.08–4.88); high frequency (M=0.18, sd=0.23, range=0.03–0.80); total spectrum (M=0.68, sd=0.26, range=0.04–1.04). The overall mean, range and standard deviation for the low-risk subjects at 31 weeks’ post-menstrual age was as follows: low frequency (M=2.76, sd=1.10, range=0.65–5.10); high frequency (M=0.18, sd=0.22, range=0.0.02–0.68); total spectrum (M=0.66, sd=0.25, range=0.19–1.10). Infant A At 30 weeks for infant A, the low (4.37 Hz) frequency value was at the 91st percentile. Total (0.97 Hz) and high (0.20 Hz) frequency values were the 86th and 82nd percentile, respectively. Percentiles divide the data into 100 equal parts, each representing one percent of all the values. For infant A at 31 weeks, the low (1.86 Hz) frequency and total (0.38 Hz) values were at the 27th and 19th percentiles, respectively. The high (0.04 Hz) frequency value had similarly decreased to the 23th percentile (see Figure 1 ).  Low-risk preterm infants The overall mean, range and standard deviation for the low-risk subjects at 30 weeks post-menstrual age was as follows: low frequency (M=2.84, sd=1.25, range=0.08–4.88); high frequency (M=0.18, sd=0.23, range=0.03–0.80); total spectrum (M=0.68, sd=0.26, range=0.04–1.04).

Infant A At 30 weeks for infant A, the low (4.37 Hz) frequency value was at the 91st percentile. Total (0.97 Hz) and high (0.20 Hz) frequency values were the 86th and 82nd percentile, respectively. Percentiles divide the data into 100 equal parts, each representing one percent of all the values.

The high (0.04 Hz) frequency value had similarly decreased to the 23th percentile (see Figure 1 ).  Discussion Within 10-days of diagnosis with a grade-III IVH, infant A exhibited measures of HRV above the 50th percentile range of the low-risk subjects. One week later (31 weeks’ post-menstrual age), the infant continued to exhibit measures of HRV outside the 50th percentile range; however, they were then in the lower 25th percentile. While case studies are limited by generalizability ( Luck, Jackson, & Usher, 2006 ), these findings substantiate reported lower high frequency component values 8 weeks following birth in infants with IVH ( Hanna et al., 2000 ). These findings, suggest the need for longitudinal descriptions of how changes in HRV occur for infants diagnosed with IVH. Previous research describing normative trends in HRV suggests there is a general shift from no change in the high frequency components (prior to 28 weeks) to an increase in high frequency components between 31 to 40 post-menstrual weeks ( Chatow et al., 1995 ; Clairambault, Curzi-Dascalova, Kauffmann, Medigue, & Leffler, 1992 ; Sahni et al., 2000 ). The current case study, with its trend of relative decrease in high frequency components and increase in low frequency components between 30–31 weeks’ post-menstrual age, demonstrates the usefulness of normative descriptions during this time period. Findings reported here at 31 weeks’ post-menstrual age (or 17 days following diagnosis of IVH), are further supported by work conducted by Porges and colleagues, who used spectral analysis of HRV as a tool for differentiating between low and high risk status in the newborn and preterm infant ( DiPietro, O'Brien Caughy, Cusson & Fox, 1994 ; Doussard-Roosevelt, McClenny, & Porges, 2001 ; Fox, & Porges, 1985 ; Porges, Doussard Roosevelt, Portales, & Suess, 1994 ). Porges et al. demonstrated significant relationships between high frequency components of HRV and developmental outcomes, suggesting that lower values are related to greater risk status of the infant (greater days hospitalized/on respiratory support, less weight gain, and lower Bayley scores at 1-year of age) ( DiPietro et al., 1994 ; Doussard-Roosevelt et al., 2001 ; Fox, & Porges, 1985 ; Porges et al., 1994 ). Additional factors potentially impacting the study outcome were also investigated. Previous critiques of studies involving preterm infants have included calls to address the impact of varied levels of respiratory support, and medications provided, ( Philbin & Klass, 2000 ). Post-hoc analyses of the normative data provided by low-risk subjects revealed that none of these factors significantly interacted with the primary outcome variable (HRV).

Clinical Implications The vast majority of infants do not display any behavioral changes prior to significant intracranial bleeds ( Blackburn, 1998 ). As caretakers of preterm infants, however, we can educate ourselves to detect the subtle changes in behavior that may precede the development of intraventricular hemorrhage. These changes may include hypotonia, abnormal eye movements or positions, and/or an unexplained decrease in hematocrit by 10% or more ( Blackburn, 1998 ). Beyond this, with increased involvement of parents at the bedside, providing educational information has become a necessary component of any infant’s care. It is therefore essential that methods to limit increased intracranial pressure are taught and explanations for these actions provided (see Table 2 ). The ability to identify increased risk for IVH, along with the possibility of intervening sooner to decrease negative outcomes, is of vital importance to those providing care for preterm infants, but new tools are needed. This case study provides important supportive evidence that measures of HRV may prove useful in detecting IVH earlier. HRV was measured within 10 days of diagnosis of IVH with comparisons to low-risk preterm infants revealing substantial differences. While future studies are needed to increase confidence in the findings, studies like the one reported here highlight the fragile status of the preterm infant. Case study designs, fortunately, allow the researcher to begin exploring situations (like IVH) that do not come about frequently ( Luck et al., 2006 ).
