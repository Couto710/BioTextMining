Targeting (V600E) B-Raf and Akt3 using Nanoliposomal-siRNA Inhibits Cutaneous Melanocytic Lesion Development Most events promoting early melanoma development are yet to be identified but deregulation of the B-Raf and Akt3 signaling cascades are important regulators of this process. Approximately 90% of normal moles and ~60% of early invasive cutaneous melanomas contain a T1799A B-Raf mutation (V600EB-Raf), leading to 10X higher enzyme activity and constitutive activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Furthermore, ~70% of melanomas have elevated Akt3 signaling due to increased gene copy number and PTEN loss. Therefore, targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 signaling is necessary to prevent or treat cutaneous melanocytic lesions. Agents specifically targeting these proteins are needed, having fewer side effects than those inhibiting both normal and mutant B-Raf protein or targeting all three Akt isoforms. In this study, a unique nanoliposomal-ultrasound mediated approach has been developed for delivering siRNA specifically targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 into melanocytic tumors present in skin to retard melanoma development. Novel cationic nanoliposomes stably encapsulate siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf or Akt3, providing protection from degradation and facilitating entry into melanoma cells to decrease expression of these proteins. Low-frequency ultrasound using a lightweight 4-cymbal transducer array enables penetration of nanoliposomal-siRNA complex throughout epidermal and dermal layers of laboratory-generated or animal skin. Nanoliposomal-mediated siRNA targeting of V600EB-Raf and Akt3 led to a cooperatively acting ~65% decrease in early or invasive cutaneous melanoma compared to inhibition of each singly with negligible associated systemic toxicity. Thus, cationic nanoliposomes loaded with siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 provide an effective approach for targeted inhibition of early or invasive cutaneous melanomas.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines and culture conditions Human melanoma cell lines UACC 903, UACC 903-GFP, 1205 Lu, C8161.Cl9, and human fibroblasts, FF2441, were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT). WM35 and WM35-GFP cells were grown as described previously ( 27 ). Human keratinocytes, HFK, were grown in Epilife Medium with Human Keratinocyte Growth Supplement (Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR). Mouse melanocytes, melan-a, were grown in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 200 nM TPA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Liposome composition, characterization and siRNA loading Nanoliposomes were created by combining DOTAP (1,2-Dioleoyl-3-Trimethylammonium-Propane), DOPE (1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphoethanolamine) and DSPE-PEG(2000) (1,2-Distearoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphoethanolamine-N-[Amino(Polyethylene Glycol)[2000]) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in chloroform at a 4.75:4.75:0.5 molar ratio ( 28 , 29 ). siRNA and nanoliposomes complexing occurred at specific weight ratios of 1:5, 1:10, and 1:15 for 0.5–24 h. A quasielastic light scattering system (Malvern Nanosizer, Malvern Instruments, UK) was used to measure particle diameter of nanoliposomes ±siRNA 1-d after preparation. Nanoliposomal loading of siRNA was measured by mixing fluorescent, Alexa Fluor 546 tagged-siRNA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with nanoliposomes at specific weight ratios (1:5, 1:10, 1:15) and complexing at room temperature for 0.5, 3 or 6 h. Loading was considered complete when no free siRNA was evident with complex remaining in well of a 2% agarose gel. To measure liposome-mediated protection of siRNA, nanoliposomes complexed with siRNA overnight were treated with 50% FBS for 10, 30, 60, 180, or 360 m. Following FBS treatment, half of the complex at each time point was treated with 0.5% SDS for 10 m at 37°C to disrupt the complexes and release free siRNA. siRNA alone was also digested with 50% FBS at each time point to serve as a control. All samples were run on a 2% agarose gel at 100 V for 20 m and visualized using UV. Nanoliposomal toxicity To assess cytotoxicity of nanoliposomes complexed with siRNA in normal or cancer cells; 5×103 fibroblasts (FF2441), keratinocytes (HFK), melanocytes (melan-a), and melanoma (1205 Lu) cells were plated into 96-well plates and 48 h later treated with ghost nanoliposomes for 24 h at nanoliposomal concentrations of 12.5, 25, and 50 ?M or exposed to 125, 250, 500, 1000, or 2000 nM of siRNA complexed with nanoliposomes and compared to untreated control cells. Cytotoxicity was analyzed using the Cell Titer 96 aqueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Uptake of nanoliposomal siRNA into cells Uptake and internalization of nanoliposomal siRNA into cells was determined using Alexa Fluor 546, and/or fluorescein tagged siRNA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 1×105 1205 Lu cells were plated and following overnight growth, nanoliposomal-siRNA complex (100 nM) or ghost nanoliposomes added. 3 h later, cells were trypsinzed and plated onto coverslips followed by overnight incubation. Uptake of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex by fibroblasts (FF2441), keratinocytes (HFK), or melanocytes (melan-a) was measured by plating 5×103 cells onto coverslips and 2-d later, adding nanoliposomal siRNA (50, 100, or 200 nM) for 3 h. Following all conditions, cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 4% parafomaldehyde (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 30 m, washed in PBS, mounted in DAPI containing mountant (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and fluorescence microscopy used to measure uptake. Nucleofection of siRNA into cells Stealth siRNA (1.5–200 pmoles) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was introduced via an Amaxa Nucleofector (Koeln, Germany) into 1×106 UACC 903, UACC 903-GFP or C8161.Cl9 cells using Solution R/Program K-17 or WM35-GFP cells using NHEM-NEO Solution/Program U-20. Resulting transfection efficiency was ~99% ( 8 ). Duration of siRNA-mediated protein knockdown at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 d following nucleofection was measured for B-Raf or C-Raf by Western blot analysis. Cells used in reconstructed skin were nucleofected with buffer, siMutB-Raf (100, 50, or 12.5 pmoles), siC-Raf (100 pmoles), or scrambled (100 pmoles) siRNA, plated into culture dishes and 2 d later mixed with keratinocytes, which was added onto the dermis as detailed below. Protein lysates of remaining cells were analyzed by Western blotting. Western Blot Analysis Western blot analysis, was conducted as described previously ( 30 ). Blots were probed with primary antibodies to B-Raf, Erk2, and C-Raf and secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoblots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Blots were normalized to Erk2 and quantified using ImageJ software ( 31 ). Nanoliposomal-siRNA mediated protein knockdown 5×105 1205 Lu cells were plated in 6-well plates for 2 d and nanoliposomal-siMutB-Raf or -siScrambled complex (1?M) added. Protein lysates were collected 18 and 32 h later for Western blot analysis measuring B-Raf and Erk2 expression. Protein levels were quantified from three independent blots using ImageJ software, normalized to Erk2 and average B-Raf levels calculated ( 31 ). Generation of skin containing melanocytic lesions To create skin in a culture dish, human fibroblasts, were trypsinized and resuspended in 10% reconstitution buffer, 10% 10× DMEM (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), 2.4 ?l/ml of 10 M NaOH, and 80% collagen I (BD, Bedford, MA) at a concentration of 2.5×105 cells/ml on ice ( 32 ). Mixture was then aliquoted into 6 or 12 well plates and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. E-media was added to each well to equilibrate the dermal matrix ( 32 ). After 2 d growth, keratinocytes and melanoma cells (WM35-GFP or UACC 903-GFP) were trypsinized and resuspended at a 1:10 ratio of melanoma cells (nucleofected or untreated) to keratinocytes in E-media. 1 ml of cell suspension added to each well on top of the dermal layer. Following 2 d growth, reconstructed skin was transferred onto wire grids and fed via diffusion from E-media below the platforms. Ultrasound transducer design and calibration The cymbal transducer is a novel thin flextensional transducer capable of producing very low frequencies ( 33 , 34 ). It has a compact, lightweight structure with an adjustable resonance frequency. Caps on the lead zirconate-titanate ceramic contain a shallow cavity beneath the inner surface. The fundamental mode of vibration is flexing of the end caps caused by radial motion of the ceramic. Therefore, the overall displacement of the device is a combination of the axial motion of disk plus radial motion amplified by the end caps ( 23 , 24 ). A radio frequency signal was generated by a frequency pulse/function generator (Agilent 32250A, Palo Alto, CA) and amplified using an amplifier (Model 40A12, Amplifier Research, Souderton, PA). Electrical impedance of the array was tuned to the output impedance of the amplifier by an external inductor-capacitor tuning network. Pulse period, duty cycle and exposure time of radio frequency signal from the frequency generator was monitored using an oscilloscope (Tektronix 2213A, Beaverton, OR). For experiments, signal generator operated at 20 kHz with pulse duration of 200 ms and pulse repetition period of 1 second (i.e. 20% duty cycle); the amplifier gain was set to 50 dB. Pulsed ultrasound was used to avoid heat generation, which could damage array or skin. Ultrasound treatment and analysis of damage, nanoliposomal siRNA uptake, and tumor inhibition in reconstructed skin Skin reconstructs were treated with ultrasound at a frequency of 20 kHz and duty cycle of 20% for 20 m by removing media and submersion in PBS ( 26 ). 1 ?M nanoliposomal-siRNA complex was then applied topically and allowed to soak into the skin. Skin damage was assessed following ultrasound treatment, addition of ghost liposome and fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C overnight. H&E stained paraffin embedded cross sections were examined for skin damage using microscopy. Skin reconstruct uptake studies involved treating with nanoliposomes containing 1 ?M Alexa Fluor 546 siRNA or ghost nanoliposomes and uptake analyzed using stereo fluorescence microscopy 1-h later. Skin reconstructs were treated with ultrasound followed by treatment with nanoliposomes containing B-Raf siRNA or ghost nanoliposomes on alternate days from days 10–21. Skin reconstructs from all experiments were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C overnight. After fixation skin was stored in 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0 (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Total average area occupied by GFP-tagged tumor nodules present in 4–6 skin images were used to quantify differences between treatment groups using IP Lab software. Cell doubling time In vitro doubling time of UACC 903 cells nucleofected with siRNA was estimated by plating 3×103 UACC 903 cell in 96-well plates and at 24-h intervals, using the SRB assay (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to measure growth rate and calculate doubling times ( 8 ). In vivo cell proliferation For mechanistic studies, 5×106 UACC 903 cells nucleofected with siRNA were injected into mice and tumors harvested 4 d later to quantify cell proliferation in formalin-fixed tumor sections using the RPN 20 cell proliferation kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) ( 8 ). Anchorage independent growth 1×106 UACC 903 cells were nucleofected with siAkt3 (200 pmoles), siMutB-Raf (3, 6, or 12 pmoles), siScrambled or buffer, allowed to recover for 2 d and then plated in serum free DMEM (1×104/well) into polyHEMA-coated 96 well plates. Cell viability was assessed 3-d later using the MTS assay ( 9 ). Ultrasound and siRNA-nanoliposomal complex treatment of tumors 1×106 UACC 903-GFP cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of nude mice. After 24 h, mice were ultrasound treated for 15 minutes followed by topical application of 25 ?g nanoliposomal-siRNA (siMutB-Raf, siAKt3 or siScrambled) complex on alternate days. For combination nanoliposomal V600EB-Raf and Akt3 siRNA studies, mice were treated with the same regime as the single agents. Single agents were compensated with extra liposomes so equivalent amounts were used. Prior to ultrasound treatment, mice were anesthetized using 2:1 ketamine/xylazine, and area sterilized using alcohol pads. Aquaflex Gel Pads (Parker Laboratories, Inc., Fairfield, NJ) served as an ultrasound standoff. Ultrasound was administered for 15 m at a frequency of 20 kHz and duty cycle of 20% ( 26 ). Nanoliposomal siRNA was applied to ultrasound treated area overlying tumor for penetration into skin. Toxicity analysis in mice To establish toxicity associated with ultrasound plus siRNA-nanoliposomal complex, nude mice were ultrasound treated for 15 m followed by topical addition of nanoliposomal-siRNA (siMutB-Raf, siAkt3, siScrambled or siMutB-Raf + siAkt3) complex on alternate days. Mice were weighed on alternate days to ascertain toxicity. Following euthanization on day 23, blood was collected from siMutB-Raf and siScrambled mice and serum separated to measure serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), glucose, and alkaline phosphatase. Livers were fixed in formalin, sectioned and stained with H&E to assess liver morphology changes. Statistical analysis One-Way or Two-Way ANOVA followed by appropriate post hoc test (Tukey’s or Bonferroni) or t-test was used to ascertain whether significant differences occurred between groups. Differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Combination Index (CI) was calculated using the Chou-Talalay method with CalcuSyn software to establish mechanistic basis for cooperative inhibition mediated by siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 ( 35 ).  Cell lines and culture conditions Human melanoma cell lines UACC 903, UACC 903-GFP, 1205 Lu, C8161.Cl9, and human fibroblasts, FF2441, were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT). WM35 and WM35-GFP cells were grown as described previously ( 27 ). Human keratinocytes, HFK, were grown in Epilife Medium with Human Keratinocyte Growth Supplement (Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR).

Nanoliposomal toxicity To assess cytotoxicity of nanoliposomes complexed with siRNA in normal or cancer cells; 5×103 fibroblasts (FF2441), keratinocytes (HFK), melanocytes (melan-a), and melanoma (1205 Lu) cells were plated into 96-well plates and 48 h later treated with ghost nanoliposomes for 24 h at nanoliposomal concentrations of 12.5, 25, and 50 ?M or exposed to 125, 250, 500, 1000, or 2000 nM of siRNA complexed with nanoliposomes and compared to untreated control cells. Cytotoxicity was analyzed using the Cell Titer 96 aqueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI).  Uptake of nanoliposomal siRNA into cells Uptake and internalization of nanoliposomal siRNA into cells was determined using Alexa Fluor 546, and/or fluorescein tagged siRNA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 1×105 1205 Lu cells were plated and following overnight growth, nanoliposomal-siRNA complex (100 nM) or ghost nanoliposomes added. 3 h later, cells were trypsinzed and plated onto coverslips followed by overnight incubation.

Following all conditions, cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 4% parafomaldehyde (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 30 m, washed in PBS, mounted in DAPI containing mountant (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and fluorescence microscopy used to measure uptake.  Nucleofection of siRNA into cells Stealth siRNA (1.5–200 pmoles) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was introduced via an Amaxa Nucleofector (Koeln, Germany) into 1×106 UACC 903, UACC 903-GFP or C8161.Cl9 cells using Solution R/Program K-17 or WM35-GFP cells using NHEM-NEO Solution/Program U-20. Resulting transfection efficiency was ~99% ( 8 ). Duration of siRNA-mediated protein knockdown at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 d following nucleofection was measured for B-Raf or C-Raf by Western blot analysis. Cells used in reconstructed skin were nucleofected with buffer, siMutB-Raf (100, 50, or 12.5 pmoles), siC-Raf (100 pmoles), or scrambled (100 pmoles) siRNA, plated into culture dishes and 2 d later mixed with keratinocytes, which was added onto the dermis as detailed below.

Nanoliposomal-siRNA mediated protein knockdown 5×105 1205 Lu cells were plated in 6-well plates for 2 d and nanoliposomal-siMutB-Raf or -siScrambled complex (1?M) added. Protein lysates were collected 18 and 32 h later for Western blot analysis measuring B-Raf and Erk2 expression. Protein levels were quantified from three independent blots using ImageJ software, normalized to Erk2 and average B-Raf levels calculated ( 31 ).  Generation of skin containing melanocytic lesions To create skin in a culture dish, human fibroblasts, were trypsinized and resuspended in 10% reconstitution buffer, 10% 10× DMEM (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), 2.4 ?l/ml of 10 M NaOH, and 80% collagen I (BD, Bedford, MA) at a concentration of 2.5×105 cells/ml on ice ( 32 ).

Combination Index (CI) was calculated using the Chou-Talalay method with CalcuSyn software to establish mechanistic basis for cooperative inhibition mediated by siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 ( 35 ).  RESULTS Development of stable cationic nanoliposomes that load siRNA Since nanoliposomes have been reported as potential siRNA delivery vehicles, a number of possible formulations were evaluated and a novel DOTAP, DOPE and DSPE-PEG(2000) ratio of 4.75:4.75:0.5 was found to efficiently load siRNA. Loading was measured by adding Alexa Fluor 546 tagged siRNA to nanoliposomes at ratios of 1:5, 1:10, or 1:15 (siRNA: liposome, by weight) and complexed for 0.5, 3, or 6 h. Measuring free fluorescently tagged siRNA present in the gel or as a siRNA-liposome complex retained in the gel well was used to directly assess siRNA loading. A 1:5 ratio following 0.5 h incubation showed presence of both loaded and unloaded siRNA, which was in contrast to the 1:10 and 1:15 ratios where siRNA remained in gel wells indicating complete complexing with nanoliposomes ( Fig. 1A ; top left panel). Since maximal loading occurred following 30 m incubation at a 1:10 ratio, this siRNA-nanoliposomal complex formulation was used for subsequent experiments. Diameter of siRNA-liposome complexes one day after preparation was measured using dynamic light scattering, showing an average diameter of ~50 nm with a range of 34–67 nm ( Fig. 1A ; top right panel). Ghost nanoliposomes had a similar diameter averaging ~48 nm with a range of 32–64 nm. Thus, stable nanoliposomes were generated that loaded siRNA. siRNA in nanoliposomes is protected from serum degradation To evaluate the protective effects conferred by nanoliposomes on siRNA, fluorescently tagged free siRNA or siRNA-liposome complexes were exposed to 50% FBS, which is rich in RNA degrading factors, for 10, 30, 60, 180, or 360 m. Partial degradation of free siRNA was observed after 10 m and complete degradation at 60 m ( Fig. 1A ; lower left panel). In contrast, siRNA-nanoliposomal complexes remained in gel wells at all time points, indicating protection from degradation ( Fig. 1A ; lower middle panel). Half the original sample was treated with 0.5% SDS for 10 m, disrupting the complex and releasing siRNA, which was then run on an agarose gel. Similar levels of free siRNA were observed at all time points indicating protection by the complex ( Fig. 1A ; lower right panel). Thus, siRNA in nanoliposomes was protected from degradation by external factors. Nanoliposomal-siRNA complex is non-toxic and taken-up into the cytoplasm of normal as well as cancer cells To determine whether nanoliposomes mediated cellular uptake of siRNA, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and melanocytes were treated with ghost nanoliposomes or nanoliposomes containing Alexa 546-tagged siRNA (50, 100, or 200 nM). Fluorescence microscopy showed red Alexa fluorescence in ~100% of all cells indicating uptake of nanoliposomal siRNA ( Fig. 1B ). To verify siRNA was taken into the cytoplasm of cells, 1205 Lu cells were treated with 100 nM fluorescein-tagged siRNA-nanoliposomal complex or ghost nanoliposomes. Cells were then trypsinzed to remove cell surface bound nanoliposomes and replated overnight followed by fixation ( 36 ). Fluorescence microscopy showed presence of green fluorescein-tagged siRNA in cytoplasm of cells surrounding a nuclear shadow indicating nanoliposomal siRNA was internalized ( Fig. 1C ). In contrast, no green fluorescence was observed in cells treated with ghost nanoliposomes. Next, toxicity mediated by ghost nanoliposomes was examined in fibroblast, keratinocyte, melanocyte, or 1205 Lu melanoma cells. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of ghost nanoliposomes (12.5, 25, and 50 ?M) for 24 h and analyzed by MTS assay ( 37 ). Compared to untreated cells, no significant decrease in cellular viability was observed; indicating ghost nanoliposomes were not toxic at concentrations examined ( Fig. 1D ). Toxicity of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex was examined next in 1205 Lu cells comparing untreated cells to those treated with increasing concentrations of complex loaded with scrambled siRNA ( Fig. 1D ). No change in cell viability was observed indicating negligible toxicity. Thus, the siRNA-liposome complex was non-toxic and taken up into the cytoplasm of normal and cancer cells. siRNA targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf specifically decreases mutant but not wild-type protein expression in cells siRNA can be designed overlapping the T1799A mutation site of V600EB-Raf, which has potential to selectively decrease expression of mutant but not wild-type protein ( 8 , 10 , 30 ). To verify specificity of siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf, 100 pmoles (1 ?M) was nucleofected into melanoma cells containing mutant (UACC 903) or wild-type protein (C8161.Cl9). Western blot and densitometric analysis of cellular protein lysates showed that siRNA designed specifically against V600EB-Raf reduced protein levels ~50% in mutant UACC 903 ( Fig. 2A ) but not in wild-type B-Raf expressing C8161.Cl9 cells ( Fig. 2B ). In contrast, siRNA designed to sequences present in both mutant and wild-type B-Raf decreased protein expression by ~75% in both cell lines ( Figs. 2A & 2B ). Similarly, siRNA has been reported that specifically targets Akt3 but not Akt1 or Akt2 that can effectively decrease melanoma tumor development ( 6 ). Thus, siRNA designed to specifically inhibit mutant V600EB-Raf or Akt3 reduces expression of mutant but not wild-type B-Raf protein and Akt3 but not Akt1 or Akt2, respectively ( 6 ). siRNA targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf can be loaded into nanoliposomes, delivered into cells and decrease expression of mutant protein Having validated the specificity of siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3, 1?M siRNA was loaded into nanoliposomes and protein knockdown measured in 1205 Lu cells containing V600EB-Raf in three independent experiments by densitometric analysis and using Western blotting ( Fig. 2C ). Examples of protein knockdown at 18 and 32 h following a single treatment showed a 50–60% decrease of V600EB-Raf protein compared to cells treated with scrambled siRNA-nanoliposomal complex ( Fig. 2C ). Typically, protein knockdown ranged from 25–60% indicating some variability but knockdown was reproducibly observed. Duration of knockdown following a single siRNA treatment was measured by introducing siRNA into cells and using Western blotting to measure protein knockdown 2, 4, 6, and 8 days later. Western blots were densitometrically scanned and knockdown of B-Raf protein compared to control cells nucleofected with siRNA targeting C-Raf. A consistent ~60% decrease in protein expression was observed through day 8 ( Fig. 2D ). Thus, siRNA specific to V600EB-Raf can be loaded into cationic nanoliposomes, delivered into melanoma cells and decrease protein expression by 25–60% following a single treatment. Ultrasound treatment of laboratory-generated skin containing melanocytic lesions enables delivery of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex into tumors Skin forms a natural barrier preventing uptake of agents, including lipids and siRNA ( 19 , 21 ). Therefore, skin was permeabilized prior to addition of siRNA-liposomal complex using a lightweight four-cymbal array ultrasound developed originally to deliver insulin through skin and into the blood stream ( Fig. 3A ; left panel) ( 23 – 26 ). A representative exposimetry analysis showed a gaussian shaped peak field intensity with an overall spatial peak-temporal intensity of 50.6 ± 1.5 mW/cm2 ( Fig. 3A ; right panel). Possible skin damaged by ultrasound was evaluated on reconstructed skin treated with ultrasound for 20 m followed by addition of topically added ghost liposome for 1 h followed by fixation. H&E stained skin sections comparing untreated control to ultrasound and ghost liposome treated skin showed no detectable damage ( Fig. 3B ). Next, skin penetration by siRNA-nanoliposomal complex following ultrasound treatment was measured. Skin was ultrasound treated for 20 m followed by topical addition of liposome loaded with 1 ?M Alexa Fluor 546-tagged siRNA and 1-h later fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by analysis using fluorescence stereomicroscopy. Top down views of the skin showed uptake of red Alexa Fluor 546 tagged siRNA in both keratinocytes and UACC 903-GFP melanoma cells ( Fig. 3C ). Cross sections of skin showed presence of red Alexa Fluor 546 tagged siRNA in melanoma cells located in both epidermis and epidermal-dermal junction ( Fig. 3D ). Similar results were seen in skin reconstructs containing WM35-GFP (data not shown). Thus, permeabalizing skin using ultrasound prior to topical application of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex enabled delivery of siRNA to melanocytic lesions located within skin. Following ultrasound treatment, nanoliposomal complex containing siRNA targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf, inhibits melanocytic lesion development in skin reconstructs Effectiveness of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex for inhibiting early melanocytic skin lesions or cutaneous metastasis development, was examined by treating skin containing GFP tumors on alternate days with ultrasound for 20 m followed by addition of nanoliposomes containing siRNA to V600EB-Raf or ghost liposome ( Fig. 4A ). On day 21, stereo fluorescence microscopy was used to quantify average area occupied by GFP fluorescent skin lesions and compared to ultrasound + ghost liposome treated skin. A statistically significant 50–65% reduction in area occupied was observed for WM35-GFP ( Fig. 4B ) and UACC 903-GFP ( Fig. 4C ) tumor nodules (p<0.05; One-Way ANOVA). The WM35 cell line represents early non-invasive melanocytic lesions while UACC 903 cells represent invasive melanocytic lesions in the reconstructed skin model. Thus, siRNA mediated inhibition of V600EB-Raf decreased proliferative capacity of tumor cells reducing skin nodule development. Mechanistically, siRNA targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf decreases the proliferative potential of melanoma cell by inhibiting MAP kinase signaling in laboratory generated skin To establish the mechanistic basis by which siRNA-targeting V600EB-Raf inhibited melanoma development, siRNA was introduced into GFP-tagged WM35 or UACC 903 cells, which were seeded into the epidermis of reconstructed skin. 10 d later, skin was fixed and fluorescence microscopy used to quantify average area occupied by GFP expressing tumor nodules. Compared to cells nucleofected with buffer, scrambled or C-Raf siRNA, a 3–7-fold reduction in nodule development was observed by cells exposed to siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf ( Figs. 5A & 5B , One-Way ANOVA p<0.05). Knockdown of V600EB-Raf protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting of protein lysates collected following creation of reconstructed skin ( Figs. 5A & 5C ). Mechanism leading to decreased cutaneous tumor development was established by calculating in vitro doubling times as well as comparing differences in proliferation and measuring effect on MAP kinase signaling. siRNA-mediated inhibition of V600EB-Raf decreased mutant protein expression causing corresponding decreases in pMek and pErk as well as decreased cyclin D1 expression, indicating reduction in the proliferative signaling pathways of these cells ( Figs. 5A & 5C ). The doubling time of cultured cells containing siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf was found to be ~1.3 fold higher than control cells treated with buffer or scrambled siRNA ( Fig. 5D , left panel). Furthermore, a 4–5-fold decrease in proliferating cells was observed in tumor cells treated with siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf compared to control cells treated with C-Raf siRNA ( Fig. 5D , right panels). This growth inhibitory mechanism is consistent with prior reports ( 8 , 30 ). Thus, siRNA in nanoliposomes can decrease expression of V600EB-Raf protein, reducing MAP kinase signaling and the proliferative potential of melanoma cells. Following ultrasound treatment, siRNA-nanoliposomal complex targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf and Akt3 cooperatively decreased melanocytic lesion development in animal skin Effect of ultrasound followed by topical application of nanoliposomal-siRNA complex on melanoma development in animal skin was examined next. 1×106 UACC 903-GFP cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of nude mice and, under anesthesia, treated on alternate days at the tumor site with ultrasound for 15 m followed by topical application of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex ( Fig. 6A ). Along with measurement of tumor size ( Fig. 6B ), mice were weighed ( Fig. 6B , inset) on alternate days. Effect of liposomes containing siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf or Akt3 alone or V600EB-Raf and Akt3 together on tumor development were compared. Ghost liposomes were added to single treatments to compensate for differences in the amount of liposomal vehicle. A statistically significant ~30% reduction in tumor size was observed from d 15 in mice treated with complex containing siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf compared to animals exposed to complex containing scrambled siRNA ( Fig. 6B , p<0.05; Two-Way ANOVA). In contrast, no statistically significant difference was observed on cutaneous melanoma development following treatment with liposomes containing siRNA targeting Akt3 even though treated tumors were 10–15% smaller than controls treated with liposomes containing scrambled siRNA ( Fig. 6B , p>0.05; Two-Way ANOVA). Significantly, the combination treatment showed cooperatively acting tumor inhibition from d 11 when compared to siScrambled-liposomal complex ( Fig. 6B , p<0.05; Two-Way ANOVA). Weights were monitored on alternate days to ascertain weight-related toxicity ( Fig. 6B , inset). No differences were seen in weights indicating a lack of toxicity (Two-Way ANOVA, p>0.05). Lack of systemic toxicity was confirmed by analyzing blood for SGPT, SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, and glucose levels (data not shown), which showed no significant differences between animal groups (p>0.05; t-test). Additionally, no changes in liver morphology were detected in H&E stained sections (data not shown). Targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf and Akt3 leads to additively cooperative inhibition Since liposomal-mediated targeting of Akt3 and V600EB-Raf suggested cooperatively acting tumor inhibition, mechanistic basis for inhibition was determined. siRNA targeting Akt3 and/or V600EB-Raf was nucleofected into UACC 903 cells and effect on in vitro anchorage independent growth examined. For these studies and subsequent Chou-Talalay analysis for measuring the mechanistic basis underlying inhibition, Akt3 siRNA was maintained at 200 pmoles B-Raf siRNA was titrated at doses of 3, 6, and 12 pmoles. Simultaneous siRNA-mediated inhibition of Akt3 and B-Raf significantly decreased growth of cells compared to either Akt3 or B-Raf targeting alone ( Fig 6C , Lanes 3, 4 versus 7 , Lanes 3, 5 versus 8 and Lanes 3, 6 versus 9 ; One-Way ANOVA, p <0.05) ( 38 ). To establish whether growth inhibition would be additive or synergistic following simultaneous inhibition of Akt3 and V600EB-Raf, the Chou-Talalay method was used for determining the combination index (CI) using Calcusyn software ( 35 ). Using this approach, CI values < 0.9 are synergistic, > 1.1 is antagonistic, and values 0.9–1.1 are additive ( Fig. 6D ). The estimated CI values were 0.94, 0.97, and 1.10, for 3, 6, and 12 pmoles of B-Raf siRNA plus 200 pmoles of Akt3 siRNA, suggesting additive cooperation ( Fig. 6D ). Thus, targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 in culture or in animals should lead to cooperatively additive inhibition. However, tumor inhibition following liposome-mediated delivery of siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 in Fig. 6B seems to be more than additive suggesting it may tend towards being synergistic.  RESULTS Development of stable cationic nanoliposomes that load siRNA Since nanoliposomes have been reported as potential siRNA delivery vehicles, a number of possible formulations were evaluated and a novel DOTAP, DOPE and DSPE-PEG(2000) ratio of 4.75:4.75:0.5 was found to efficiently load siRNA. Loading was measured by adding Alexa Fluor 546 tagged siRNA to nanoliposomes at ratios of 1:5, 1:10, or 1:15 (siRNA: liposome, by weight) and complexed for 0.5, 3, or 6 h. Measuring free fluorescently tagged siRNA present in the gel or as a siRNA-liposome complex retained in the gel well was used to directly assess siRNA loading. A 1:5 ratio following 0.5 h incubation showed presence of both loaded and unloaded siRNA, which was in contrast to the 1:10 and 1:15 ratios where siRNA remained in gel wells indicating complete complexing with nanoliposomes ( Fig. 1A ; top left panel). Since maximal loading occurred following 30 m incubation at a 1:10 ratio, this siRNA-nanoliposomal complex formulation was used for subsequent experiments. Diameter of siRNA-liposome complexes one day after preparation was measured using dynamic light scattering, showing an average diameter of ~50 nm with a range of 34–67 nm ( Fig. 1A ; top right panel). Ghost nanoliposomes had a similar diameter averaging ~48 nm with a range of 32–64 nm. Thus, stable nanoliposomes were generated that loaded siRNA. siRNA in nanoliposomes is protected from serum degradation To evaluate the protective effects conferred by nanoliposomes on siRNA, fluorescently tagged free siRNA or siRNA-liposome complexes were exposed to 50% FBS, which is rich in RNA degrading factors, for 10, 30, 60, 180, or 360 m. Partial degradation of free siRNA was observed after 10 m and complete degradation at 60 m ( Fig. 1A ; lower left panel). In contrast, siRNA-nanoliposomal complexes remained in gel wells at all time points, indicating protection from degradation ( Fig. 1A ; lower middle panel). Half the original sample was treated with 0.5% SDS for 10 m, disrupting the complex and releasing siRNA, which was then run on an agarose gel. Similar levels of free siRNA were observed at all time points indicating protection by the complex ( Fig. 1A ; lower right panel). Thus, siRNA in nanoliposomes was protected from degradation by external factors. Nanoliposomal-siRNA complex is non-toxic and taken-up into the cytoplasm of normal as well as cancer cells To determine whether nanoliposomes mediated cellular uptake of siRNA, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and melanocytes were treated with ghost nanoliposomes or nanoliposomes containing Alexa 546-tagged siRNA (50, 100, or 200 nM). Fluorescence microscopy showed red Alexa fluorescence in ~100% of all cells indicating uptake of nanoliposomal siRNA ( Fig. 1B ). To verify siRNA was taken into the cytoplasm of cells, 1205 Lu cells were treated with 100 nM fluorescein-tagged siRNA-nanoliposomal complex or ghost nanoliposomes. Cells were then trypsinzed to remove cell surface bound nanoliposomes and replated overnight followed by fixation ( 36 ). Fluorescence microscopy showed presence of green fluorescein-tagged siRNA in cytoplasm of cells surrounding a nuclear shadow indicating nanoliposomal siRNA was internalized ( Fig. 1C ). In contrast, no green fluorescence was observed in cells treated with ghost nanoliposomes. Next, toxicity mediated by ghost nanoliposomes was examined in fibroblast, keratinocyte, melanocyte, or 1205 Lu melanoma cells. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of ghost nanoliposomes (12.5, 25, and 50 ?M) for 24 h and analyzed by MTS assay ( 37 ). Compared to untreated cells, no significant decrease in cellular viability was observed; indicating ghost nanoliposomes were not toxic at concentrations examined ( Fig. 1D ). Toxicity of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex was examined next in 1205 Lu cells comparing untreated cells to those treated with increasing concentrations of complex loaded with scrambled siRNA ( Fig. 1D ). No change in cell viability was observed indicating negligible toxicity. Thus, the siRNA-liposome complex was non-toxic and taken up into the cytoplasm of normal and cancer cells. siRNA targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf specifically decreases mutant but not wild-type protein expression in cells siRNA can be designed overlapping the T1799A mutation site of V600EB-Raf, which has potential to selectively decrease expression of mutant but not wild-type protein ( 8 , 10 , 30 ). To verify specificity of siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf, 100 pmoles (1 ?M) was nucleofected into melanoma cells containing mutant (UACC 903) or wild-type protein (C8161.Cl9). Western blot and densitometric analysis of cellular protein lysates showed that siRNA designed specifically against V600EB-Raf reduced protein levels ~50% in mutant UACC 903 ( Fig. 2A ) but not in wild-type B-Raf expressing C8161.Cl9 cells ( Fig. 2B ). In contrast, siRNA designed to sequences present in both mutant and wild-type B-Raf decreased protein expression by ~75% in both cell lines ( Figs. 2A & 2B ). Similarly, siRNA has been reported that specifically targets Akt3 but not Akt1 or Akt2 that can effectively decrease melanoma tumor development ( 6 ). Thus, siRNA designed to specifically inhibit mutant V600EB-Raf or Akt3 reduces expression of mutant but not wild-type B-Raf protein and Akt3 but not Akt1 or Akt2, respectively ( 6 ). siRNA targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf can be loaded into nanoliposomes, delivered into cells and decrease expression of mutant protein Having validated the specificity of siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3, 1?M siRNA was loaded into nanoliposomes and protein knockdown measured in 1205 Lu cells containing V600EB-Raf in three independent experiments by densitometric analysis and using Western blotting ( Fig. 2C ).

Duration of knockdown following a single siRNA treatment was measured by introducing siRNA into cells and using Western blotting to measure protein knockdown 2, 4, 6, and 8 days later. Western blots were densitometrically scanned and knockdown of B-Raf protein compared to control cells nucleofected with siRNA targeting C-Raf. A consistent ~60% decrease in protein expression was observed through day 8 ( Fig. 2D ). Thus, siRNA specific to V600EB-Raf can be loaded into cationic nanoliposomes, delivered into melanoma cells and decrease protein expression by 25–60% following a single treatment. Ultrasound treatment of laboratory-generated skin containing melanocytic lesions enables delivery of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex into tumors Skin forms a natural barrier preventing uptake of agents, including lipids and siRNA ( 19 , 21 ).

The WM35 cell line represents early non-invasive melanocytic lesions while UACC 903 cells represent invasive melanocytic lesions in the reconstructed skin model.

This growth inhibitory mechanism is consistent with prior reports ( 8 , 30 ). Thus, siRNA in nanoliposomes can decrease expression of V600EB-Raf protein, reducing MAP kinase signaling and the proliferative potential of melanoma cells. Following ultrasound treatment, siRNA-nanoliposomal complex targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf and Akt3 cooperatively decreased melanocytic lesion development in animal skin Effect of ultrasound followed by topical application of nanoliposomal-siRNA complex on melanoma development in animal skin was examined next. 1×106 UACC 903-GFP cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of nude mice and, under anesthesia, treated on alternate days at the tumor site with ultrasound for 15 m followed by topical application of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex ( Fig. 6A ). Along with measurement of tumor size ( Fig. 6B ), mice were weighed ( Fig. 6B , inset) on alternate days. Effect of liposomes containing siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf or Akt3 alone or V600EB-Raf and Akt3 together on tumor development were compared. Ghost liposomes were added to single treatments to compensate for differences in the amount of liposomal vehicle. A statistically significant ~30% reduction in tumor size was observed from d 15 in mice treated with complex containing siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf compared to animals exposed to complex containing scrambled siRNA ( Fig. 6B , p<0.05; Two-Way ANOVA).

To establish whether growth inhibition would be additive or synergistic following simultaneous inhibition of Akt3 and V600EB-Raf, the Chou-Talalay method was used for determining the combination index (CI) using Calcusyn software ( 35 ). Using this approach, CI values < 0.9 are synergistic, > 1.1 is antagonistic, and values 0.9–1.1 are additive ( Fig. 6D ). The estimated CI values were 0.94, 0.97, and 1.10, for 3, 6, and 12 pmoles of B-Raf siRNA plus 200 pmoles of Akt3 siRNA, suggesting additive cooperation ( Fig. 6D ). Thus, targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 in culture or in animals should lead to cooperatively additive inhibition. However, tumor inhibition following liposome-mediated delivery of siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 in Fig. 6B seems to be more than additive suggesting it may tend towards being synergistic.  Development of stable cationic nanoliposomes that load siRNA Since nanoliposomes have been reported as potential siRNA delivery vehicles, a number of possible formulations were evaluated and a novel DOTAP, DOPE and DSPE-PEG(2000) ratio of 4.75:4.75:0.5 was found to efficiently load siRNA.

Partial degradation of free siRNA was observed after 10 m and complete degradation at 60 m ( Fig. 1A ; lower left panel). In contrast, siRNA-nanoliposomal complexes remained in gel wells at all time points, indicating protection from degradation ( Fig. 1A ; lower middle panel). Half the original sample was treated with 0.5% SDS for 10 m, disrupting the complex and releasing siRNA, which was then run on an agarose gel. Similar levels of free siRNA were observed at all time points indicating protection by the complex ( Fig. 1A ; lower right panel).

Nanoliposomal-siRNA complex is non-toxic and taken-up into the cytoplasm of normal as well as cancer cells To determine whether nanoliposomes mediated cellular uptake of siRNA, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and melanocytes were treated with ghost nanoliposomes or nanoliposomes containing Alexa 546-tagged siRNA (50, 100, or 200 nM). Fluorescence microscopy showed red Alexa fluorescence in ~100% of all cells indicating uptake of nanoliposomal siRNA ( Fig. 1B ). To verify siRNA was taken into the cytoplasm of cells, 1205 Lu cells were treated with 100 nM fluorescein-tagged siRNA-nanoliposomal complex or ghost nanoliposomes. Cells were then trypsinzed to remove cell surface bound nanoliposomes and replated overnight followed by fixation ( 36 ). Fluorescence microscopy showed presence of green fluorescein-tagged siRNA in cytoplasm of cells surrounding a nuclear shadow indicating nanoliposomal siRNA was internalized ( Fig. 1C ). In contrast, no green fluorescence was observed in cells treated with ghost nanoliposomes. Next, toxicity mediated by ghost nanoliposomes was examined in fibroblast, keratinocyte, melanocyte, or 1205 Lu melanoma cells. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of ghost nanoliposomes (12.5, 25, and 50 ?M) for 24 h and analyzed by MTS assay ( 37 ). Compared to untreated cells, no significant decrease in cellular viability was observed; indicating ghost nanoliposomes were not toxic at concentrations examined ( Fig. 1D ). Toxicity of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex was examined next in 1205 Lu cells comparing untreated cells to those treated with increasing concentrations of complex loaded with scrambled siRNA ( Fig. 1D ). No change in cell viability was observed indicating negligible toxicity. Thus, the siRNA-liposome complex was non-toxic and taken up into the cytoplasm of normal and cancer cells.  Nanoliposomal-siRNA complex is non-toxic and taken-up into the cytoplasm of normal as well as cancer cells To determine whether nanoliposomes mediated cellular uptake of siRNA, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and melanocytes were treated with ghost nanoliposomes or nanoliposomes containing Alexa 546-tagged siRNA (50, 100, or 200 nM). Fluorescence microscopy showed red Alexa fluorescence in ~100% of all cells indicating uptake of nanoliposomal siRNA ( Fig. 1B ). To verify siRNA was taken into the cytoplasm of cells, 1205 Lu cells were treated with 100 nM fluorescein-tagged siRNA-nanoliposomal complex or ghost nanoliposomes. Cells were then trypsinzed to remove cell surface bound nanoliposomes and replated overnight followed by fixation ( 36 ). Fluorescence microscopy showed presence of green fluorescein-tagged siRNA in cytoplasm of cells surrounding a nuclear shadow indicating nanoliposomal siRNA was internalized ( Fig. 1C ). In contrast, no green fluorescence was observed in cells treated with ghost nanoliposomes. Next, toxicity mediated by ghost nanoliposomes was examined in fibroblast, keratinocyte, melanocyte, or 1205 Lu melanoma cells. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of ghost nanoliposomes (12.5, 25, and 50 ?M) for 24 h and analyzed by MTS assay ( 37 ).

Toxicity of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex was examined next in 1205 Lu cells comparing untreated cells to those treated with increasing concentrations of complex loaded with scrambled siRNA ( Fig. 1D ). No change in cell viability was observed indicating negligible toxicity. Thus, the siRNA-liposome complex was non-toxic and taken up into the cytoplasm of normal and cancer cells.  siRNA targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf specifically decreases mutant but not wild-type protein expression in cells siRNA can be designed overlapping the T1799A mutation site of V600EB-Raf, which has potential to selectively decrease expression of mutant but not wild-type protein ( 8 , 10 , 30 ). To verify specificity of siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf, 100 pmoles (1 ?M) was nucleofected into melanoma cells containing mutant (UACC 903) or wild-type protein (C8161.Cl9). Western blot and densitometric analysis of cellular protein lysates showed that siRNA designed specifically against V600EB-Raf reduced protein levels ~50% in mutant UACC 903 ( Fig. 2A ) but not in wild-type B-Raf expressing C8161.Cl9 cells ( Fig. 2B ). In contrast, siRNA designed to sequences present in both mutant and wild-type B-Raf decreased protein expression by ~75% in both cell lines ( Figs. 2A & 2B ). Similarly, siRNA has been reported that specifically targets Akt3 but not Akt1 or Akt2 that can effectively decrease melanoma tumor development ( 6 ). Thus, siRNA designed to specifically inhibit mutant V600EB-Raf or Akt3 reduces expression of mutant but not wild-type B-Raf protein and Akt3 but not Akt1 or Akt2, respectively ( 6 ).  siRNA targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf specifically decreases mutant but not wild-type protein expression in cells siRNA can be designed overlapping the T1799A mutation site of V600EB-Raf, which has potential to selectively decrease expression of mutant but not wild-type protein ( 8 , 10 , 30 ).

Examples of protein knockdown at 18 and 32 h following a single treatment showed a 50–60% decrease of V600EB-Raf protein compared to cells treated with scrambled siRNA-nanoliposomal complex ( Fig. 2C ). Typically, protein knockdown ranged from 25–60% indicating some variability but knockdown was reproducibly observed. Duration of knockdown following a single siRNA treatment was measured by introducing siRNA into cells and using Western blotting to measure protein knockdown 2, 4, 6, and 8 days later. Western blots were densitometrically scanned and knockdown of B-Raf protein compared to control cells nucleofected with siRNA targeting C-Raf. A consistent ~60% decrease in protein expression was observed through day 8 ( Fig. 2D ). Thus, siRNA specific to V600EB-Raf can be loaded into cationic nanoliposomes, delivered into melanoma cells and decrease protein expression by 25–60% following a single treatment.  siRNA targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf can be loaded into nanoliposomes, delivered into cells and decrease expression of mutant protein Having validated the specificity of siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3, 1?M siRNA was loaded into nanoliposomes and protein knockdown measured in 1205 Lu cells containing V600EB-Raf in three independent experiments by densitometric analysis and using Western blotting ( Fig. 2C ).

Ultrasound treatment of laboratory-generated skin containing melanocytic lesions enables delivery of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex into tumors Skin forms a natural barrier preventing uptake of agents, including lipids and siRNA ( 19 , 21 ). Therefore, skin was permeabilized prior to addition of siRNA-liposomal complex using a lightweight four-cymbal array ultrasound developed originally to deliver insulin through skin and into the blood stream ( Fig. 3A ; left panel) ( 23 – 26 ). A representative exposimetry analysis showed a gaussian shaped peak field intensity with an overall spatial peak-temporal intensity of 50.6 ± 1.5 mW/cm2 ( Fig. 3A ; right panel). Possible skin damaged by ultrasound was evaluated on reconstructed skin treated with ultrasound for 20 m followed by addition of topically added ghost liposome for 1 h followed by fixation. H&E stained skin sections comparing untreated control to ultrasound and ghost liposome treated skin showed no detectable damage ( Fig. 3B ). Next, skin penetration by siRNA-nanoliposomal complex following ultrasound treatment was measured. Skin was ultrasound treated for 20 m followed by topical addition of liposome loaded with 1 ?M Alexa Fluor 546-tagged siRNA and 1-h later fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by analysis using fluorescence stereomicroscopy. Top down views of the skin showed uptake of red Alexa Fluor 546 tagged siRNA in both keratinocytes and UACC 903-GFP melanoma cells ( Fig. 3C ). Cross sections of skin showed presence of red Alexa Fluor 546 tagged siRNA in melanoma cells located in both epidermis and epidermal-dermal junction ( Fig. 3D ). Similar results were seen in skin reconstructs containing WM35-GFP (data not shown). Thus, permeabalizing skin using ultrasound prior to topical application of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex enabled delivery of siRNA to melanocytic lesions located within skin.

Following ultrasound treatment, nanoliposomal complex containing siRNA targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf, inhibits melanocytic lesion development in skin reconstructs Effectiveness of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex for inhibiting early melanocytic skin lesions or cutaneous metastasis development, was examined by treating skin containing GFP tumors on alternate days with ultrasound for 20 m followed by addition of nanoliposomes containing siRNA to V600EB-Raf or ghost liposome ( Fig. 4A ). On day 21, stereo fluorescence microscopy was used to quantify average area occupied by GFP fluorescent skin lesions and compared to ultrasound + ghost liposome treated skin. A statistically significant 50–65% reduction in area occupied was observed for WM35-GFP ( Fig. 4B ) and UACC 903-GFP ( Fig. 4C ) tumor nodules (p<0.05; One-Way ANOVA). The WM35 cell line represents early non-invasive melanocytic lesions while UACC 903 cells represent invasive melanocytic lesions in the reconstructed skin model. Thus, siRNA mediated inhibition of V600EB-Raf decreased proliferative capacity of tumor cells reducing skin nodule development.

The WM35 cell line represents early non-invasive melanocytic lesions while UACC 903 cells represent invasive melanocytic lesions in the reconstructed skin model. Thus, siRNA mediated inhibition of V600EB-Raf decreased proliferative capacity of tumor cells reducing skin nodule development.  Mechanistically, siRNA targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf decreases the proliferative potential of melanoma cell by inhibiting MAP kinase signaling in laboratory generated skin To establish the mechanistic basis by which siRNA-targeting V600EB-Raf inhibited melanoma development, siRNA was introduced into GFP-tagged WM35 or UACC 903 cells, which were seeded into the epidermis of reconstructed skin. 10 d later, skin was fixed and fluorescence microscopy used to quantify average area occupied by GFP expressing tumor nodules. Compared to cells nucleofected with buffer, scrambled or C-Raf siRNA, a 3–7-fold reduction in nodule development was observed by cells exposed to siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf ( Figs. 5A & 5B , One-Way ANOVA p<0.05). Knockdown of V600EB-Raf protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting of protein lysates collected following creation of reconstructed skin ( Figs. 5A & 5C ). Mechanism leading to decreased cutaneous tumor development was established by calculating in vitro doubling times as well as comparing differences in proliferation and measuring effect on MAP kinase signaling. siRNA-mediated inhibition of V600EB-Raf decreased mutant protein expression causing corresponding decreases in pMek and pErk as well as decreased cyclin D1 expression, indicating reduction in the proliferative signaling pathways of these cells ( Figs. 5A & 5C ). The doubling time of cultured cells containing siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf was found to be ~1.3 fold higher than control cells treated with buffer or scrambled siRNA ( Fig. 5D , left panel). Furthermore, a 4–5-fold decrease in proliferating cells was observed in tumor cells treated with siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf compared to control cells treated with C-Raf siRNA ( Fig. 5D , right panels). This growth inhibitory mechanism is consistent with prior reports ( 8 , 30 ). Thus, siRNA in nanoliposomes can decrease expression of V600EB-Raf protein, reducing MAP kinase signaling and the proliferative potential of melanoma cells.  Mechanistically, siRNA targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf decreases the proliferative potential of melanoma cell by inhibiting MAP kinase signaling in laboratory generated skin To establish the mechanistic basis by which siRNA-targeting V600EB-Raf inhibited melanoma development, siRNA was introduced into GFP-tagged WM35 or UACC 903 cells, which were seeded into the epidermis of reconstructed skin. 10 d later, skin was fixed and fluorescence microscopy used to quantify average area occupied by GFP expressing tumor nodules.

Thus, siRNA in nanoliposomes can decrease expression of V600EB-Raf protein, reducing MAP kinase signaling and the proliferative potential of melanoma cells.  Following ultrasound treatment, siRNA-nanoliposomal complex targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf and Akt3 cooperatively decreased melanocytic lesion development in animal skin Effect of ultrasound followed by topical application of nanoliposomal-siRNA complex on melanoma development in animal skin was examined next. 1×106 UACC 903-GFP cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of nude mice and, under anesthesia, treated on alternate days at the tumor site with ultrasound for 15 m followed by topical application of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex ( Fig. 6A ). Along with measurement of tumor size ( Fig. 6B ), mice were weighed ( Fig. 6B , inset) on alternate days. Effect of liposomes containing siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf or Akt3 alone or V600EB-Raf and Akt3 together on tumor development were compared. Ghost liposomes were added to single treatments to compensate for differences in the amount of liposomal vehicle. A statistically significant ~30% reduction in tumor size was observed from d 15 in mice treated with complex containing siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf compared to animals exposed to complex containing scrambled siRNA ( Fig. 6B , p<0.05; Two-Way ANOVA). In contrast, no statistically significant difference was observed on cutaneous melanoma development following treatment with liposomes containing siRNA targeting Akt3 even though treated tumors were 10–15% smaller than controls treated with liposomes containing scrambled siRNA ( Fig. 6B , p>0.05; Two-Way ANOVA). Significantly, the combination treatment showed cooperatively acting tumor inhibition from d 11 when compared to siScrambled-liposomal complex ( Fig. 6B , p<0.05; Two-Way ANOVA). Weights were monitored on alternate days to ascertain weight-related toxicity ( Fig. 6B , inset). No differences were seen in weights indicating a lack of toxicity (Two-Way ANOVA, p>0.05). Lack of systemic toxicity was confirmed by analyzing blood for SGPT, SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, and glucose levels (data not shown), which showed no significant differences between animal groups (p>0.05; t-test). Additionally, no changes in liver morphology were detected in H&E stained sections (data not shown).  Following ultrasound treatment, siRNA-nanoliposomal complex targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf and Akt3 cooperatively decreased melanocytic lesion development in animal skin Effect of ultrasound followed by topical application of nanoliposomal-siRNA complex on melanoma development in animal skin was examined next. 1×106 UACC 903-GFP cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of nude mice and, under anesthesia, treated on alternate days at the tumor site with ultrasound for 15 m followed by topical application of siRNA-nanoliposomal complex ( Fig. 6A ).

Targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf and Akt3 leads to additively cooperative inhibition Since liposomal-mediated targeting of Akt3 and V600EB-Raf suggested cooperatively acting tumor inhibition, mechanistic basis for inhibition was determined. siRNA targeting Akt3 and/or V600EB-Raf was nucleofected into UACC 903 cells and effect on in vitro anchorage independent growth examined. For these studies and subsequent Chou-Talalay analysis for measuring the mechanistic basis underlying inhibition, Akt3 siRNA was maintained at 200 pmoles B-Raf siRNA was titrated at doses of 3, 6, and 12 pmoles. Simultaneous siRNA-mediated inhibition of Akt3 and B-Raf significantly decreased growth of cells compared to either Akt3 or B-Raf targeting alone ( Fig 6C , Lanes 3, 4 versus 7 , Lanes 3, 5 versus 8 and Lanes 3, 6 versus 9 ; One-Way ANOVA, p <0.05) ( 38 ). To establish whether growth inhibition would be additive or synergistic following simultaneous inhibition of Akt3 and V600EB-Raf, the Chou-Talalay method was used for determining the combination index (CI) using Calcusyn software ( 35 ). Using this approach, CI values < 0.9 are synergistic, > 1.1 is antagonistic, and values 0.9–1.1 are additive ( Fig. 6D ). The estimated CI values were 0.94, 0.97, and 1.10, for 3, 6, and 12 pmoles of B-Raf siRNA plus 200 pmoles of Akt3 siRNA, suggesting additive cooperation ( Fig. 6D ). Thus, targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 in culture or in animals should lead to cooperatively additive inhibition. However, tumor inhibition following liposome-mediated delivery of siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 in Fig. 6B seems to be more than additive suggesting it may tend towards being synergistic.  Targeting <sup>V600E</sup>B-Raf and Akt3 leads to additively cooperative inhibition Since liposomal-mediated targeting of Akt3 and V600EB-Raf suggested cooperatively acting tumor inhibition, mechanistic basis for inhibition was determined. siRNA targeting Akt3 and/or V600EB-Raf was nucleofected into UACC 903 cells and effect on in vitro anchorage independent growth examined.

Thus, targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 in culture or in animals should lead to cooperatively additive inhibition. However, tumor inhibition following liposome-mediated delivery of siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 in Fig. 6B seems to be more than additive suggesting it may tend towards being synergistic.  DISCUSSION Novel therapeutic regimens need development for treating early or cutaneous metastatic melanoma since aside from surgical excision, few treatment options are available ( 39 ). Current systemic therapeutics cause toxicities and have off-target effects ( 19 ). Topical or localized treatments of agents could permit use of high local concentrations with minimal toxicity and be useful for treating cutaneous lesions not amenable to surgical removal ( 19 , 40 ). A case in point is use of interlesional injections of IL-2, and electroporation for improved topical delivery of bleomycin for melanoma treatment ( 40 , 41 ). Effective topical agents could provide additional, currently unavailable, treatments options for patients with early or invasive cutaneous melanoma. The era of personalized, targeted cancer treatment is near, but specific proteins playing key roles in particular cancer types need identification and demonstration that simultaneous targeting inhibits tumor development in a synergistically acting manner. Thus study demonstrates that V600EB-Raf and Akt3 are two such targets in melanoma whose inhibition led to cooperative tumor inhibition. Furthermore, a novel approach has been developed for delivering therapeutic siRNA into early or invasive cutaneous melanocytic lesions targeting these important proteins. Ultrasound treatment of skin followed by topical application of nanoliposomes containing siRNA-targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 reduced expression of these proteins significantly decreasing melanoma development in a cooperatively additive manner. Simultaneous inhibition of the MAP and PI3 kinase pathways has previously been reported to enhance the inhibitory effect on both signaling cascades leading to increased tumor cell apoptosis, which supports the feasibility of this approach ( 47 – 49 ). Furthermore, siRNA-mediated inhibition of V600EB-Raf and Akt3 in aggressive melanoma cells has been shown to cooperatively inhibit tumor development through enhanced effects on the signaling cascades; specifically leading to decreased cyclin D1 expression as well as increased p27 and cleaved caspase-3 levels ( 9 ). These results are not surprising considering discoveries linking the two pathways in early melanoma development ( 9 ). Approximately 90% of nevi express V600EB-Raf but very few ever develop into melanoma due to the inhibitory effects associated with high MAP kinase pathway activity caused by the mutant protein. Akt3 has been shown to overcome this block by phosphorylating V600EB-Raf these melanocytes in order to lower activity of mutant protein and downstream MAP kinase pathway signaling to levels promoting rather than inhibiting melanoma development ( 9 ). Phosphorylation of V600EB-Raf enabled melanocytes to overcome the growth inhibitory effects associated with high pathway activity and to develop melanoma cell like characteristics ( 9 ). Thus, this discovery demonstrates that siRNA can be used as a therapeutic, specifically targeting multiple aberrantly expressed or mutant cancer causing genes without inhibiting activity of normal proteins to more effectively treat melanoma. Systemic administration of free unmodified siRNA by intravenous injection is not clinically feasible since serum factors rapidly degrade it preventing clinically useful concentrations from being reached ( 42 ). Development of novel vehicles for loading, protecting and delivering siRNA to distant sites around the body is one strategy ( 16 – 18 , 43 , 44 ). This study demonstrates that cationic nanoliposomes can load, protect and deliver therapeutic siRNA into melanoma cells. Nanoliposomes are taken up by all cell types but only effects those containing V600EB-Raf or overexpression of Akt3. Specificity of siRNA for its target reduces toxicity and potential side effects. Furthermore, use of pegylated lipids and small average nanoliposomal diameter of ~50 nm decreases immunological or inflammatory responses enabling the particles to bypass the reticulo-endothelial system ( 45 , 46 ). Ultrasound was used to permeabilize skin enabling delivery of siRNA-liposomal complex throughout epidermal and dermal layers since it had been reported to be effective for delivering various macromolecules into and throughout skin ( 19 , 21 – 26 ). A light-weight transducer with demonstrated capabilities of delivering insulin or antisense oligonucleotides into or through skin was used, showing that low-frequency ultrasound can permeabilize skin enabling delivery of nanoliposomal siRNA into melanoma cells residing at the dermal-epidermal junction to inhibit protein expression and melanoma development. Mechanistically, a therapeutic nanoliposomal-siRNA complex targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 can effectively decrease expression of both proteins and downstream signaling cascades to inhibit development or spread of cutaneous melanoma ( 8 , 10 , 30 ). Thus, use of a nanoliposomal-siRNA complex targeting these proteins could be used as a non-surgical approach to decrease number of benign moles or inhibit early cutaneous melanocytic lesions development ( 2 – 5 , 9 ). The latter would have the consequence of decreasing the spread at the earliest stages thereby prolonging survival by preventing metastases. Ultrasound in conjunction with a therapeutic topical nanoliposomal-siRNA complex targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 could also provide a treatment option for patients whose disease is not amenable to surgical removal or limb perfusion when widespread cutaneous lesions are present on the trunk. No therapeutic agents for treating these patients are available. Furthermore, advanced stage melanoma patients could benefit by administering these agents at the time of sentinel lymph node biopsy or surgery to target cells that may not have been removed during the procedure ( 50 ). Finally, this approach could be combined with more traditional therapeutic agents to improve clinical efficacy through synergistically acting mechanisms. In conclusion, topical delivery of cationic nanoliposomes loaded with siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 in combination with low-frequency ultrasound has potential to decrease early melanocytic lesion development in skin or prevent spread of cutaneous melanoma metastases.

Nanoliposomes are taken up by all cell types but only effects those containing V600EB-Raf or overexpression of Akt3. Specificity of siRNA for its target reduces toxicity and potential side effects. Furthermore, use of pegylated lipids and small average nanoliposomal diameter of ~50 nm decreases immunological or inflammatory responses enabling the particles to bypass the reticulo-endothelial system ( 45 , 46 ). Ultrasound was used to permeabilize skin enabling delivery of siRNA-liposomal complex throughout epidermal and dermal layers since it had been reported to be effective for delivering various macromolecules into and throughout skin ( 19 , 21 – 26 ). A light-weight transducer with demonstrated capabilities of delivering insulin or antisense oligonucleotides into or through skin was used, showing that low-frequency ultrasound can permeabilize skin enabling delivery of nanoliposomal siRNA into melanoma cells residing at the dermal-epidermal junction to inhibit protein expression and melanoma development. Mechanistically, a therapeutic nanoliposomal-siRNA complex targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 can effectively decrease expression of both proteins and downstream signaling cascades to inhibit development or spread of cutaneous melanoma ( 8 , 10 , 30 ). Thus, use of a nanoliposomal-siRNA complex targeting these proteins could be used as a non-surgical approach to decrease number of benign moles or inhibit early cutaneous melanocytic lesions development ( 2 – 5 , 9 ). The latter would have the consequence of decreasing the spread at the earliest stages thereby prolonging survival by preventing metastases. Ultrasound in conjunction with a therapeutic topical nanoliposomal-siRNA complex targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 could also provide a treatment option for patients whose disease is not amenable to surgical removal or limb perfusion when widespread cutaneous lesions are present on the trunk. No therapeutic agents for treating these patients are available. Furthermore, advanced stage melanoma patients could benefit by administering these agents at the time of sentinel lymph node biopsy or surgery to target cells that may not have been removed during the procedure ( 50 ). Finally, this approach could be combined with more traditional therapeutic agents to improve clinical efficacy through synergistically acting mechanisms. In conclusion, topical delivery of cationic nanoliposomes loaded with siRNA targeting V600EB-Raf and Akt3 in combination with low-frequency ultrasound has potential to decrease early melanocytic lesion development in skin or prevent spread of cutaneous melanoma metastases.
