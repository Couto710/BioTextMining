In-Depth Proteomics to Define the Cell Surface and Secretome of Ovarian Cancer Cells and Processes of Protein Shedding Current proteomics technologies allow substantial depth of analysis of cellular and subcellular proteomes as shown in the proteomic profiling of ovarian cancer cells. This in-depth analysis has elucidated the repertoire of proteins expressed on the cell surface and proteins released into the extracellular milieu, uncovering extensive shedding of extracellular domains of cell adhesion proteins and a highly dynamic protein secretion process. The protein sets identified provide a rich resource of potential circulating markers and targets for imaging and therapeutics for ovarian cancer.  Conclusion Challenges associated with the complexity of biological-fluid and tissue proteomes are gradually being overcome through advances in proteomic technologies. In-depth proteomic profiling of key compartments of ovarian cancer cells has yielded a rich data set of proteins that are secreted, shed, or remain attached to the cell surface. Several of these shed proteins represented cell adhesion molecules that play important roles in tumor adhesion and tumor metastasis. Deciphering the repertoire of secreted and shed proteins and of cell surface proteins that are resistant to shedding will yield biomarkers for diagnostics and targets for imaging and therapeutics.
