New Therapeutic Approaches for Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GISTs) Synopsis The management of advanced GIST is increasingly complex due to imatinib refractory disease. Primary resistance to imatinib is uncommon, and most patients progress after development of additional genetic changes. This article reviews management strategies including surgical approaches, local modalities for progressive liver metastases, as well as novel therapeutic agents.  Conclusion Prior to the advent of targeted therapy with imatinib, GIST patients who could not be surgically cured had a grim prognosis, since these tumors are resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Apart from its use in first-line treatment of metastatic GIST, imatinib is also being used in the adjuvant setting, where it has shown to prolong recurrence-free survival. Sunitinib is the only approved agent for second-line therapy. Primary and secondary resistance to these agents has been correlated to certain KIT and PDGFRA mutations. KIT and PDGFRA mutation testing is being incorporated in some big centers to guide therapy; escalating to high dose imatinib sooner for exon 9 mutations and opting for closer follow up for mutations unlikely to respond. The challenge for clinicians now is the approach to the patients with disease that is refractory to standard therapies. Several newer TKIs are currently under study and may have a role in the treatment of GIST. Among other agents being studied, the role of HSP-90 inhibitors is intriguing given that it utilizes a unique therapeutic mechanism. Also, clinical data for IGF-1R inhibitors is eagerly awaited given their potential role in patients with WT tumors. In the future treatment algorithms for GIST patients will change with the identification of tumor subtypes that respond better to one therapy than another.
