In vivo Angiotensin II AT 1 receptor blockade selectively inhibits LPS-induced innate immune response and ACTH release in rat pituitary gland Systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration induces an innate immune response and stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. We studied Angiotensin II AT1 receptor participation in the LPS effects with focus on the pituitary gland. LPS (50 ?g/kg, i.p.) enhanced, 3 hours after administration, gene expression of pituitary CD14 and that of Angiotensin II AT1A receptors in pituitary and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN); stimulated ACTH and corticosterone release; decreased pituitary CRF1 receptor mRNA and increased all plasma and pituitary pro-inflammatory factors studied. The AT1 receptor blocker (ARB) candesartan (1 mg/kg/day, s.c. daily for 3 days before LPS) blocked pituitary and PVN AT1 receptors, inhibited LPS-induced ACTH but not corticosterone secretion and decreased LPS-induced release of TNF-?, IL-1? and IL-6 to the circulation. The ARB reduced LPS-induced pituitary gene expression of IL-6, LIF, iNOS, COX-2 and I?B-?; and prevented LPS-induced increase of nNOS/eNOS activity. The ARB did not affect LPS-induced TNF-? and IL-1? gene expression, IL-6 or IL-1?protein content or LPS-induced decrease of CRF1 receptors. When administered alone, the ARB increased basal plasma corticosterone levels and basal PGE2 mRNA in pituitary. Our results demonstrate that the pituitary gland is a target for systemically administered LPS. AT1 receptor activity is necessary for the complete pituitary response to LPS and is limited to specific pro-inflammatory pathways. There is a complementary and complex influence of the PVN and circulating cytokines on the initial pituitary response to LPS. Our findings support the proposal that ARBs may be considered for the treatment of inflammatory conditions.  INTRODUCTION The response to infection is a combination of immune, hormonal and behavioral adaptive responses; these include increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, with effects in the periphery and the brain, HPA axis stimulation and sickness behavior ( Dantzer and Kelley, 2007 ; Dantzer et al., 2008 ). The balance between both systems helps to fight the infection and restore homeostasis ( Beishuizen and Thijs, 2004 ; Han and Ulevitch, 2005 ; Hopkins, 2007 ). However, when they become unrestricted or maladaptive, homeostasis is not achieved and pathological conditions arise ( Lawrence and Gilroy, 2007 ). A useful experimental model and an excellent example of the immune-endocrine relationship is the systemic administration of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS induces an innate immune response with a major upregulation of pro-inflammatory factors including enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production ( Han and Ulevitch, 2005 ; Rivest, 2003 ). This is accompanied by a classical stress response characterized by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ( Beishuizen and Thijs, 2004 ; Hopkins, 2007 ). During HPA axis activation, there is enhanced synthesis and release of hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) followed by an increase in pituitary ACTH formation and release, leading to augmented adrenal pro-inflammatory mineralocorticoid and anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid secretion ( Elenkov and Chrousos, 2006 ; Fernandes et al., 2008 ; Grinevich et al., 2001 ; Moncek et al., 2003 ). The pituitary gland is a critical component for the endocrine-immune response to infection, and is a target organ for LPS ( Denef, 2008 ; Lohrer et al., 2000 ; Quan et al., 1998 ; Ray and Melmed, 1997 ; Tierney et al., 2005 ; Wang et al., 1996 ; Whiteside et al., 1999 ; Wong et al., 1996 ). The pituitary ACTH release in response to infection and stress is regulated at three levels: a) by integrated inputs from the central nervous system, including a major role of hypothalamic CRF; b) by an intra-pituitary network of cytokines, prostaglandins and nitric oxide; and c) by influences from peripheral target tissues such as adrenal glucocorticoid feedback ( Denef, 2008 ; Ray and Melmed, 1997 ). The complex paracrine network of pituitary cells is of special interest for the present study. Endotoxin injection increases the synthesis of local pituitary pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) ( Lohrer et al., 2000 ; Tierney et al., 2005 ; Wang et al., 1996 ; Whiteside et al., 1999 ). LPS also up-regulates the synthesis of pituitary pro-inflammatory enzymes such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxidase synthase (iNOS) ( Quan et al., 1998 ; Wong et al., 1996 ). These pro-inflammatory components strongly affect the final pituitary output. For example, while IL-6, LIF and prostaglandins increase the ACTH release ( Auernhammer and Melmed, 2000 ; Denef, 2008 ; Gadek-Michalska and Bugajski, 2004 ; Ray and Melmed, 1997 ); TNF-? and NO may reduce it ( Gadek-Michalska and Bugajski, 2004 ; Gaillard et al., 1990 ; Spangelo et al., 1991 ; Uribe et al., 1999 ). The properties mentioned above make the pituitary gland an ideal site for integration of the immune and hormonal responses to inflammation. Pharmacological treatments to restore homeostasis following intense stress and inflammatory challenges are incomplete and have limitations ( Gilgun-Sherki et al., 2006 ). For these reasons the search for novel therapies to properly regulate the response to inflammation and stress is of great therapeutic importance. One such promising mechanism is the therapeutic modulation of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS). Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the active principle of RAS. It is now accepted that Ang II is a multitasking factor throughout the organism beyond its well known role in blood pressure control ( Saavedra et al., 2006b ). Of interest here are its pro-inflammatory effects and its contribution to stress-induced activation of the HPA axis ( Castren and Saavedra, 1988 , 1989 ; Marchesi et al., 2008 ; Saavedra and Benicky, 2007 ; Saavedra et al., 2006b ). Ang II elicits both its pro-inflammatory and pro-stress actions through stimulation of AT1 receptors ( Hunyady and Catt, 2006 ; Marchesi et al., 2008 ; Saavedra and Benicky, 2007 ). In rodents, the AT1 receptor type consists of AT1A and AT1B isoforms, differentially regulated but pharmacologically indistinguishable ( Inagami et al., 1994 ; Johren et al., 1995 ; Kakar et al., 1992 ; Kitami et al., 1992 ; Lenkei et al., 1999 ; Leong et al., 2002 ; Sanvitto et al., 1997 ; Shanmugam et al., 1994 ). The AT1A receptor subtype has been closely linked with both inflammation and stress ( Leong et al., 2002 ; Tsutsumi and Saavedra, 1991 ; Yang et al., 2005 ). Ang II AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs), drugs commonly used in the treatment of high blood pressure, reduce peripheral and cerebrovascular inflammation in hypertension ( Ando et al., 2004 ; Savoia and Schiffrin, 2006 ; Zhou et al., 2005 ); prevent stimulation of the HPA axis during isolation stress ( Armando et al., 2001 ); and reduce the central sympathetic stimulation of isolation and cold-restraint stress ( Armando et al., 2001 ; Bregonzio et al., 2003 ; Saavedra et al., 2006a ). The anti-inflammatory and anti-stress properties of ARBs suggested that these compounds could be effective in other inflammatory conditions. We recently found that the ARB candesartan, independently of its effects on blood pressure, reduced the LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines and their release to the general circulation; and it significantly reduced the inflammatory reaction to LPS in the adrenal gland ( Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2008 ) and spleen ( Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2009 ). The presence of an active local RAS system suggests that the pituitary may be a major target site for the modulation of endocrine and immune responses by Ang II. Previous studies have concluded that anterior pituitary AT1 receptors are an important factor in the regulation of the HPA axis during stress ( Leong et al., 2002 ; Saavedra, 1992 ). However, the role of pituitary AT1 receptors in the response to inflammation has not been studied. In the present study, we focused on the effects of LPS administration and ARB pre-treatment on the pituitary gland. We hypothesized that AT1 receptors participate in the pituitary inflammation and stress response induced by the endotoxin. To test our hypothesis we used the in vivo model of peripheral LPS administration to normotensive rats pre-treated with the ARB candesartan.  METHODS Experimental animals Male Wistar Hannover rats weighing 250 to 300 g were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY, USA). They were kept in groups of three per cage under standard laboratory conditions with water and rat chow ad libitum , room temperature at 22°C, and 12 hours of light each day. The NIMH Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering (NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NIH Publication No. 80–23, revised 1996). Treatment We performed five different experiments. For each experiment the animals were divided into four groups, 7 to 9 animals each: vehicle-saline, candesartan-saline, vehicle-LPS and candesartan-LPS. For 3 consecutive days, rats received s.c. injections of vehicle or candesartan (Astra-Zeneca, Molndal, Sweden) 1 mg/kg/day at 9:00 AM. This treatment produces a substantial increase in plasma renin activity and 50–70% decrease of AT1 receptor binding in different tissues ( Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2009 ; Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2008 ), indicating effective blockade of AT1 receptors. Candesartan was dissolved in 0.1 N Na2CO3 and further diluted in isotonic saline, at a final pH of 7.5–8.0. On day 3 starting at 10:00 AM, rats received an i.p. injection of LPS 50 ?g/kg ( Escherichia coli serotype 055:B5; Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO, USA) or sterile saline. Three hours after LPS/saline injection, animals were removed from their cages and taken to a different room to be killed by fast decapitation. Trunk blood was collected in polyethylene tubes with EDTA (1 mg/ml blood). The blood was immediately centrifuged at 1800 × g, 15 min at 4°C and the plasma obtained was stored at ?80°C until used. Pituitaries and brains were dissected, frozen in cold isopentane and stored at ?80°C until used. We selected a time point of three hours after LPS administration as the most convenient time for parallel determinations of circulating cytokines, gene expression and enzyme activities, based on our preliminary experiments and evidence from the literature ( Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2009 ; Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2008 ; Singh and Jiang, 2004 ; Uribe et al., 1999 ). Whole pituitaries from the first three experiments were used for real-time PCR, assay of NOS activity, and for determination of Ang II AT1 receptor binding, respectively. Brains from the third experiment were used to determine AT1 receptor mRNA, AT1 receptor binding and CRF mRNA in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Pituitaries from the fourth and fifth experiments were separated into anterior and posterior lobes under a dissecting microscope control. Cytokine protein concentration, ACTH content and PGE2 levels were measured in each lobe. Hormones Commercial radioimmunoassay kits were used to measure plasma corticosterone (MP Biomedicals, Orangeburg, NY, USA), and plasma ACTH (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN, USA) following the manufactures’ protocols. Anterior pituitaries were homogenized in 500 ?l of acetic acid 0.1 M and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g, 15 min at 4°C. Resultant clear supernatants were diluted 1:1,000 in the radioimmunoassay buffer and used to quantify ACTH (Bachem, San Carlos, CA, USA). PGE<sub>2</sub> PGE2 in pituitary was measured by enzyme immunoassay using a commercial kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Anterior and posterior pituitaries were separated, homogenized in 500 ?l of acetic acid 0.1 M and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g, 15 min at 4°C. Clear supernatants were further diluted 1:8 in the reaction buffer for a final pH ~7.0. Cytokine assays Commercial ELISA kits were used to measure plasma TNF-?, IL-1? and IL-6; and pituitary IL-1? and IL-6 (R&D Systems). The manufacturer directions were followed for plasma samples. Anterior and posterior pituitaries were separated and homogenized in 500 ?l of Tris-HCl pH 7.4 containing a protease inhibitors cocktail (Complete®, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Clear supernatants from centrifugation at 10,000 × g, 15 min at 4°C were used for analysis. Measurement of mRNA expression by real-time PCR Total RNA was isolated individually from homogenized pituitary samples using 500 ?l TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by purification using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA) was performed using 2 ?g of total RNA and Super-Script III first-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed in a 20 ?l reaction mixture consisting of 10 ?l SYBR Green PCR Mas ter Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 2 ?l cDNA and 0.3 ?M of each primer for a specific target on a DNA Engine Opticon™ (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Specific primers used are listed in Table 1 . Amplification was performed at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and 56 – 60°C for 60 sec. At the end of amplification, the specificity of the PCR was confirmed by determination of the melting temperature of the PCR product. Serial dilutions of rat cDNA were used to obtain a calibration curve. The individual targets for each sample were quantified by determining the cycle threshold and by using calibration curves. The relative amount of the target RNA was normalized with the housekeeping gene for 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and expressed as arbitrary units. The expression of 18S rRNA was not affected by any of the treatments used (results not shown). NOS activity Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was determined using a commercial kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) based on the conversion of L-[3H]-arginine to L-[3H]-citrulline. 50 ?g of protein were incubated 45 min at 37°C in the incubation buffer enriched with NADPH 1 mM (Sigma Chemical Co.), L-[2,3,4,5 3H]-arginine 0.2 ?Ci per sample (~60 nM; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and L-Arginine 10 ?M (Sigma Chemical Co.). Under these conditions the enzymatic conversion was linear. The difference of L-[3H]-citrulline generated in the presence and absence of Ca2+ was defined as eNOS/nNOS activity. The difference of L-[3H]-citrulline generated in Ca2+-free conditions and in the presence of the NOS inhibitor L-NNA 1 mM was defined as iNOS activity. NOS activity was expressed as pmol/min/mg protein. Receptor autoradiography Sarcosine1-Angiotensin II (Sar1-Ang II; Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA, USA) was iodinated by the Peptide Radioiodination Service Center (School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, MS, USA) with a specific activity of ~2200 Ci/mmol. Consecutive 16 ?m thick pituitary and brain sections containing the hypothalamic PVN were cut using a cryostat at ?20°C. Sections were thaw-mounted on Superfrost/plus slides (Daigger, Vernon Hills, IL, USA), dried overnight at 4°C and then stored at ?80°C until used. Sections were preincubated for 15 min at 22°C in a 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.005% bacitracin, 5 mM Na2EDTA, 120 mM NaCl and 0.2% proteinase-free bovine serum albumin. Sections were then incubated for 2 h at 22°C in fresh buffer containing 0.5 nM [125I]Sar1-Ang II. To characterize Ang II receptor subtypes, adjacent tissue sections were incubated as above in the presence of either 10 ?M losartan (DuPont Merck, Wilmington, DE, USA), a selective AT1 receptor antagonist, or 10 ?M PD123319 (Parke-Davis, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), a selective AT2 receptor ligand, or 5 ?M unlabeled Ang II (Peninsula Laboratories) to assess nonspecific binding. The number of AT1 receptors was determined as the specific binding displaced by unlabeled losartan. The number of AT2 receptors was determined as the specific binding displaced by unlabeled PD123319. After incubation, slides were washed 4 times for 1 min in Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at 4°C, followed by a 30-second rinse in distilled water at 4°C. Slides were then dried under a stream of cold air and exposed to Biomax MR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA). Optical densities of autoradiograms generated by incubation with the 125I ligand were normalized after comparison with [14C]microscale standards as described and quantified by computerized densitometry using the Scion Image 4.0.2 Program (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA) based on the NIH Image Program of the National Institutes of Health. Binding signal was expressed as fmol/mg of protein. Measurement of mRNA expression by in situ hybridization Consecutive 16 ?m thick sections of hypothalamic PVN were cut using a cryostat at ?20°C. Sections were thaw-mounted on Superfrost/plus slides, dried for 5 min at 50°C and then stored at ?80°C. AT<sub>1A</sub> receptor In situ hybridization was performed using [35S]-labeled antisense and sense riboprobes for AT1A receptors as described ( Johren et al., 1995 ). Prior to use, the sections on slides were warmed in a desiccator at room temperature and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate buffer for 10 min. After two washes in phosphate buffer, they were acetylated for 10 min in 0.1 M triethanolamine HCl, 0.9% NaCl, containing 0.25% acetic anhydride, delipidated in ethanol and chloroform, and air-dried. Each slide with sections was covered with 150 ?l hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide, 0.3 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1X Denhardt’s solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 100 ?g/ml salmon testes DNA,250 ?g/ml yeast RNA, 250 ?g/ml yeast tRNA, 150 mM DTT, 0.2% SDS, 0.2% sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate and 2 × 107 cpm/ml sense or antisense probe. After hybridization for 18 h at 54°C, the coverslips were removed and the sections were rinsed several times in 4X standard saline citrate (SSC). Non-hybridized probes were digested by incubation with 40 ?g/ml RNase A (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 30 min at 37°C. After a final high stringency wash in 0.1X SSC at 65°C for 60 min, sections were dehydrated in graded ethanol containing 0.3 M ammonium acetate, air dried and exposed to Biomax MR film (Kodak) for 11 days. CRF 42-mer sense and antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized for the rat CRF cDNA sequence localized in nucleotides 672–713 (GeneDetect, Bradenton, FL, USA, Cat#: GD2031-OP, Rat). Labeling was performed using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) to a specific activity of 3–4 × 108 cpm/?g. Each reaction was performed with 10 pmoles of oligonucleotides in the presence of 200 ?Ci of [?-35S]ATP (NEN/Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The labeled oligonucleotides were separated from unincorporated nucleotides using ProbeQuant G-50 Micro columns (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). In situ hybridization of rat brain sections and post-hybridization washings were performed as described in manufacturer’s protocol. Dried hybridized sections were exposed to Biomax MR film (Kodak) for 5 days. The films generated as described were used to analyze the mRNA expression by measuring optical film densities using the Scion Image 4.0.2 Program (Scion Corporation). The intensities of the hybridization signals were expressed as nCi/g tissue equivalent after calibration with [14C]-microscales standards ( Miller, 1991 ), and after subtraction of the values obtained in the same areas of adjacent sections hybridized with sense (control) probes, which represent nonspecific hybridization. Statistical analysis All results are expressed as means ± SEM, for groups of 7–9 animals measured individually. Unpaired t test was used to analyze the results of plasma cytokines, posterior pituitary IL-6 protein and pituitary iNOS activity, experiments where saline control groups were not detectable. For the rest of results, one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Newman-Keuls’ test were used to assess the significance of differences. Degrees of freedom for t tests were 16 and for ANOVA were 3,28. P <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All statistics were performed with the use of Prism 3.03 software (GraphPad Software for Science, San Diego, CA, USA).

After a final high stringency wash in 0.1X SSC at 65°C for 60 min, sections were dehydrated in graded ethanol containing 0.3 M ammonium acetate, air dried and exposed to Biomax MR film (Kodak) for 11 days. CRF 42-mer sense and antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized for the rat CRF cDNA sequence localized in nucleotides 672–713 (GeneDetect, Bradenton, FL, USA, Cat#: GD2031-OP, Rat). Labeling was performed using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) to a specific activity of 3–4 × 108 cpm/?g. Each reaction was performed with 10 pmoles of oligonucleotides in the presence of 200 ?Ci of [?-35S]ATP (NEN/Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The labeled oligonucleotides were separated from unincorporated nucleotides using ProbeQuant G-50 Micro columns (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). In situ hybridization of rat brain sections and post-hybridization washings were performed as described in manufacturer’s protocol. Dried hybridized sections were exposed to Biomax MR film (Kodak) for 5 days. The films generated as described were used to analyze the mRNA expression by measuring optical film densities using the Scion Image 4.0.2 Program (Scion Corporation). The intensities of the hybridization signals were expressed as nCi/g tissue equivalent after calibration with [14C]-microscales standards ( Miller, 1991 ), and after subtraction of the values obtained in the same areas of adjacent sections hybridized with sense (control) probes, which represent nonspecific hybridization.  AT<sub>1A</sub> receptor In situ hybridization was performed using [35S]-labeled antisense and sense riboprobes for AT1A receptors as described ( Johren et al., 1995 ). Prior to use, the sections on slides were warmed in a desiccator at room temperature and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate buffer for 10 min. After two washes in phosphate buffer, they were acetylated for 10 min in 0.1 M triethanolamine HCl, 0.9% NaCl, containing 0.25% acetic anhydride, delipidated in ethanol and chloroform, and air-dried. Each slide with sections was covered with 150 ?l hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide, 0.3 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1X Denhardt’s solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 100 ?g/ml salmon testes DNA,250 ?g/ml yeast RNA, 250 ?g/ml yeast tRNA, 150 mM DTT, 0.2% SDS, 0.2% sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate and 2 × 107 cpm/ml sense or antisense probe. After hybridization for 18 h at 54°C, the coverslips were removed and the sections were rinsed several times in 4X standard saline citrate (SSC). Non-hybridized probes were digested by incubation with 40 ?g/ml RNase A (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 30 min at 37°C.

Statistical analysis All results are expressed as means ± SEM, for groups of 7–9 animals measured individually. Unpaired t test was used to analyze the results of plasma cytokines, posterior pituitary IL-6 protein and pituitary iNOS activity, experiments where saline control groups were not detectable. For the rest of results, one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Newman-Keuls’ test were used to assess the significance of differences. Degrees of freedom for t tests were 16 and for ANOVA were 3,28. P <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All statistics were performed with the use of Prism 3.03 software (GraphPad Software for Science, San Diego, CA, USA).  RESULTS Cytokines in plasma Basal TNF-?, IL-1? and IL-6 plasma levels were not detectable in vehicle-treated rats ( Fig. 1 ). LPS induced TNF-?, IL-1? and IL-6 release to the circulation when determined three hours after endotoxin administration ( Fig. 1 ). When administered alone, the ARB did not influence plasma levels of any of the cytokine studied. However, the ARB reduced the LPS-induced release of TNF-? by 66% ( p <0.05), IL-1? by 45% ( p <0.05) and IL-6 by 83% ( p <0.01; Fig. 1 ). AT<sub>1</sub> receptor transcription and expression in the hypothalamic PVN In vehicle-treated rats, we found high AT1A mRNA expression and high AT1 receptor binding in the PVN, with a predominant concentration in the parvocellular area ( Fig. 2 ). LPS induced an over 2-fold increase of AT1A receptor mRNA in the PVN ( p <0.05); without changes in AT1 receptor binding ( Fig. 2 ). Treatment with the ARB did not alter the LPS-induced increase of AT1A gene expression but significantly blocked AT1 PVN receptors by over 50% ( p <0.001), both in vehicle-treated and LPS-treated rats ( Fig. 2 ). CRF transcription in the hypothalamic PVN In vehicle-treated rats, there was high CRF mRNA expression in the PVN, localized in the parvocellular area ( Fig. 3A ). Neither LPS nor candesartan administration affected CRF gene expression in the PVN ( Fig. 3A ). CRF<sub>1</sub> and CRF<sub>2</sub> receptor mRNA in pituitary gland Both CRF1 and CRF2 receptor mRNA were expressed in the pituitary gland of vehicle-treated rats ( Fig 3B ). LPS administration reduced CRF1 receptor transcription by 70% ( p <0.001) without effect on CRF2 receptor transcription ( Fig. 3B ). Candesartan treatment did not modify the LPS-induced decrease of CRF1 receptor mRNA or CRF2 mRNA expression ( Fig. 3B ). RAS expression in pituitary We found large numbers of AT1 receptors in the anterior pituitary ( Fig. 4 ) but no AT2 receptors (data not shown). We detected mRNA for both subtypes of Ang II AT1 receptors, AT1A and AT1B ( Fig. 4A ), and for renin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensinogen ( Table 2 ). LPS increased mRNA expression of AT1A receptors ( p <0.05) and did not alter AT1 receptor binding ( Fig. 4 ). In addition, LPS did not modify mRNA expression of AT1B, renin, ACE or angiotensinogen ( Fig. 4A and Table 2 ). Candesartan did not modify the gene expression of any of the RAS components studied either in vehicle-treated rats or after LPS administration ( Fig. 4 and Table 2 ). AT1 receptor binding was decreased by 70% after candesartan administration ( p <0.001) in both saline and LPS treated animals ( Fig. 4B ). Expression of LPS receptor and recognition protein in pituitary We detected mRNA for the LPS recognition protein CD14 and the LPS receptor TLR4 ( Fig. 5 ). LPS administration selectively stimulated CD14 mRNA expression ( p <0.01), but did not modify the mRNA expression of TLR4 ( Fig. 5 ). Candesartan did not change the mRNA expression of CD14 or TLR4, either under control conditions or after LPS administration ( Fig. 5 ). Gene expression and content of pituitary cytokines We studied the mRNA expression of TNF-?, IL-6, IL-1?, LIF and MIF in the whole pituitary 3 h after LPS injection ( Fig. 6 ). LPS administration increased mRNA expression of TNF-? by 2.5-fold ( p <0.05), IL-6 by 34-fold ( p <0.001), IL-1? by 17-fold ( p <0.001), and LIF by 47-fold ( p <0.01). Candesartan alone did not affect the basal mRNA expression of any cytokine studied ( Fig. 6 ). The ARB pre-treatment selectively inhibited the LPS-induced gene expression of IL-6 (62%; p <0.001) and LIF (74%; p <0.01) without affecting the LPS induction of TNF-?or IL-1? Fig. 6 ). MIF mRNA expression was not affected by any of the treatments. We measured the IL-6 and IL-1? protein expression in pituitaries dissected into anterior and posterior lobes. LPS administration significantly increased IL-6 and IL-1? protein content in both anterior and posterior pituitaries ( p <0.05; Fig. 7 ). Relatively higher increase in IL-6 content was found in the anterior pituitary when compared to the posterior lobe, while the increase in IL-1? content was higher in the posterior pituitary when compared to the anterior lobe ( Fig. 7 ). The ARB did not affect cytokine content under basal or LPS-stimulated conditions ( Fig. 7 ). Pituitary gene expression and activity of NOS isoenzymes LPS up-regulated iNOS mRNA expression by 37-fold ( p <0.001; Fig. 8A ), and increased Ca2+-independent iNOS activity from non-detectable to significant levels in the whole pituitary ( Fig. 8B ). LPS down-regulated eNOS and nNOS mRNA expression by 40 to 50% ( p <0.05; Fig. 8A ) and increased the Ca2+-dependent eNOS/nNOS activity about 5-fold ( p <0.05; Fig. 8B ). Candesartan alone did not affect the basal gene expression or enzyme activity of any of the NOS isoenzymes ( Fig. 8 ). The ARB pretreatment significantly reduced the LPS-induced increase in iNOS gene expression ( p <0.01), but did not affect the LPS-induced upregulation of iNOS activity ( Fig. 8 ). Conversely, the ARB did not affect the increase in eNOS or nNOS mRNA expression produced by LPS, but completely prevented the LPS-induced increase in eNOS/nNOS activity ( p <0.05; Fig. 8 ). Pituitary COX mRNA expression and PGE<sub>2</sub> content In the whole pituitary, LPS down-regulated cyclooxigenase-1 (COX-1) mRNA by 53% ( p <0.01); and conversely, up-regulated COX-2 mRNA 2-fold ( p <0.05; Fig. 9A ). However, LPS did not change PGE2 content, a measure of COX-2 activity, either in the anterior or in the posterior pituitary ( Fig. 9B ). The ARB decreased the basal COX-1 mRNA expression by 29% ( p <0.05) but did not significantly influence basal COX-2 mRNA ( Fig. 9A ). Conversely, the ARB did not significantly alter the LPS-induced decrease in COX-1 mRNA expression but significantly reduced the LPS-induced up-regulation of COX-2 by 60% ( p <0.05). In addition, the ARB reduced anterior and posterior pituitary PGE2 content in control rats, and the PGE2 content in the anterior pituitary of LPS-treated rats ( p <0.05; Fig. 9B ). Expression of early transcription factor genes in pituitary LPS administration increased mRNA expression of I?B-? by 3.6-fold ( p <0.001; Fig. 10 ), and this was significantly reduced (54%) by the ARB ( p <0.01; Fig. 9 ). Neither the LPS nor the ARB significantly affected the c-fos gene expression ( Fig. 10 ). Circulating and pituitary ACTH content LPS administration markedly enhanced circulating ACTH ( p <0.001) and corticosterone ( p <0.001; Fig 11A ), and decreased the ACTH content in the anterior pituitary ( p <0.05; Fig. 11B ). The ARB reduced the LPS-induced increase in circulating ACTH by 40% ( p <0.05), but was without effect on the LPS-induced enhanced circulating corticosterone or in the pituitary ACTH content ( Fig. 11 ). In addition, the ARB significantly increased circulating corticosterone levels in control rats not treated with LPS ( p <0.05; Fig. 11A ).  RESULTS Cytokines in plasma Basal TNF-?, IL-1? and IL-6 plasma levels were not detectable in vehicle-treated rats ( Fig. 1 ).

Pituitary COX mRNA expression and PGE<sub>2</sub> content In the whole pituitary, LPS down-regulated cyclooxigenase-1 (COX-1) mRNA by 53% ( p <0.01); and conversely, up-regulated COX-2 mRNA 2-fold ( p <0.05; Fig. 9A ). However, LPS did not change PGE2 content, a measure of COX-2 activity, either in the anterior or in the posterior pituitary ( Fig. 9B ). The ARB decreased the basal COX-1 mRNA expression by 29% ( p <0.05) but did not significantly influence basal COX-2 mRNA ( Fig. 9A ). Conversely, the ARB did not significantly alter the LPS-induced decrease in COX-1 mRNA expression but significantly reduced the LPS-induced up-regulation of COX-2 by 60% ( p <0.05). In addition, the ARB reduced anterior and posterior pituitary PGE2 content in control rats, and the PGE2 content in the anterior pituitary of LPS-treated rats ( p <0.05; Fig. 9B ).  Pituitary COX mRNA expression and PGE<sub>2</sub> content In the whole pituitary, LPS down-regulated cyclooxigenase-1 (COX-1) mRNA by 53% ( p <0.01); and conversely, up-regulated COX-2 mRNA 2-fold ( p <0.05; Fig. 9A ). However, LPS did not change PGE2 content, a measure of COX-2 activity, either in the anterior or in the posterior pituitary ( Fig. 9B ). The ARB decreased the basal COX-1 mRNA expression by 29% ( p <0.05) but did not significantly influence basal COX-2 mRNA ( Fig. 9A ). Conversely, the ARB did not significantly alter the LPS-induced decrease in COX-1 mRNA expression but significantly reduced the LPS-induced up-regulation of COX-2 by 60% ( p <0.05). In addition, the ARB reduced anterior and posterior pituitary PGE2 content in control rats, and the PGE2 content in the anterior pituitary of LPS-treated rats ( p <0.05; Fig. 9B ).  Expression of early transcription factor genes in pituitary LPS administration increased mRNA expression of I?B-? by 3.6-fold ( p <0.001; Fig. 10 ), and this was significantly reduced (54%) by the ARB ( p <0.01; Fig. 9 ). Neither the LPS nor the ARB significantly affected the c-fos gene expression ( Fig. 10 ).  Expression of early transcription factor genes in pituitary LPS administration increased mRNA expression of I?B-? by 3.6-fold ( p <0.001; Fig. 10 ), and this was significantly reduced (54%) by the ARB ( p <0.01; Fig. 9 ). Neither the LPS nor the ARB significantly affected the c-fos gene expression ( Fig. 10 ).  Circulating and pituitary ACTH content LPS administration markedly enhanced circulating ACTH ( p <0.001) and corticosterone ( p <0.001; Fig 11A ), and decreased the ACTH content in the anterior pituitary ( p <0.05; Fig. 11B ). The ARB reduced the LPS-induced increase in circulating ACTH by 40% ( p <0.05), but was without effect on the LPS-induced enhanced circulating corticosterone or in the pituitary ACTH content ( Fig. 11 ). In addition, the ARB significantly increased circulating corticosterone levels in control rats not treated with LPS ( p <0.05; Fig. 11A ).  Circulating and pituitary ACTH content LPS administration markedly enhanced circulating ACTH ( p <0.001) and corticosterone ( p <0.001; Fig 11A ), and decreased the ACTH content in the anterior pituitary ( p <0.05; Fig. 11B ). The ARB reduced the LPS-induced increase in circulating ACTH by 40% ( p <0.05), but was without effect on the LPS-induced enhanced circulating corticosterone or in the pituitary ACTH content ( Fig. 11 ). In addition, the ARB significantly increased circulating corticosterone levels in control rats not treated with LPS ( p <0.05; Fig. 11A ).  DISCUSSION Our results demonstrate that: a) the pituitary gland is a target for systemically administered LPS; b) the AT1 receptor activity is necessary for the complete pituitary response to the endotoxin; c) the role of AT1 receptors in the pituitary gland appears to be limited to specific LPS-responsive pro-inflammatory pathways; d) the influence of the PVN on the initial pituitary response to LPS is complex and not completely clarified; e) circulating cytokines may play a role in the regulation of the pituitary response to LPS. Effects of LPS and the ARB on circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines The selectivity of the ARB effects on pro-inflammatory cytokines in the pituitary contrasts with its systemic effects. We confirmed the increase in circulating cytokines as a consequence of LPS administration, and the significant reduction in cytokine levels after ARB treatment ( McAleer and Vella, 2008 ; Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2009 ). The contribution of the pituitary gland to circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines is very small, and candesartan effects should be interpreted as the consequence of a reduction of the systemic inflammatory response, rather than of direct effects in the pituitary ( Hoch et al., 2009 ; Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2009 ). Effects of LPS and ARB treatment on the hypothalamic PVN The central response to endothoxin is most probably a combination of stimulation of circumventricular organs, vagal afferents, perivascular macrophages and endothelial cells, leading to increased hypothalamic CRF synthesis and release ( Dantzer et al., 2008 ). We focused on the role of AT1A receptors in the PVN, upregulated in immobilization and isolation stress, and a powerful factor regulating CRF production and release ( Armando et al., 2007 ; Castren and Saavedra, 1988 , 1989 ; Jezova et al., 1998 ; Leong et al., 2002 ). Increased PVN AT1A receptor transcription following inflammatory stress strongly suggests that receptor upregulation is an important component of the HPA axis stimulation. The early phase of inflammatory HPA axis stimulation was not associated with increased AT1 receptor expression, in agreement with earlier results demonstrating that enhanced receptor expression requires prolonged or repeated stress ( Armando et al., 2007 ; Castren and Saavedra, 1988 ; Jezova et al., 1998 ; Leong et al., 2002 ). In association with increased AT1A receptor transcription, LPS induced pituitary CRF1 receptor downregulation, decreased pituitary ACTH content, and increased plasma ACTH and corticosterone, unequivocal indication of CRF release ( Aguilera et al., 2004 ; Pozzoli et al., 1996 ). The LPS effects occurred with no detectable influence on CRF synthesis. We interpret our results as a consequence of the subseptic dose of LPS administered, inducing CRF release with no detectable effect on its synthesis ( Loum-Ribot et al., 2006 ), while septic doses of LPS are able to increase both CRF synthesis and release ( Grinevich et al., 2001 ; Loum-Ribot et al., 2006 ; Rivest and Laflamme, 1995 ). ARB treatment drastically decreased PVN AT1A receptor binding, verification of central receptor blockade following peripheral ARB administration ( Nishimura et al., 2000 ), and significantly reduced LPS-induced ACTH release from the pituitary gland, indirect evidence of blockade of CRF release. However, the ARB did not modify the selective downregulation of pituitary CRF1 receptors. The LPS increase in corticosterone release was not reduced by the ARB, and high glucocorticoid levels can transiently reduce CRF1 receptor expression ( Aguilera et al., 2004 ; Pozzoli et al., 1996 ), counteracting a possible ARB effect. In addition, ARBs inhibit HPA axis stimulation including CRF transcription after 24 hours of isolation stress ( Armando et al., 2001 ; Armando et al., 2007 ), and it is possible that these compounds might inhibit CRF transcription only under conditions of sustained, but not acute stress. We conclude that the influence of PVN AT1 receptors on LPS-induced acute CRF release is complex and not completely clarified. The pituitary gland as a target organ for systemically administered LPS The present in vivo results support the mRNA expression of both the LPS recognition molecule CD14 and the LPS receptor TLR4 in pituitary gland, previously reported in cultured pituitary cells ( Breuel et al., 2004 ; Iwasaki et al., 2008 ; Lohrer et al., 2000 ). LPS administration up-regulated CD14 mRNA expression in the pituitary gland, a finding that has been consistently reported for different tissues ( Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2009 ; Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2008 ; Singh and Jiang, 2004 ). On the other hand, while LPS did not affect expression of TLR4 in the pituitary gland or spleen ( Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2009 ), it decreased TLR4 mRNA expression in the adrenal gland ( Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2008 ) and it increased TLR4 in brain endothelial cells ( Singh and Jiang, 2004 ). Thus, it appears that the endotoxin strongly affects transcription of its recognition molecules and receptors, but that the effects are selective and tissue-dependent. LPS selectively up-regulates AT<sub>1A</sub> receptors in the anterior pituitary Pituitary AT1A receptor transcription is selectively upregulated in both acute and repeated restraint stress ( Leong et al., 2002 ), in the stress-prone Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats ( Johren et al., 2003 ), and, as reported here, during acute inflammatory stress. Conversely, inflammation does not change pituitary AT1B receptor transcription. These observations indicate that upregulation of AT1A receptor mRNA, a common feature of different stress models, participates in the pituitary response to LPS. The lack of changes in AT1 receptor binding after LPS administration in these studies is probably due to the short time after a single dose of LPS. In addition, the upregulated AT1A receptor mRNA transcribes a small portion of the total AT1 receptors in the pituitary ( Kakar et al., 1992 ; Lenkei et al., 1999 ; Leong et al., 2002 ). Our results provide no information on the cellular localization of the upregulated AT1A receptor mRNA. While AT1B receptors are localized mainly in lactotropes and corticotropes, the precise localization of AT1A receptors is still uncertain ( Kakar et al., 1992 ; Lenkei et al., 1999 ; Leong et al., 2002 ). AT1 receptors in the anterior pituitary may respond not only to locally formed but to circulating Ang II. However, the dose of LPS administered here does not stimulate the circulating RAS ( Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2008 ); and LPS does not alter pituitary renin, ACE or angiotensinogen mRNA. Thus, we do not have evidence of participation of higher levels of circulating or locally formed Ang II during LPS challenge. Effects of LPS on pro-inflammatory factors in pituitary gland LPS increased activity of the early transcription factor NF-?B as revealed by up-regulation of I?B-? mRNA ( Ghosh and Karin, 2002 ; Nam, 2006 ), explaining the stimulation of multiple pro-inflammatory factors described here. Conversely, LPS did not affect c-fos gene expression, an effect earlier demonstrated in other organs ( Lu et al., 2008 ; Singru et al., 2008 ; Wei et al., 2008 ) or gene expression of MIF, a pituitary factor associated with enhancement of endotoxemia ( Bernhagen et al., 1993 ) and a counter-regulator of the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids ( Bucala, 1996 ). LPS exerted a selective influence on NOS isoenzymes. Both iNOS gene expression and activity were increased by LPS. On the other hand, LPS stimulated nNOS/eNOS activity while reducing nNOS and eNOS transcription, perhaps the consequence of a negative feedback. In spite of the increased COX-2 gene expression following LPS, PGE2 levels were not altered by the endothoxin at the time studied. These apparent paradoxes reveal the complexity of the LPS effects and the limitations of our approach, the determination of LPS effects with a single dose at a single time point after administration. Effects of AT<sub>1</sub> receptor blockade on LPS-induced effects in pituitary Candesartan significantly decreased the LPS-induced NF-?B activation and IL-6, LIF, iNOS and COX-2 gene expression, factors regulated by NF-?B ( Ghosh and Karin, 2002 ; Nam, 2006 ). Conversely, the ARB did not affect IL-1? and TNF-? gene expression, also regulated by NF-?B ( Ghosh and Karin, 2002 ; Nam, 2006 ). An attractive hypothesis to explain these complex interactions is that LPS and the ARB may predominantly target selective cells types such as the widely distributed folliculo-stellate cells (FS). Cultured FS cells express both LPS and Ang II receptors ( Lohrer et al., 2000 ; Sudo et al., 2001 ); respond to LPS increasing cytokine synthesis and release ( Lohrer et al., 2000 ; Tierney et al., 2005 ); and to Ang II increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration ( Sudo et al., 2001 ); and these cells contribute to the regulation of the neuroendocrine response to immune stress and inflammation in a paracrine fashion ( Allaerts and Vankelecom, 2005 ; Denef, 2008 ; Fauquier et al., 2001 ; Herkenham, 2005 ; Lohrer et al., 2000 ; Vankelecom et al., 1993 ). In the anterior pituitary, IL-6, LIF, iNOS, nNOS and I?B-? genes are highly or exclusively expressed in FS cells ( Allaerts and Vankelecom, 2005 ; Denef, 2008 ; Ray and Melmed, 1997 ; Vankelecom et al., 1993 ). Conversely, IL-1? and TNF-? may be produced in macrophage-like cells ( Eriksson et al., 2000 ; Herkenham, 2005 ; Nadeau and Rivest, 1999 ; Whiteside et al., 1999 ). Cell selectivity may also explain the ARB effect on NO formation. The ARB blockade of LPS-induced Ca2+-dependent eNOS/nNOS activity may be very well explained by the inhibition of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and capacitative Ca2+ entry, mechanisms that follow AT1 receptor activation in FS cells ( Suarez et al., 2002 ). Our results suggest that the overall effect of the ARB may be a net decrease of pro-inflammatory NO in FS cells followed by a paracrine reduction of COX-2 activation in closely associated cells ( Nogawa et al., 1998 ). However, whether AT1A receptors are predominantly located in FS cells is an open question. In addition to its modulation of LPS effects, the ARB decreased steady-state PGE2 production when administered alone. Since PGE2 mediates inflammation, this may contribute to the general anti-inflammatory activity of ARBs ( Marchesi et al., 2008 ) ARB effects on LPS-stimulated ACTH and corticosterone The release of ACTH from pituitary is influenced by several factors acting synchronically, including PVN activation, paracrine intra-pituitary interactions and circulating factors ( Denef, 2008 ; Ray and Melmed, 1997 ). We report that the ARB significantly decreases LPS-induced ACTH release from the pituitary, an effect that may be related to a decrease in CRF release, as suggested above. However, we found strong evidence for direct ARB effects in the pituitary; the ARB decreased LPS-induced LIF and IL-6 gene expression, factors which increase ACTH release and synergize with CRF ( Auernhammer and Melmed, 2000 ; Denef, 2008 ; Ray and Melmed, 1997 ). While limiting the ACTH response to LPS, the ARB, paradoxically, does not decrease corticosterone release from the adrenal gland. The mechanisms of LPS increase in corticosterone secretion are complex, including not only enhancement through ACTH but also direct stimulation through splanchnic innervation of the adrenal cortex ( Fleshner et al., 1998 ) and direct effects of the endotoxin on adrenocortical cells ( Vakharia and Hinson, 2005 ). Failure of ARBs to decrease corticosterone release ( Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2008 ) suggest that neither the splanchnic-mediated nor direct adrenal LPS effects are mediated through AT1 receptor activation. This indicates the possibility that LPS releases corticosterone through Ang II-dependent (ACTH-mediated) and independent (splanchnic stimulation, direct effects on adrenal cortex) pathways. Glucocorticoids have potent anti-inflammatory properties ( Elenkov and Chrousos, 2006 ; Fernandes et al., 2008 ) and preservation of glucocorticoid release may contribute to the general anti-inflammatory activity of ARBs ( Marchesi et al., 2008 ). In conclusion, our in vivo results demonstrate that the pituitary gland is a target organ for systemically administered LPS and reveal that AT1 receptor activity is necessary for a complete response to the endotoxin. AT1 receptor activity regulates some, but not all, the mechanisms underlying LPS effects in the pituitary, suggesting the existence of Ang II-dependent and independent regulatory mechanisms for specific pro-inflammatory factors in the gland. Our results may be best interpreted as a combination of a partial reduction on centrally-mediated HPA axis stimulation, direct effects in the pituitary gland and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine release to the circulation. The selective effects of ARBs on pituitary mediators may be a useful tool for understanding the complex central and local regulatory mechanisms of the endotoxin effect on this gland. Our results further establish the general anti-inflammatory effects of ARBs, and support the hypothesis that these compounds may have beneficial effects in inflammatory disorders.

We interpret our results as a consequence of the subseptic dose of LPS administered, inducing CRF release with no detectable effect on its synthesis ( Loum-Ribot et al., 2006 ), while septic doses of LPS are able to increase both CRF synthesis and release ( Grinevich et al., 2001 ; Loum-Ribot et al., 2006 ; Rivest and Laflamme, 1995 ). ARB treatment drastically decreased PVN AT1A receptor binding, verification of central receptor blockade following peripheral ARB administration ( Nishimura et al., 2000 ), and significantly reduced LPS-induced ACTH release from the pituitary gland, indirect evidence of blockade of CRF release. However, the ARB did not modify the selective downregulation of pituitary CRF1 receptors. The LPS increase in corticosterone release was not reduced by the ARB, and high glucocorticoid levels can transiently reduce CRF1 receptor expression ( Aguilera et al., 2004 ; Pozzoli et al., 1996 ), counteracting a possible ARB effect. In addition, ARBs inhibit HPA axis stimulation including CRF transcription after 24 hours of isolation stress ( Armando et al., 2001 ; Armando et al., 2007 ), and it is possible that these compounds might inhibit CRF transcription only under conditions of sustained, but not acute stress. We conclude that the influence of PVN AT1 receptors on LPS-induced acute CRF release is complex and not completely clarified.  Effects of LPS and ARB treatment on the hypothalamic PVN The central response to endothoxin is most probably a combination of stimulation of circumventricular organs, vagal afferents, perivascular macrophages and endothelial cells, leading to increased hypothalamic CRF synthesis and release ( Dantzer et al., 2008 ). We focused on the role of AT1A receptors in the PVN, upregulated in immobilization and isolation stress, and a powerful factor regulating CRF production and release ( Armando et al., 2007 ; Castren and Saavedra, 1988 , 1989 ; Jezova et al., 1998 ; Leong et al., 2002 ). Increased PVN AT1A receptor transcription following inflammatory stress strongly suggests that receptor upregulation is an important component of the HPA axis stimulation. The early phase of inflammatory HPA axis stimulation was not associated with increased AT1 receptor expression, in agreement with earlier results demonstrating that enhanced receptor expression requires prolonged or repeated stress ( Armando et al., 2007 ; Castren and Saavedra, 1988 ; Jezova et al., 1998 ; Leong et al., 2002 ). In association with increased AT1A receptor transcription, LPS induced pituitary CRF1 receptor downregulation, decreased pituitary ACTH content, and increased plasma ACTH and corticosterone, unequivocal indication of CRF release ( Aguilera et al., 2004 ; Pozzoli et al., 1996 ).

We conclude that the influence of PVN AT1 receptors on LPS-induced acute CRF release is complex and not completely clarified.  The pituitary gland as a target organ for systemically administered LPS The present in vivo results support the mRNA expression of both the LPS recognition molecule CD14 and the LPS receptor TLR4 in pituitary gland, previously reported in cultured pituitary cells ( Breuel et al., 2004 ; Iwasaki et al., 2008 ; Lohrer et al., 2000 ). LPS administration up-regulated CD14 mRNA expression in the pituitary gland, a finding that has been consistently reported for different tissues ( Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2009 ; Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2008 ; Singh and Jiang, 2004 ). On the other hand, while LPS did not affect expression of TLR4 in the pituitary gland or spleen ( Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2009 ), it decreased TLR4 mRNA expression in the adrenal gland ( Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2008 ) and it increased TLR4 in brain endothelial cells ( Singh and Jiang, 2004 ). Thus, it appears that the endotoxin strongly affects transcription of its recognition molecules and receptors, but that the effects are selective and tissue-dependent.

Thus, it appears that the endotoxin strongly affects transcription of its recognition molecules and receptors, but that the effects are selective and tissue-dependent.  LPS selectively up-regulates AT<sub>1A</sub> receptors in the anterior pituitary Pituitary AT1A receptor transcription is selectively upregulated in both acute and repeated restraint stress ( Leong et al., 2002 ), in the stress-prone Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats ( Johren et al., 2003 ), and, as reported here, during acute inflammatory stress. Conversely, inflammation does not change pituitary AT1B receptor transcription. These observations indicate that upregulation of AT1A receptor mRNA, a common feature of different stress models, participates in the pituitary response to LPS. The lack of changes in AT1 receptor binding after LPS administration in these studies is probably due to the short time after a single dose of LPS. In addition, the upregulated AT1A receptor mRNA transcribes a small portion of the total AT1 receptors in the pituitary ( Kakar et al., 1992 ; Lenkei et al., 1999 ; Leong et al., 2002 ). Our results provide no information on the cellular localization of the upregulated AT1A receptor mRNA. While AT1B receptors are localized mainly in lactotropes and corticotropes, the precise localization of AT1A receptors is still uncertain ( Kakar et al., 1992 ; Lenkei et al., 1999 ; Leong et al., 2002 ). AT1 receptors in the anterior pituitary may respond not only to locally formed but to circulating Ang II. However, the dose of LPS administered here does not stimulate the circulating RAS ( Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2008 ); and LPS does not alter pituitary renin, ACE or angiotensinogen mRNA. Thus, we do not have evidence of participation of higher levels of circulating or locally formed Ang II during LPS challenge.

Thus, we do not have evidence of participation of higher levels of circulating or locally formed Ang II during LPS challenge.  Effects of LPS on pro-inflammatory factors in pituitary gland LPS increased activity of the early transcription factor NF-?B as revealed by up-regulation of I?B-? mRNA ( Ghosh and Karin, 2002 ; Nam, 2006 ), explaining the stimulation of multiple pro-inflammatory factors described here. Conversely, LPS did not affect c-fos gene expression, an effect earlier demonstrated in other organs ( Lu et al., 2008 ; Singru et al., 2008 ; Wei et al., 2008 ) or gene expression of MIF, a pituitary factor associated with enhancement of endotoxemia ( Bernhagen et al., 1993 ) and a counter-regulator of the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids ( Bucala, 1996 ). LPS exerted a selective influence on NOS isoenzymes. Both iNOS gene expression and activity were increased by LPS. On the other hand, LPS stimulated nNOS/eNOS activity while reducing nNOS and eNOS transcription, perhaps the consequence of a negative feedback. In spite of the increased COX-2 gene expression following LPS, PGE2 levels were not altered by the endothoxin at the time studied. These apparent paradoxes reveal the complexity of the LPS effects and the limitations of our approach, the determination of LPS effects with a single dose at a single time point after administration.  Effects of LPS on pro-inflammatory factors in pituitary gland LPS increased activity of the early transcription factor NF-?B as revealed by up-regulation of I?B-? mRNA ( Ghosh and Karin, 2002 ; Nam, 2006 ), explaining the stimulation of multiple pro-inflammatory factors described here.

These apparent paradoxes reveal the complexity of the LPS effects and the limitations of our approach, the determination of LPS effects with a single dose at a single time point after administration.  Effects of AT<sub>1</sub> receptor blockade on LPS-induced effects in pituitary Candesartan significantly decreased the LPS-induced NF-?B activation and IL-6, LIF, iNOS and COX-2 gene expression, factors regulated by NF-?B ( Ghosh and Karin, 2002 ; Nam, 2006 ). Conversely, the ARB did not affect IL-1? and TNF-? gene expression, also regulated by NF-?B ( Ghosh and Karin, 2002 ; Nam, 2006 ). An attractive hypothesis to explain these complex interactions is that LPS and the ARB may predominantly target selective cells types such as the widely distributed folliculo-stellate cells (FS). Cultured FS cells express both LPS and Ang II receptors ( Lohrer et al., 2000 ; Sudo et al., 2001 ); respond to LPS increasing cytokine synthesis and release ( Lohrer et al., 2000 ; Tierney et al., 2005 ); and to Ang II increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration ( Sudo et al., 2001 ); and these cells contribute to the regulation of the neuroendocrine response to immune stress and inflammation in a paracrine fashion ( Allaerts and Vankelecom, 2005 ; Denef, 2008 ; Fauquier et al., 2001 ; Herkenham, 2005 ; Lohrer et al., 2000 ; Vankelecom et al., 1993 ). In the anterior pituitary, IL-6, LIF, iNOS, nNOS and I?B-? genes are highly or exclusively expressed in FS cells ( Allaerts and Vankelecom, 2005 ; Denef, 2008 ; Ray and Melmed, 1997 ; Vankelecom et al., 1993 ). Conversely, IL-1? and TNF-? may be produced in macrophage-like cells ( Eriksson et al., 2000 ; Herkenham, 2005 ; Nadeau and Rivest, 1999 ; Whiteside et al., 1999 ). Cell selectivity may also explain the ARB effect on NO formation. The ARB blockade of LPS-induced Ca2+-dependent eNOS/nNOS activity may be very well explained by the inhibition of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and capacitative Ca2+ entry, mechanisms that follow AT1 receptor activation in FS cells ( Suarez et al., 2002 ). Our results suggest that the overall effect of the ARB may be a net decrease of pro-inflammatory NO in FS cells followed by a paracrine reduction of COX-2 activation in closely associated cells ( Nogawa et al., 1998 ). However, whether AT1A receptors are predominantly located in FS cells is an open question. In addition to its modulation of LPS effects, the ARB decreased steady-state PGE2 production when administered alone. Since PGE2 mediates inflammation, this may contribute to the general anti-inflammatory activity of ARBs ( Marchesi et al., 2008 )  Effects of AT<sub>1</sub> receptor blockade on LPS-induced effects in pituitary Candesartan significantly decreased the LPS-induced NF-?B activation and IL-6, LIF, iNOS and COX-2 gene expression, factors regulated by NF-?B ( Ghosh and Karin, 2002 ; Nam, 2006 ).

However, whether AT1A receptors are predominantly located in FS cells is an open question. In addition to its modulation of LPS effects, the ARB decreased steady-state PGE2 production when administered alone. Since PGE2 mediates inflammation, this may contribute to the general anti-inflammatory activity of ARBs ( Marchesi et al., 2008 )  ARB effects on LPS-stimulated ACTH and corticosterone The release of ACTH from pituitary is influenced by several factors acting synchronically, including PVN activation, paracrine intra-pituitary interactions and circulating factors ( Denef, 2008 ; Ray and Melmed, 1997 ). We report that the ARB significantly decreases LPS-induced ACTH release from the pituitary, an effect that may be related to a decrease in CRF release, as suggested above. However, we found strong evidence for direct ARB effects in the pituitary; the ARB decreased LPS-induced LIF and IL-6 gene expression, factors which increase ACTH release and synergize with CRF ( Auernhammer and Melmed, 2000 ; Denef, 2008 ; Ray and Melmed, 1997 ). While limiting the ACTH response to LPS, the ARB, paradoxically, does not decrease corticosterone release from the adrenal gland. The mechanisms of LPS increase in corticosterone secretion are complex, including not only enhancement through ACTH but also direct stimulation through splanchnic innervation of the adrenal cortex ( Fleshner et al., 1998 ) and direct effects of the endotoxin on adrenocortical cells ( Vakharia and Hinson, 2005 ). Failure of ARBs to decrease corticosterone release ( Sanchez-Lemus et al., 2008 ) suggest that neither the splanchnic-mediated nor direct adrenal LPS effects are mediated through AT1 receptor activation. This indicates the possibility that LPS releases corticosterone through Ang II-dependent (ACTH-mediated) and independent (splanchnic stimulation, direct effects on adrenal cortex) pathways. Glucocorticoids have potent anti-inflammatory properties ( Elenkov and Chrousos, 2006 ; Fernandes et al., 2008 ) and preservation of glucocorticoid release may contribute to the general anti-inflammatory activity of ARBs ( Marchesi et al., 2008 ). In conclusion, our in vivo results demonstrate that the pituitary gland is a target organ for systemically administered LPS and reveal that AT1 receptor activity is necessary for a complete response to the endotoxin. AT1 receptor activity regulates some, but not all, the mechanisms underlying LPS effects in the pituitary, suggesting the existence of Ang II-dependent and independent regulatory mechanisms for specific pro-inflammatory factors in the gland. Our results may be best interpreted as a combination of a partial reduction on centrally-mediated HPA axis stimulation, direct effects in the pituitary gland and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine release to the circulation. The selective effects of ARBs on pituitary mediators may be a useful tool for understanding the complex central and local regulatory mechanisms of the endotoxin effect on this gland. Our results further establish the general anti-inflammatory effects of ARBs, and support the hypothesis that these compounds may have beneficial effects in inflammatory disorders.
