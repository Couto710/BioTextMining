Does Fgf23-klotho activity influence vascular and soft tissue calcification through regulating phosphate homeostasis? Recent studies describe a novel role of fibroblast growth factor 23 (Fgf23)-klotho activity in the systemic regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Both Fgf23 and klotho ablated mice develop extensive vascular and soft tissue calcification. Inability to clear the required amount of phosphate by the kidney, due to the absence of Fgf23-klotho activity, leads to increased serum accumulation of phosphate in these genetically modified mice, causing extensive calcification. Serum calcium levels are also elevated in both Fgf23 and klotho ablated mice. Moreover, increased sodium-phosphate co-transporter activity in both Fgf23 and klotho ablated mice increases renal phosphate reabsorption which in turn can facilitate calcification. Collectively, these observations bring new insights into our understanding of the roles of the Fgf23-klotho axis in the development of vascular and soft tissue calcification.
