Deviant P300 Amplitude Development in Males Is Associated With Paternal Externalizing Psychopathology Boys at risk for alcoholism show deviant P300 amplitude development. Genetic influences on P300, however, are related to a range of externalizing disorders. This study examined whether P300 development from adolescence to early adulthood differed between groups varying in severity of paternal externalizing. Parietal P300 was assessed during the “rotated heads” task on up to 3 times between the ages of 17 and 24 years. Participants were divided into 3 paternal externalizing groups: (a) severe (father has adult antisocial behavior), (b) intermediate (father has alcohol dependence but not a more severe disorder), and (c) low (father has no externalizing disorders or substance treatment and is not extreme in alcohol use). Mixed models were used to evaluate linear change in amplitude. P300 decreased with age. The severe-risk group had smaller P300 initially and changed less with time than did the low-risk group. The intermediate-risk group did not differ significantly from the low-risk group, but differed marginally from the severe-risk males. Externalizing and early-onset substance disorders in the sons were associated with smaller initial values of P300. Measures of deviant P300 development may be vulnerability markers for externalizing psychopathology.  Method Participants Participants were drawn from the 578 young men who were in the 17-year-old age cohort of the Minnesota Twin Family Study (MTFS; Iacono, Carlson, Taylor, Elkins, & McGue, 1999 ). The total number of participants per paternal risk group was 161 men in the low-risk group (from 87 fathers), 126 men in the intermediate-risk group (from 70 fathers), and 82 men in the severe-risk group (from 44 fathers). Participants were identified from birth records of the Minnesota Department of Health as being twins born in the state of Minnesota during the years 1972–1978. They were invited to come to the laboratories of the MTFS by phone or by mail during their senior year of high school. Details regarding the sampling approach and representativeness of the sample recruited were provided in Iacono et al. (1999) and Holdcraft and Iacono (2004) . Table 1 depicts demographic data for the participants in the externalizing risk groups. In general, the data in Table 1 indicate that compared with the low-risk fathers, both the intermediate- and severe-risk fathers were less well educated and had lower levels of occupational status. Ethnicity did not differ significantly across risk groups. Regarding offspring diagnoses, prevalence rates were substantially higher in the severe- versus the low-risk group. As expected, those in the intermediate-risk group generally tended to fall between these other two groups. Offspring IQ did not differentiate the groups. Data were available for the first visit and two subsequent follow-ups at roughly 3-year intervals. Informed consent was obtained from all adult participants. Informed assent and parental consent were obtained when participants were under 18 years. All procedures were approved by the appropriate institutional ethics review board. Rotated Heads Task At each assessment, participants performed the “rotated heads” task of Begleiter et al. (1984) . A series of stimuli representing the superior view of a schematic head were presented on a computer monitor positioned approximately 48 cm from the participant. Figure 1 illustrates the stimuli used in this task. On 80 of the trials, stimuli were presented with a cartoon nose and a single ear. Participants were instructed to press one of two buttons corresponding to the side of the head the ear was on as quickly but as accurately as they could. On half of these target trials, the nose was pointed toward the top of the screen. In these trials, an ear on the right side of the screen was on the right side of the head and an ear on the left side of the screen was on the left side of the head. This was designated the easy condition. On the remaining target trials, the nose pointed to the bottom of the screen. In this hard condition, an ear on the right side of the screen corresponded to the left side of the head and vice versa. Correct responses on these trials entailed pressing a button with the hand opposite to the side of the screen the ear appeared on. There were an equal number of left and right ears in both the easy and the hard conditions. These target stimuli were presented pseudorandomly within a series of 160 neutral stimuli consisting of a simple oval. Participants were instructed not to respond to these nontargets. Stimuli appeared with a duration of 98 ms and an intertrial interval that varied randomly between 1 s and 2 s. Psychophysiological Assessment Electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrooculographic (EOG) data were filtered and amplified with a Grass Model 12c Neurodata Acquisition System (Grass Instruments, Quincy, MA). Signals were collected through AC amplifiers with 1/2 amplitude low-and high-frequency filter settings at .01 and 30 Hz (18 dB/octave roll-off), respectively. EEG signals were recorded from the Pz, P3, and P4 scalp sites using an electrode cap with a linked ears reference. A ground electrode was affixed to the right shin, and EOG sensors were placed above and to the temporal side of an eye. Electrode site impedance was kept below 5 k? for the scalp sites and the ears and below 10 k? for the ground and EOG sites. Data were sampled during a 2,000-ms epoch with a 500-ms prestimulus baseline at a rate of 256 Hz. If a participant failed to respond within the epoch or if the A–D converter became saturated, the trial was rejected and repeated after the presentation of two additional neutral stimuli. This was done to preserve the global probability of target versus neutral stimuli while ensuring that participants had the same number of trials contributing to the event-related potentials. EEG signals were subjected offline to a 7.5-Hz low-pass digital filter to attenuate high-frequency noise and to the blink-correction algorithm of Gratton, Coles, and Donchin (1983) . As in past studies from the MTFS that used this task (e.g., Carlson & Iacono, 2006 ; Carlson, Iacono, & McGue, 2002 , Carlson, Iacono, & McGue, 2004 ; Carlson, Katsanis, Iacono, & Mertz, 1999 ; Carlson et al., 2007 ; Hicks et al., 2007 ; Iacono, Carlson, Malone, & McGue, 2002 ; Katsanis, Iacono, McGue, & Carlson, 1997 ; Patrick et al., 2006 ), a rater unaware of participant diagnosis or family history used an interactive computer algorithm to identify P300 at the Pz site. The algorithm identified the maximum voltage in a window from 200 to 800 ms after stimulus onset. This liberal latency range was chosen so as not to artificially constrain P300 latency. The minimum and maximum observed latencies in this study were 300.78 and 617.19 ms, respectively. In cases in which there was more than one peak, the rater chose the second peak. The peak selected was also checked against the waveforms from P3 and P4 and corrected if needed. Amplitude was the difference in voltage between the mean of the 500-ms baseline and the selected peak. Psychiatric Assessment At the initial assessment, participants and their biological fathers underwent structured clinical interviews. Responses were subsequently reviewed in case conferences of at least two graduate students with advanced training in psychiatric diagnosis. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (3rd ed., revised, or DSM–III–R ; American Psychiatric Association, 1987 ) criteria were used because this was the nosology at study inception. Table 2 summarizes the semistructured clinical interviews used to assess disorders. Fathers were interviewed about pre–age 15 symptoms of conduct disorder (CD), post–age 15 symptoms of antisocial personality disorder (i.e., the adult antisocial behavior or AAB syndrome), and nicotine, alcohol, and drug use disorders. Fathers were also asked about their age at first drink without parental permission and the maximum number of alcoholic drinks consumed in a 24-hr period. A drink was defined as being equivalent to a glass of wine, a bottle or can of beer, a shot glass of liquor, or a mixed drink. At the initial assessment, adolescents were interviewed about their symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), CD, AAB, and substance disorders. At Time 1 only, their mothers also reported on their symptoms of ADHD, ODD, CD, and substance disorders. A symptom was considered present if either informant reported it present and absent if they agreed on its absence. At the two follow-up assessments, the young men were interviewed about lifetime substance use disorders, CD, and AAB. At the second follow-up, they reported on substance disorders since the previous assessment and lifetime CD and AAB. The fathers’ interviewers were unaware of offspring diagnoses and vice versa. Kappa coefficients for the diagnoses used in this study ranged from 0.71 for ODD to 0.91 for substance use disorders ( Iacono et al., 1999 ), suggesting good to excellent reliability. Consistent with past P300 studies from the MTFS ( Carlson et al., 2002 , 2004 ; Carlson et al., 1999 , 2007 ; Iacono, Carlson, & Malone, 2000 ; Iacono et al., 2002 , 1999 ), a disorder was considered present if it was at the definite (i.e., minimum DSM–III–R criteria are met) or probable (i.e., all but one DSM–III–R criterion is met) level of diagnostic certainty and absent otherwise. Collapsing across the definite and probable levels of certainty, an approach for diagnosing lifetime psychopathology that was introduced with the Research Diagnostic Criteria ( Spitzer, Endicott, & Robins, 1978 ), is important for assessing disorders in individuals who are not currently symptomatic and who may have difficulty recalling symptoms experienced years or decades earlier. Earlier onset substance disorder was defined as in Carlson et al. (2007) as the presence of alcohol abuse or dependence, illicit drug abuse or dependence, or nicotine dependence with onset by the first follow-up (e.g., onset by approximately age 20). Externalizing Risk Group Definitions An externalizing low-risk group consisted of those young men whose fathers had no history of CD, AAB, alcohol abuse or dependence, illicit drug abuse or dependence, or alcohol or drug treatment. Earlier age at first alcohol use has been associated with higher rates of externalizing characteristics such as antisocial behavior, illicit substance use and abuse, and disinhibited personality characteristics ( Clark, 2004 ; McGue, Iacono, Legrand, Malone, & Elkins, 2001 ; Schuckit & Russell, 1983 ). The maximum number of drinks in a 24-hr period has been described as a promising quantitative endophenotype for alcoholism risk ( Malone, Iacono, & McGue, 2002 ). Both of these paternal alcohol use measures have been associated with reduced P300 amplitude in sons even in the absence of paternal substance disorder diagnoses ( Iacono et al., 2002 ). As in Iacono et al. (2002) , to reduce false negatives young men whose fathers were in the upper decile of the maximum consumption measure or in the lower decile of age at first drink were excluded from the low-risk group. A severe externalizing risk group consisted of young men whose fathers met criteria for the AAB syndrome. An intermediate externalizing risk group consisted of young men whose fathers had alcohol dependence, but not drug dependence or AAB. Young men were said to have an externalizing disorder if they had lifetime ADHD, ODD, CD, AAB, or earlier onset alcohol abuse or dependence, drug abuse or dependence, or nicotine dependence. The inclusion of nicotine dependence reflected its emergence as a strongly heritable indicator of externalizing in MTFS youths ( McGue, Iacono, & Krueger, 2006 ), coupled with the fact that when included as part of the externalizing composite, the composite was genetically related to P300 amplitude ( Hicks et al., 2007 ). The inclusion of substance abuse in this definition was intended to reduce the number of false negatives in the disorder-free group. Diagnostic status was unknown for a small number of participants because they were disorder free at earlier assessments and did not participate at later occasions. Excluded were 36.2% of the 578 young men in this sample who had fathers who did not meet criteria for one of our externalizing groups and whose externalizing status would thus have been ambiguous. P300 was missing on some occasions because participants did not participate, because of computer or equipment problems, or because of poor task performance (i.e., >5 errors). Across the three paternal risk groups there were 1,107 potential P300 measurements (i.e., 3 assessments × [161 + 126 + 82 participants]). Of these, 30.4% were missing for one of the aforementioned reasons. The number of participants in each paternal risk group with usable P300 amplitude at each time point is presented in Table 3 . Growth Model Analysis Provisional visual inspection of individual growth plots of P300 amplitude by age suggested a linear model of change for this age range ( Carlson & Iacono, 2006 ). SAS PROC MIXED ( SAS Institute, 1998 ) with full maximum likelihood estimation, unstructured residual variance matrices, and the “between– within” method for determining degrees of freedom was used to fit mixed models as suggested by Singer and Willet (2003) . SAS PROC MIXED assumes that data are missing at random. The models fit to P300 amplitude were “three-level” linear mixed models appropriate for use with multiple participants from the same family ( Khoo & Muthén, 2000 ). As such, random effects were allowed for intercept, slope, and their covariance at the level of both the individual participant and the family. The measure of age at each time point was the participant’s age ( X ) minus the mean age at the initial assessment (17.49 years). Centering at the mean age makes our P300 intercept interpretable as the mean amplitude at this wave of assessment. This makes our intercept directly comparable to that of our past published studies reporting on P300 amplitude at this wave ( Carlson et al., 2002 , 2004 ; Carlson et al., 1999 ; Carlson et al., 2007 ; Iacono et al., 2000 ; Iacono et al., 2002 ; Iacono et al., 1999 ), as well as being consistent with our behavior genetic growth model using these participants ( Carlson & Iacono, 2006 ). Although individuals were targeted for assessment at ages 17, 20, and 23, to optimize participation we allowed some flexibility in scheduling around the targeted age, especially as participants became older and more independent. A continuous measure of age rather than a dummy variable coded for assessment wave was used because of the nontrivial variability in age at some assessment points (particularly at Time 3). This also allowed for more precise estimates of growth parameters by using the relatively greater amount of information contained in a continuous measure. Paternal risk group and offspring externalizing disorder were treated as categorical variables. The genetically mediated covariance between intercept and slope previously reported ( Carlson & Iacono, 2006 ) makes separate interpretations of intercept and slope differences problematic. As such, we have adopted the approach of Hill et al. (1999) and used Wald tests of joint hypotheses regarding intercept and slope to test differences between groups in P300 amplitude trajectories. Such an approach tests the joint null hypotheses that groups do not differ in intercept and slope. Follow-up tests to determine age ranges in which groups differed significantly in P300 amplitude were conducted using the approach of D. J. Bauer and Curran (2005 ; see also Preacher, Curran, & Bauer, 2006 ). This approach identifies what the difference in intercept between two risk groups would be at each age and a 95% confidence interval for this value. 1 We further used the approach of D. J. Bauer and Curran (2005) to identify the precise ages that bracket the range in which these group differences are statistically significant.  Participants Participants were drawn from the 578 young men who were in the 17-year-old age cohort of the Minnesota Twin Family Study (MTFS; Iacono, Carlson, Taylor, Elkins, & McGue, 1999 ). The total number of participants per paternal risk group was 161 men in the low-risk group (from 87 fathers), 126 men in the intermediate-risk group (from 70 fathers), and 82 men in the severe-risk group (from 44 fathers).

Consistent with past P300 studies from the MTFS ( Carlson et al., 2002 , 2004 ; Carlson et al., 1999 , 2007 ; Iacono, Carlson, & Malone, 2000 ; Iacono et al., 2002 , 1999 ), a disorder was considered present if it was at the definite (i.e., minimum DSM–III–R criteria are met) or probable (i.e., all but one DSM–III–R criterion is met) level of diagnostic certainty and absent otherwise.

Earlier onset substance disorder was defined as in Carlson et al. (2007) as the presence of alcohol abuse or dependence, illicit drug abuse or dependence, or nicotine dependence with onset by the first follow-up (e.g., onset by approximately age 20).  Externalizing Risk Group Definitions An externalizing low-risk group consisted of those young men whose fathers had no history of CD, AAB, alcohol abuse or dependence, illicit drug abuse or dependence, or alcohol or drug treatment. Earlier age at first alcohol use has been associated with higher rates of externalizing characteristics such as antisocial behavior, illicit substance use and abuse, and disinhibited personality characteristics ( Clark, 2004 ; McGue, Iacono, Legrand, Malone, & Elkins, 2001 ; Schuckit & Russell, 1983 ). The maximum number of drinks in a 24-hr period has been described as a promising quantitative endophenotype for alcoholism risk ( Malone, Iacono, & McGue, 2002 ). Both of these paternal alcohol use measures have been associated with reduced P300 amplitude in sons even in the absence of paternal substance disorder diagnoses ( Iacono et al., 2002 ). As in Iacono et al. (2002) , to reduce false negatives young men whose fathers were in the upper decile of the maximum consumption measure or in the lower decile of age at first drink were excluded from the low-risk group. A severe externalizing risk group consisted of young men whose fathers met criteria for the AAB syndrome. An intermediate externalizing risk group consisted of young men whose fathers had alcohol dependence, but not drug dependence or AAB. Young men were said to have an externalizing disorder if they had lifetime ADHD, ODD, CD, AAB, or earlier onset alcohol abuse or dependence, drug abuse or dependence, or nicotine dependence. The inclusion of nicotine dependence reflected its emergence as a strongly heritable indicator of externalizing in MTFS youths ( McGue, Iacono, & Krueger, 2006 ), coupled with the fact that when included as part of the externalizing composite, the composite was genetically related to P300 amplitude ( Hicks et al., 2007 ). The inclusion of substance abuse in this definition was intended to reduce the number of false negatives in the disorder-free group. Diagnostic status was unknown for a small number of participants because they were disorder free at earlier assessments and did not participate at later occasions. Excluded were 36.2% of the 578 young men in this sample who had fathers who did not meet criteria for one of our externalizing groups and whose externalizing status would thus have been ambiguous. P300 was missing on some occasions because participants did not participate, because of computer or equipment problems, or because of poor task performance (i.e., >5 errors). Across the three paternal risk groups there were 1,107 potential P300 measurements (i.e., 3 assessments × [161 + 126 + 82 participants]). Of these, 30.4% were missing for one of the aforementioned reasons. The number of participants in each paternal risk group with usable P300 amplitude at each time point is presented in Table 3 .  Growth Model Analysis Provisional visual inspection of individual growth plots of P300 amplitude by age suggested a linear model of change for this age range ( Carlson & Iacono, 2006 ). SAS PROC MIXED ( SAS Institute, 1998 ) with full maximum likelihood estimation, unstructured residual variance matrices, and the “between– within” method for determining degrees of freedom was used to fit mixed models as suggested by Singer and Willet (2003) . SAS PROC MIXED assumes that data are missing at random. The models fit to P300 amplitude were “three-level” linear mixed models appropriate for use with multiple participants from the same family ( Khoo & Muthén, 2000 ). As such, random effects were allowed for intercept, slope, and their covariance at the level of both the individual participant and the family. The measure of age at each time point was the participant’s age ( X ) minus the mean age at the initial assessment (17.49 years). Centering at the mean age makes our P300 intercept interpretable as the mean amplitude at this wave of assessment. This makes our intercept directly comparable to that of our past published studies reporting on P300 amplitude at this wave ( Carlson et al., 2002 , 2004 ; Carlson et al., 1999 ; Carlson et al., 2007 ; Iacono et al., 2000 ; Iacono et al., 2002 ; Iacono et al., 1999 ), as well as being consistent with our behavior genetic growth model using these participants ( Carlson & Iacono, 2006 ). Although individuals were targeted for assessment at ages 17, 20, and 23, to optimize participation we allowed some flexibility in scheduling around the targeted age, especially as participants became older and more independent. A continuous measure of age rather than a dummy variable coded for assessment wave was used because of the nontrivial variability in age at some assessment points (particularly at Time 3). This also allowed for more precise estimates of growth parameters by using the relatively greater amount of information contained in a continuous measure. Paternal risk group and offspring externalizing disorder were treated as categorical variables. The genetically mediated covariance between intercept and slope previously reported ( Carlson & Iacono, 2006 ) makes separate interpretations of intercept and slope differences problematic. As such, we have adopted the approach of Hill et al. (1999) and used Wald tests of joint hypotheses regarding intercept and slope to test differences between groups in P300 amplitude trajectories. Such an approach tests the joint null hypotheses that groups do not differ in intercept and slope. Follow-up tests to determine age ranges in which groups differed significantly in P300 amplitude were conducted using the approach of D. J. Bauer and Curran (2005 ; see also Preacher, Curran, & Bauer, 2006 ). This approach identifies what the difference in intercept between two risk groups would be at each age and a 95% confidence interval for this value. 1 We further used the approach of D. J. Bauer and Curran (2005) to identify the precise ages that bracket the range in which these group differences are statistically significant.  Results Attrition We examined several patterns of missing data to see whether paternal risk groups differed in rates of attrition. About a quarter of all families (24.8%) in these three groups had complete P300 data at all assessments for both sons. This rate did not differ significantly across paternal risk groups (27.6% of low paternal risk, 30.0% of intermediate paternal risk, and 18.2% of severe paternal risk groups), ?2(2, N = 201) = 2.06, p = .357. Furthermore, 42.6% of families had P300 data at all three assessments from one offspring and no more than one missing P300 measure from the other (48.3 % of low paternal risk, 44.3% of intermediate paternal risk, and 36.4 % of paternal AAB groups). The paternal risk groups did not differ significantly in this pattern, ?2(2, N = 201) =1.68, p = .432. Finally, the majority (61.2%) of families had at least two P300 measures from both offspring (66.7% of low paternal risk, 57.1 % of intermediate paternal risk, and 52.3 % of paternal AAB groups, a nonsignificant difference), ?2(2, N = 201) = 2.95, p = .229). In addition to all of these analyses of the effects of missing data being nonsignificant, they all resulted in effect sizes that are conventionally regarded as being in the small effect range ( J. Cohen, 1988 ; .039 ? Cohen’s w ?.121). Given these patterns of missing data and the small effect sizes represented, it appears that there were no important systematic biases in attrition related to paternal history. This is consistent with the data missing at random. Paternal Externalizing and P300 Amplitude Change Grand mean event-related potential waveforms for each paternal risk group at each assessment are presented in Figure 2 . Table 3 presents descriptive statistics for the observed values of P300 amplitude and age at each measurement for those differing in diagnostic status and paternal risk. In the growth model, P300 decreased significantly with age, F (1, 573) = 96.36, p <.001. There was a significant difference across paternal risk groups in the mean intercept, F (2, 187) = 3.77, p = .025, and slope, F (2, 573) = 3.59, p = .028, of the developmental trajectories. The P300 amplitude trajectories predicted by the model are presented in Figure 3 . The paternal AAB group had a significantly different P300 amplitude trajectory from the low paternal risk group, ?2(1, N = 243) = 6.61, p = .010. 2 The young men whose fathers had AAB had a trajectory characterized by a smaller intercept ( M = 21.66 µV, SE = 1.07) and slope ( M = ?0.47 µV/year, SE = 0.13) than the low paternal risk group (mean intercept = 25.26 µV; SE = 1.31; mean slope = ?0.86 µV/year, SE = 0.16). Figure 4a illustrates what the difference in intercept between the paternal AAB and low paternal risk groups would be at different ages in the range observed if age had been centered at that point. Age is incremented by 0.25-year intervals, and 95% confidence intervals are provided for each estimate. This approach ( D. J. Bauer & Curran, 2005 ) for probing interactions in mixed models identifies the age at which these two groups would no longer differ significantly in P300 amplitude. The projected age range at which the paternal AAB and low-risk groups would no longer significantly differ was 20.87 years (in Figure 4a , the confidence intervals overlap 0 at this age). These two groups differed significantly at all earlier ages. There was a marginal difference between the developmental trajectories of the intermediate paternal risk group and the paternal AAB risk group, ?2(1, N = 208) =3.66, p = .056. The trajectory for the intermediate paternal risk group was characterized by a higher intercept ( M = 24.26 µV, SE = 1.38) and slope ( M = ?0.57 µV/year, SE = 0.17) than that of the paternal AAB risk group. Figure 4b illustrates the differences in intercept between these groups in the range observed. These differences were statistically significant between the ages of 17.63 and 20.15 years. The low- and intermediate-risk groups did not have significantly different trajectories, ?2(1, N = 287) = 0.41, p = .521. 3 Offspring Externalizing and P300 Amplitude Change A conditional growth model with sons’ externalizing status added as a predictor of intercept and slope was fit. 4 As before, P300 decreased significantly with age, F (1, 571) = 86.08, p < .001. Once the externalizing disorder status of the sons was added to the model, there was only a trend for the trajectories of the paternal AAB group to differ from the paternal low-risk group, ?2(1, N = 243) = 3.31, p = .069. The developmental trajectories of young men who developed an externalizing or early-onset substance disorder differed significantly from those who did not, ?2(1, N = 369) = 12.20, p < .001. The trajectory for the men with a disorder had a smaller intercept ( M = 21.39 µV, SE = 1.03) than that of the men who did not develop a disorder ( M = 24.33 µV, SE = 0.90), F (1, 41) = 10.94, p = .002, although the difference in slope between the groups was relatively small (mean difference = ?.063, SE = .135), F (1, 571) = 0.22, p = .640. P300 Amplitude Differences on Neutral Trials The young men with a paternal history of AAB had lower intercepts and less change over time than the low-risk participants. It is possible that the reduced slope characterizing this trajectory may be an artifact of the participants at highest risk having P300 amplitude at the start of the study close to an absolute psycho-physiological lower limit. The reduced change over time may reflect a floor effect consistent with Wilder’s (1967) law of initial values. One way to examine this possibility is to assume that the amplitude of the response to the neutral nontarget stimuli represents this lower limit and to then determine to what degree the target amplitude approximates this value at the time of the earliest assessment. A mixed model with task condition (neutral or target) as a fixed factor, amplitude measures nested within participants, and participants nested within families was fit to the Time 1 P300 amplitude of the paternal AAB group using PROC MIXED. This analysis was restricted to only the 40 men with data from the first and last assessments. In this group target, amplitude ( M = 22.72 µV, SE = 1.17) was significantly greater than neutral P300 amplitude ( M = 11.94 µV, SE = 1.03) at Time 1, F (1, 24) = 109.58, p <.001. This 10.78 µV ( SE = 1.03) difference was substantially greater than the observed decline of 3.72 µV ( SE = 0.90) in target P300 amplitude from Time 1 to Time 3 in this group, suggesting that their reduced slope for target amplitude cannot be readily attributed to a floor effect.  Results Attrition We examined several patterns of missing data to see whether paternal risk groups differed in rates of attrition. About a quarter of all families (24.8%) in these three groups had complete P300 data at all assessments for both sons. This rate did not differ significantly across paternal risk groups (27.6% of low paternal risk, 30.0% of intermediate paternal risk, and 18.2% of severe paternal risk groups), ?2(2, N = 201) = 2.06, p = .357. Furthermore, 42.6% of families had P300 data at all three assessments from one offspring and no more than one missing P300 measure from the other (48.3 % of low paternal risk, 44.3% of intermediate paternal risk, and 36.4 % of paternal AAB groups). The paternal risk groups did not differ significantly in this pattern, ?2(2, N = 201) =1.68, p = .432. Finally, the majority (61.2%) of families had at least two P300 measures from both offspring (66.7% of low paternal risk, 57.1 % of intermediate paternal risk, and 52.3 % of paternal AAB groups, a nonsignificant difference), ?2(2, N = 201) = 2.95, p = .229). In addition to all of these analyses of the effects of missing data being nonsignificant, they all resulted in effect sizes that are conventionally regarded as being in the small effect range ( J. Cohen, 1988 ; .039 ? Cohen’s w ?.121). Given these patterns of missing data and the small effect sizes represented, it appears that there were no important systematic biases in attrition related to paternal history. This is consistent with the data missing at random. Paternal Externalizing and P300 Amplitude Change Grand mean event-related potential waveforms for each paternal risk group at each assessment are presented in Figure 2 . Table 3 presents descriptive statistics for the observed values of P300 amplitude and age at each measurement for those differing in diagnostic status and paternal risk. In the growth model, P300 decreased significantly with age, F (1, 573) = 96.36, p <.001. There was a significant difference across paternal risk groups in the mean intercept, F (2, 187) = 3.77, p = .025, and slope, F (2, 573) = 3.59, p = .028, of the developmental trajectories. The P300 amplitude trajectories predicted by the model are presented in Figure 3 .

P300 Amplitude Differences on Neutral Trials The young men with a paternal history of AAB had lower intercepts and less change over time than the low-risk participants. It is possible that the reduced slope characterizing this trajectory may be an artifact of the participants at highest risk having P300 amplitude at the start of the study close to an absolute psycho-physiological lower limit. The reduced change over time may reflect a floor effect consistent with Wilder’s (1967) law of initial values. One way to examine this possibility is to assume that the amplitude of the response to the neutral nontarget stimuli represents this lower limit and to then determine to what degree the target amplitude approximates this value at the time of the earliest assessment.

Discussion Consistent with past findings ( Hill et al., 1999 ), visual P300 amplitude decreased significantly with age from 17 to 24 years in young men from a community sample. This finding is consistent with the results of studies using the same task as used here ( Hill et al., 1999 ; Katsanis et al., 1996 ), as well as with a variety of other visual tasks ( Courchesne, 1978 ; Friedman et al., 1989 ; Johnson, 1989 ; Mullis, Holcomb, Diner, & Dykman, 1985 ; Taylor, 1993 ). As we had predicted, developmental trajectories differed significantly across groups of young men varying in paternal history of externalizing problems. On the basis of findings of Hill and colleagues ( Hill & Shen, 2002 ; Hill et al., 1999 ), we had predicted that sons with heightened risk would have developmental trajectories characterized by lower intercepts and less change with age relative to those at low risk. Consistent with P300 amplitude being associated with risk for an externalizing dimension underlying vulnerability for substance use disorders ( Hicks et al., 2007 ; Patrick et al., 2006 ) and findings that paternal AAB is a more severe indicator of externalizing than of alcohol dependence ( Krueger et al., 2005 ), our hypothesis would predict the greatest difference between the sons of fathers with AAB and a low-risk group. This was the case. Men with a paternal history of alcohol dependence but no AAB or drug dependence would be predicted as being intermediate between the low-risk group and the paternal AAB group. Although there was a trend for a difference in trajectory between this intermediate paternal externalizing risk group and the paternal AAB group, this was not statistically significant by conventional standards. This intermediate-risk group also did not differ significantly from the low-risk group. The ability to detect externalizing risk group differences may require a fairly large difference in the level of paternal externalizing severity. Those who had developed an externalizing or earlier onset substance disorder had significantly different trajectories from those who did not have such a disorder. To a large extent, diagnostic status of the offspring is confounded with risk in this sample. Almost 92% of the paternal AAB group and 76.4% of the intermediate-risk group had at least one earlier onset substance disorder or other externalizing disorder. There are several reasons why an interpretation of trajectory differences as reflecting a vulnerability contributing to these disorders rather than an effect of having a disorder is reasonable. P300 amplitude reductions in those with early-onset substance problems appear to preexist the development of heavy substance involvement or other externalizing psychopathology ( Carlson et al., 2007 ) rather than reflect a potentially more severe effect of substance use at younger ages influencing neurodevelopment. A study of genetic and environmental influences on P300 amplitude development in twin pairs from the same sample reported on herein ( Carlson & Iacono, 2006 ) found that 87% of the variability in the stable variance associated with intercept was because of individual differences in genetic effects. All of the correlations between slope and intercept appeared to be because of a common set of genes influencing both growth parameters. Furthermore, all of the heritable influence on P300 amplitude measured at each age could be attributed to genetic effects that were shared across age. As the relationship between externalizing and P300 amplitude in adolescence appears to be entirely genetically mediated ( Hicks et al., 2007 ) and all of the genetic influence on amplitude in this age range is mediated by intercept and slope, it is likely that the reduced intercept of the affected participants seen in the present study reflects a genetically influenced vulnerability rather than the effects of having a disorder. Generalizability of Findings The present study was focused only on men, and potential gender effects on risk and P300 change could not be examined. Results with high-risk young women are less consistent than those seen with high-risk young men. Although some support has accrued for a possible Gender × Risk Status interaction (e.g., Hill, Muka, Steinhauer, & Locke, 1995 ; Steinhauer & Hill, 1993 ; Hill & Steinhauer, 1993 ), amplitude reduction may also be present in high-risk girls (e.g., Carlson et al., 2002 ; Reese & Polich, 2003 ; van der Stelt, Geesken, Gunning, Snel, & Kok, 1998 ; Yoon, Iacono, Malone, & McGue, 2006 ). The results of the present study should not be generalized to young women. These findings may not generalize to studies of P300 at different ages or across a wider number of measurements. Examination of growth curves in past studies of visual P300 amplitude change suggested that a linear model is reasonable for the three time points examined here, and unless it is of a fairly large effect size, a quadratic term would be difficult to detect with three time points. A quadratic component of change was supported by Hill et al. (1999) using the same task as we did but with a wider and largely earlier age range (7–18 years) measured on up to five occasions. Nonlinear influences on P300 change may be important across a broader range of ages than was assessed here, and quadratic change in particular may differentiate at-risk groups. Whether such effects exist for MTFS participants will become clear as subsequent assessments are completed in this longitudinal investigation. P300 Amplitude and Risk-Group Differences at Later Ages Hill et al. (1999) predicted that the growth curves of their male participants at risk for alcoholism would converge with those of low-risk participants at age 22. In the present study, P300 amplitude of sons with high and low paternal risk differed significantly until age 20.87 years (although projected P300 values had not converged by this age or even by age 25; see Figure 3 and Figure 4a ). The high- and intermediate-risk groups differed significantly between the ages of 17.63 and 20.15 years. This being the case, it is unclear why reductions are seen in abstinent adults with alcoholism as a function of familial risk at later ages ( H. L. Cohen, Wang, Porjesz, & Begleiter, 1995 ; Patterson, Williams, McLean, Smith, Schaeffer, 1987 ; Pfefferbaum, Ford, White, & Mathalon, 1991 ; although see contrary findings in Glenn, Parsons, & Sinha, 1994 , and Keenan, Freeman, & Harrell, 1997 ). Similarly, if the deviant trajectory is related to risk for antisocial personality disorder, it is unclear why P300 reductions are observed in adult antisocial men (e.g., L. O. Bauer, O’Connor, & Hesselbrock, 1994 ; Costa et al., 2000 ; O’Connor, Bauer, Tasman, & Hesselbrock, 1994 ). This latter set of findings may be because of developmental differences in the activity of P300 generators leading to changes in the topography of P300, as suggested by L. O. Bauer and Hesselbrock (2003) . They found cross-sectional evidence consistent with a shift to greater involvement of frontal P300 generators with increasing age in young people without conduct problems, but no such shift in those with conduct problems. Reduced amplitude at parietal sites might normalize with adulthood, but frontal reductions would become more apparent. Intriguingly, in a study of twins assessed longitudinally at ages 16 and 18, genetic influences on P300 amplitude in young men tended to decrease with age for posterior sites but to increase for frontal sites ( van Beijsterveldt, van Baal, Molenaar, Boomsma, & de Geus, 2001 ). This is consistent with a genetically influenced anterior shift in P300 generators. Furthermore, although differences in topography with age are not universally supported, Mullis et al. (1985) suggested that late adolescence to early adulthood is associated with a visual P300 amplitude shift from posterior to anterior sites in a nonpsychiatric sample. The present study and the studies by Hill and colleagues ( Hill et al., 1999 ; Hill & Shen, 2002 ) that support a decreasing difference between high-and low-risk children into adulthood focused exclusively on posterior sites. Future work looking longitudinally at shifts in the contribution of different neural generators in high-and low-risk participants is needed to clarify this issue. Speculation on Developmental Significance Differences in the trajectory of P300 amplitude development related to familial externalizing may provide important clues to developmental processes in the etiology of disinhibited behavior disorders. Given that the intercept and slope of P300 growth trajectories in adolescence and early adulthood are significantly influenced by a common set of genes, these trajectories may provide clues about how genetic influences on individual differences in the development of the central nervous system lead to vulnerability for a disorder. For example, past research involving functional MRI ( Rangaswamy et al., 2004 ) and current source localization ( Chen et al., 2007 ) has suggested a link between P300 amplitude reduction related to alcoholism risk and frontal cortex abnormalities, including areas involved in working memory systems ( McCarthy, Luby, Gore, & Goldman-Rakic, 1997 ). The genetic risk indexed by P300 amplitude development may be mediated by developmental differences in such brain systems. Antisocial men appear to have reduced gray matter in the prefrontal cortex ( Raine, Lencz, Bihrle, LaCasse, & Colletti, 2000 ), and it is unclear when this difference first manifests. Adolescence is a crucial period when the prefrontal cortex is thought to mature through the processes of targeted cell body loss, synaptic pruning, and increased axonal myelination of pathways connecting it to other brain structures ( Lewis, 1997 ; Sowell et al., 2001 ; Spear, 2000 ). Normatively larger visual P300 might be seen at early ages because more neurons are recruited in the stimulus processing involved in the updating of memory, stimulus categorization, or inhibition of inappropriate responses required to perform a task like the one used in the present study. Fewer neurons may be required with increasing maturity because of greater refinement and efficiency of the cortical areas activated (e.g., Durston et al., 2006 ; Tamm, Menon, & Reiss, 2002 ). If P300 amplitude reflects genetic influences on the development of frontally influenced cognitive processes, a more restrictive limit on the degrees of freedom available for neuronal and synaptic pruning in vulnerable children could limit the rate of decrease possible for P300 amplitude over adolescence and into early adulthood. The limited number of relevant neurons activated could thus be reflected by both the lower intercept (fewer neurons) and the smaller slope (fewer cells to lose) seen in the young men at risk for externalizing problems reported here. On one hand, such a limitation could reflect an etiologically important functional restriction reflected by the trajectory of the high-risk young men. On the other hand, the inverse correlation of intercept with slope might reflect a psychophysiological floor effect consistent with the law of initial values ( Raykov, 1995 ; Wilder, 1967 ). If the difference between target and nontarget P300 amplitude is largely a function of the extent to which relevant neural systems are engaged rather than different systems being activated, this floor does not appear to have been met for the target P300 amplitude of the high-risk men during the age range examined. The difference between target and nontarget P300 ( M = 10.78 µV) was significant and sizable for this group relative to the differences in target amplitude from age 17 to age 24 ( M = 3.72 µV). It is unlikely that the trajectory of P300 development observed in these young men merely reflects an artifact of having a low initial intercept. Conclusion P300 amplitude decreased with age from mid-adolescence to early adulthood. Rather than reflecting a specific vulnerability to alcohol dependence, a deviant trajectory of P300 change was associated with severe paternal externalizing psychopathology, consistent with prior findings suggesting a general vulnerability for externalizing disorder. By age 21, P300 amplitude no longer significantly distinguished the risk groups, with the low- and severe-risk trajectory groups projected to converge later in young adulthood, potentially limiting the utility of P300 amplitude as an endophenotype with older samples. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings in independent samples. Given past support indicating that the heritable influences on amplitude during this age range can be attributed to the effects of common genetic influences on the intercept and slope of amplitude growth trajectories, future research may profit by searching for genes that influence P300 change rather than cross-sectional amplitude. Our understanding of what puts people at risk for the various externalizing disorders might be advanced by use of P300 amplitude trajectory as a source of hypotheses regarding relevant neural and cognitive processes that change over the same time course.  Discussion Consistent with past findings ( Hill et al., 1999 ), visual P300 amplitude decreased significantly with age from 17 to 24 years in young men from a community sample. This finding is consistent with the results of studies using the same task as used here ( Hill et al., 1999 ; Katsanis et al., 1996 ), as well as with a variety of other visual tasks ( Courchesne, 1978 ; Friedman et al., 1989 ; Johnson, 1989 ; Mullis, Holcomb, Diner, & Dykman, 1985 ; Taylor, 1993 ). As we had predicted, developmental trajectories differed significantly across groups of young men varying in paternal history of externalizing problems. On the basis of findings of Hill and colleagues ( Hill & Shen, 2002 ; Hill et al., 1999 ), we had predicted that sons with heightened risk would have developmental trajectories characterized by lower intercepts and less change with age relative to those at low risk. Consistent with P300 amplitude being associated with risk for an externalizing dimension underlying vulnerability for substance use disorders ( Hicks et al., 2007 ; Patrick et al., 2006 ) and findings that paternal AAB is a more severe indicator of externalizing than of alcohol dependence ( Krueger et al., 2005 ), our hypothesis would predict the greatest difference between the sons of fathers with AAB and a low-risk group. This was the case. Men with a paternal history of alcohol dependence but no AAB or drug dependence would be predicted as being intermediate between the low-risk group and the paternal AAB group. Although there was a trend for a difference in trajectory between this intermediate paternal externalizing risk group and the paternal AAB group, this was not statistically significant by conventional standards. This intermediate-risk group also did not differ significantly from the low-risk group. The ability to detect externalizing risk group differences may require a fairly large difference in the level of paternal externalizing severity. Those who had developed an externalizing or earlier onset substance disorder had significantly different trajectories from those who did not have such a disorder. To a large extent, diagnostic status of the offspring is confounded with risk in this sample. Almost 92% of the paternal AAB group and 76.4% of the intermediate-risk group had at least one earlier onset substance disorder or other externalizing disorder. There are several reasons why an interpretation of trajectory differences as reflecting a vulnerability contributing to these disorders rather than an effect of having a disorder is reasonable. P300 amplitude reductions in those with early-onset substance problems appear to preexist the development of heavy substance involvement or other externalizing psychopathology ( Carlson et al., 2007 ) rather than reflect a potentially more severe effect of substance use at younger ages influencing neurodevelopment. A study of genetic and environmental influences on P300 amplitude development in twin pairs from the same sample reported on herein ( Carlson & Iacono, 2006 ) found that 87% of the variability in the stable variance associated with intercept was because of individual differences in genetic effects. All of the correlations between slope and intercept appeared to be because of a common set of genes influencing both growth parameters. Furthermore, all of the heritable influence on P300 amplitude measured at each age could be attributed to genetic effects that were shared across age. As the relationship between externalizing and P300 amplitude in adolescence appears to be entirely genetically mediated ( Hicks et al., 2007 ) and all of the genetic influence on amplitude in this age range is mediated by intercept and slope, it is likely that the reduced intercept of the affected participants seen in the present study reflects a genetically influenced vulnerability rather than the effects of having a disorder. Generalizability of Findings The present study was focused only on men, and potential gender effects on risk and P300 change could not be examined. Results with high-risk young women are less consistent than those seen with high-risk young men. Although some support has accrued for a possible Gender × Risk Status interaction (e.g., Hill, Muka, Steinhauer, & Locke, 1995 ; Steinhauer & Hill, 1993 ; Hill & Steinhauer, 1993 ), amplitude reduction may also be present in high-risk girls (e.g., Carlson et al., 2002 ; Reese & Polich, 2003 ; van der Stelt, Geesken, Gunning, Snel, & Kok, 1998 ; Yoon, Iacono, Malone, & McGue, 2006 ). The results of the present study should not be generalized to young women. These findings may not generalize to studies of P300 at different ages or across a wider number of measurements. Examination of growth curves in past studies of visual P300 amplitude change suggested that a linear model is reasonable for the three time points examined here, and unless it is of a fairly large effect size, a quadratic term would be difficult to detect with three time points. A quadratic component of change was supported by Hill et al. (1999) using the same task as we did but with a wider and largely earlier age range (7–18 years) measured on up to five occasions. Nonlinear influences on P300 change may be important across a broader range of ages than was assessed here, and quadratic change in particular may differentiate at-risk groups.

Fewer neurons may be required with increasing maturity because of greater refinement and efficiency of the cortical areas activated (e.g., Durston et al., 2006 ; Tamm, Menon, & Reiss, 2002 ). If P300 amplitude reflects genetic influences on the development of frontally influenced cognitive processes, a more restrictive limit on the degrees of freedom available for neuronal and synaptic pruning in vulnerable children could limit the rate of decrease possible for P300 amplitude over adolescence and into early adulthood. The limited number of relevant neurons activated could thus be reflected by both the lower intercept (fewer neurons) and the smaller slope (fewer cells to lose) seen in the young men at risk for externalizing problems reported here. On one hand, such a limitation could reflect an etiologically important functional restriction reflected by the trajectory of the high-risk young men. On the other hand, the inverse correlation of intercept with slope might reflect a psychophysiological floor effect consistent with the law of initial values ( Raykov, 1995 ; Wilder, 1967 ). If the difference between target and nontarget P300 amplitude is largely a function of the extent to which relevant neural systems are engaged rather than different systems being activated, this floor does not appear to have been met for the target P300 amplitude of the high-risk men during the age range examined. The difference between target and nontarget P300 ( M = 10.78 µV) was significant and sizable for this group relative to the differences in target amplitude from age 17 to age 24 ( M = 3.72 µV). It is unlikely that the trajectory of P300 development observed in these young men merely reflects an artifact of having a low initial intercept.  Conclusion P300 amplitude decreased with age from mid-adolescence to early adulthood. Rather than reflecting a specific vulnerability to alcohol dependence, a deviant trajectory of P300 change was associated with severe paternal externalizing psychopathology, consistent with prior findings suggesting a general vulnerability for externalizing disorder. By age 21, P300 amplitude no longer significantly distinguished the risk groups, with the low- and severe-risk trajectory groups projected to converge later in young adulthood, potentially limiting the utility of P300 amplitude as an endophenotype with older samples. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings in independent samples. Given past support indicating that the heritable influences on amplitude during this age range can be attributed to the effects of common genetic influences on the intercept and slope of amplitude growth trajectories, future research may profit by searching for genes that influence P300 change rather than cross-sectional amplitude. Our understanding of what puts people at risk for the various externalizing disorders might be advanced by use of P300 amplitude trajectory as a source of hypotheses regarding relevant neural and cognitive processes that change over the same time course.
