EGFR and HER2 Genomic Gain in Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer After Surgery Impact on Outcome to Treatment with Gefitinib and Association with EGFR and KRAS Mutations in a Japanese Cohort Background Sensitivity to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and frequency of activation mutations in EGFR is lower in Caucasian than Asian non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Increased EGFR gene copy numbers evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been reported as predictor of clinical benefit from EGFR-TKIs in Caucasian NSCLC patients. This study was carried out to verify whether EGFR FISH had similar performance in Japanese patients. Methods A cohort of 44 Japanese patients with recurrent NSCLC after surgery was treated with gefitinib 250 mg daily. The cohort included 48% females and 52% never-smokers; 73% had prior chemotherapy and 57% had stage III-IV at the time of surgery. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histology (86%). FISH was performed using the EGFR/Chromosome Enumeration Probe 7 and PathVysion DNA probes (Abbott Molecular). Specimens were classified as FISH positive when showing gene amplification or high polysomy (?4 copies of the gene in ?40% of tumor cells). Tumor response to gefitinib was assessed by RECIST for 33 patients with measurable diseases. Results Twenty-nine tumors (66%) were EGFR FISH+ and 23 (53%) were HER2 FISH+. Overall response rate was 52%, representing 65% of EGFR FISH+ patients and 29% of EGFR FISH+ patients ( p = 0.0777). Survival was not impacted by the EGFR FISH ( p = 0.9395) or the HER2 FISH ( p = 0.0671) status. EGFR FISH= was significantly associated with HER2 FISH+ ( p = 0.015) and presence of EGFR mutation ( p = 0.0060). EGFR mutation significantly correlated with response ( p < 0.0001) and survival after gefitinib ( p = 0.0204). EGFR and HER2 FISH status were not associated with KRAS mutation. Conclusion Frequency of EGFR FISH+ status was higher and its predictive power for TKI sensitivity was lower in this Japanese cohort than in Western NSCLC cohorts. These findings support differences in the mechanisms of EGFR pathway activation in NSCLC between Asian and Caucasian populations. Confirmation of these results in larger cohorts is warranted.  RESULTS Clinical and demographical characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . The patients were evenly split between males and females, never or ever smokers and with early or advanced stage disease. Adenocarcinoma histology and poorly or moderately differentiated histologic grade were prevalent. Most patients had not received prior chemotherapy. Median disease free interval after surgery was 375 days, median survival after gefitinib treatment was 562 days, and 66% of patients were alive at the time of last follow up. EGFR FISH and mutation status in relation to demographics are summarized in Table 2 . While EGFR mutation was associated with female gender, never-smoking status, and adenocarcinoma histology, none of these was related with EGFR-FISH status. Distribution of patients through the FISH categories is illustrated in Figure 1 A for the EGFR gene and Figure 1 B for the HER2 gene. The majority of tumors (29 cases [66%]) were EGFR FISH positive, predominantly due to a large representation of tumors with high polysomy (23 cases, 52%, Figure 2 A ) rather than gene amplification (6 cases, 14%, Figure 2 B ). Also, a high number of tumors (23 cases, 53%) were positive for HER2 FISH, of which 21 cases (48%) were represented by high polysomy and only 2 cases (5%) by gene amplification (illustrated in Figure 2 C ). EGFR and HER2 patterns were significantly associated ( p = 0.015): 19 cases (43%) of tumors were positive and 11cases (25%) were negative for both genes, while 14 cases (32%) had discordant patterns; EGFR FISH positives were more likely to be HER2 FISH positives (19/29 = 66%) than EGFR FISH negatives (4/15 = 27%). Overall, the specimens with amplification of the EGFR or HER2 genes exhibited clusters of loosely associated signals ( Figures 2 B , C ) indicating that the amplification occurred as homogenously staining regions. However, one specimen displayed EGFR gene amplification as numerous, diffuse signals mimicking the extrachromosomal double minutes ( Figure 2 D ). Heterogeneity for both EGFR and HER FISH patterns was common, with tumor foci showing nuclei with high copy numbers (including gene amplification) interspaced with nuclei with low copy numbers. The association between FISH patterns and response to the gefitinib treatment for 33 patients with measurable diseases is shown in Table 3 . Response to gefitinib was marginally higher in EGFR FISH positive (65%) than negative (29%) patients ( p = 0.0777). Patients with EGFR gene amplification had a trend towards better benefit (response in 4 of 4 = 100%) than patients with high polysomy (response in 9 of 16 = 56%). HER2 FISH positive pattern trended no impact, including 47% of responders ( p = 0.4426). Response rate was 62% of patients with EGFR and HER2 FISH positive tumors, in 45% of patients with EGFR or HER2 FISH positive tumors, and in 44% of patients EGFR and HER2 FISH negative tumors. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was not significantly associated with EGFR or HER2 FISH positivity ( Table 4 ). Overall survival was not associated with patterns of EGFR FISH ( p = 0.93) or HER2 FISH ( p = 0.69), as shown in Figure 3 A , B . EGFR FISH+ patients with high polysomy (score 5) and true gene amplification (score 6) did not differ regarding survival ( p = 0.6607; Figure 3 C ). Among these 44 NSCLC patients, 27 (61%) had activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene and, among 41 who were tested for KRAS mutations, 5 (12%) had point mutations in codons 12 or 13. Table 3 also shows tumor response according to presence or absence of EGFR and KRAS mutations, both individually and in combination with EGFR FISH. EGFR mutation was significantly associated with tumor response ( p < 0.0001) and prolonged TTF ( p < 0.0001) or survival ( p = 0.02; Figure 4 A and Table 4 ). EGFR FISH positivity was significantly associated with presence of EGFR mutation ( p = 0.0060). Patients with EGFR mutation were more likely to be EGFR FISH positive (22/27 = 81%) than patients with wild type EGFR (7/17 = 41%). EGFR mutations were present in all 6 tumors with EGFR gene amplification and in 16 out of 23 tumors with EGFR high polysomy (70%). Response rate was 81% of 16 cases positive for both EGFR FISH and mutation and all 4 EGFR FISH negative/EGFR mutation positive cases responded to gefitinib ( Table 3 ). Conversely, none of the 4 patients with KRAS mutation (none of whom were EGFR FISH positive) or of the 13 patients with EGFR wild type (4 of whom were EGFR FISH positive) benefited from gefitinib treatment. Presence of KRAS mutation was significantly associated with TTF ( p = 0.0248) but not with lack of response ( p = 0.0995) or overall survival ( p = 0.4156, Figure 4 B ).

DISCUSSION The EGFR FISH positive status had a borderline association to response of gefitinib treatment, but no impact on survival in this cohort of Japanese NSCLC patients. These results do not support a predictive role of the established EGFR FISH assay to gefitinib sensitivity in Japanese NSCLC patients. This observation contrasts with previous findings in Caucasian NSCLC populations obtained by our group 12 , 20 , 21 and others, 14 that had identified EGFR genomic gain by FISH as a significant predictor of outcome to EGFR-TKIs. In the current study, EGFR mutation was highly predictive of both response and survival to gefitinib. Lack of predictive value of EGFR FISH or EGFR gene copy numbers as assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction have also been reported by Korean 17 and Japanese 26 groups. Therefore, there seems to be ethnic differences as to whether EGFR genomic gain is predictive for response or survival after geftinib treatment. The clinical and demographical characteristics of this Japanese cohort were distinctive, including high proportion of female, never smokers, early stage disease, no prior chemotherapy, and adenocarcinomas. Unselected cohorts of Asian origin usually have higher frequency of females (40% 27 ) and never smokers (40% 27 ) than Caucasians (34% for females, 9% for never smokers according to Kobrinsky et al. 28 ). In addition, this cohort had one of the highest reported frequencies of EGFR FISH+ tumors (68%) and EGFR mutations (61%). Taken only studies that evaluated gene copy numbers by FISH with identical or similar scoring criteria, the frequency of EGFR FISH+ tumors ranged from 44 to 48% in Asian patients 17 , 26 , 29 and from 32 to 45% in Caucasian NSCLCs. 14 , 21 EGFR activating mutations are well known to be more prevalent in Asian (40–50% of adenocarcinomas 27 , 30 ) than Caucasian NSCLCs (10% of adenocarcinomas 25 ). Altogether, these findings substantiate the interesting hypothesis that there are ethnicity-associated molecular peculiarities in NSCLC. The two EGFR gene markers, activating mutation and genomic gain, were significantly correlated in this cohort. Association between EGFR gene amplification and activating mutations has been reported in NSCLC cell lines 31 and clinical specimens of Caucasian 12 and Asian origins. 17 , 32 Furthermore, the selective amplification of the mutant allele was verified in the cell lines H3255, H827, PC-9, KT-2, KT-4 and Ma-1, 31 as well as in Asian patients. 32 These findings support the hypothesis that there is a selection of cells carrying the amplification of the mutant allele in lung tumorigenesis. Interestingly, high EGFR copy numbers due to chromosomal aneusomy or structural rearrangements (high polysomy) were also associated with mutations in this cohort and in Caucasian NSCLC. 33 Status of the HER2 gene in NSCLC has been poorly explored and discrepant results have been reported in association with outcome to EGFR-TKIs. 34 In this cohort, HER2 genomic gain showed up as a negative impact factor for survival after gefinitib treatment, in contrast to our previous results in an Italian cohort. 34 Conversely, none of the five KRAS mutant tumors showed treatment efficacy in this study, in agreement with previously findings that KRAS mutations are primary resistance factors to EGFR-TKIs. 18 , 35 In summary, the study showed that the EGFR FISH scoring criteria proposed for stratification of NSCLC for therapy with EGFR-TKIs was not effective in Japanese patients as in Caucasian patients. Confirmation of these results in larger cohorts is warranted and investigation of factors that may underlie distinct molecular mechanisms of activation of the EGFR pathway in these populations should be investigated.
