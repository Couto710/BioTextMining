Improvement of Canine Islet Yield by Donor Pancreas Infusion with a p38MAPK Inhibitor 1 , 2 Background The activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) is implicated in cold ischemia-reperfusion injury of donor organs. The islet isolation process, from pancreas procurement through islet collection, may activate p38MAPK leading to cytokine release and islet damage. This damage may be prevented by treating pancreata with a p38MAPK inhibitor (p38IH) prior to cold preservation. Methods Pancreata removed from Beagle dogs were infused with UW solution containing either the p38IH, SB203580 and Pefabloc (n=6) or vehicle (DMSO and Pefabloc) alone (n=7), through the pancreatic duct and preserved using the two-layer method. After 20–22 hours, islets were isolated and 3000 IEQ/kg were autotransplanted into the corresponding dog to monitor glucose metabolism. Results P38IH-treated pancreata yielded significantly more islets than control pancreata (IEQ/g: 2,134±297 vs. 1,477±145 IEQ/g or 65,012±9,385 vs. 45,700±5,103 IEQ/Pancreas; p<0.05). Apoptotic ?-cell percentages assessed by LSC were lower in p38IH-treated than the controls (44±9.4% vs. 61.6±4.8%, p<0.05). TNF-? expression assessed by RT-PCR was significantly lower in the p38IH-treated group than controls. All dogs (3000 IEQ/kg) transplanted with p38IH-treated islets (n=5) became euglycemic vs. 4 of 5 dogs that received untreated islets. Plasma C-peptide levels following glucagon challenge were higher in animals receiving p38IH-treated islets (n=5) vs. untreated islets (n=4) (0.40±0.78 vs. 0.21±0.05 ng/mL, p<0.05). Conclusions Infusion of pancreata with UW solution containing p38IH through the duct prior to peservation suppresses cytokine release, prevents ? cell apoptosis, and improves islet yield significantly with no adverse effect on islet function following transplantation. P38IH treatment of human pancreata may improve islet yield for use in clinical transplantation.  Introduction Islet transplantation has shown promise as a treatment of type 1 diabetes ( 1 – 5 ). However, it has been hindered by the inability to isolate a sufficient number of islets from a single pancreas. Two or more donor organs are usually required to achieve insulin independence ( 2 , 4 , 5 ). New strategies must be developed to increase islet yield, maintain high islet quality, and prevent ? cell death. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor –? (TNF-?) and interleukon-1? (IL-1?) are known to induce ? cell apoptosis ( 6 – 7 ). Production of these cytokines is associated with the activation of the p38MAPK pathway ( 8 – 11 ). TNF-? production, stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS), was markedly reduced in spleen cells of MAPK-activated protein kinase ?2 (MK2)-knockout mice ( 9 – 12 ). MK2 is a downstream target of p38MAPK and the major kinase responsible for posttranscriptional regulation of cytokine biosynthesis. TNF-? production can also be suppressed by use of a p38MAPK inhibitor ( 13 ). We have previously reported that the inhibition of p38MAPK activation by p38IH SB203580 in vitro suppresses TNF-? and IL-1? production in human islets stimulated by LPS, interferon-? (IFN-?), and IL-1? or TNF-?. This in turn improves islet viability in vitro and alleviates primary islet graft non-function following transplantation into diabetic immunodeficient mice ( 14 ). Resident macrophages and monocytes are implicated as major producers of cytokines in isolated human islets. The islet vascular endothelium is also known to produce cytokines ( 14 ). Moreover, pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced by contaminating ductal ( 8 , 14 ) and acinar cells ( 15 – 17 ) present in islet preparations. Movahedi et al. reported the release of TNF-? and IL-1? from pancreatic duct cells ( 8 ). Blinman et al. showed an up-regulation of TNF-? production in acinar cells prepared by collagenase digestion, as well as a significant reduction with the addition of a p38IH ( 17 ). Several lines of evidence suggest that damage to donor organs starts at brain death and is accelerated during ischemia, cold preservation, and reperfusion of recipient blood ( 18 , 19 ). Free radicals and inflammatory mediators appear to play major roles in organ damage. p38MAPK is known to be activated by cytokines and environmental stresses ( 20 – 23 ), and is likely involved in the production of an inflammatory mediator throughout these processes. Inhibition of p38MAPK activation has been shown to alleviate cold ischemia-reperfusion injury and improve graft function of various organs in experimental transplantation models ( 24 , 26 ). The involvement of p38MAPK is further supported by the resistance of the heart from MK2?/? knockout mice to cold ischemia-reperfusion injury ( 27 ). These mice are genetically incapable of activating p38MAPK. The objective of this study is to test if the islet protective effect of p38IH could be utilized to improve islet yields by treating procured pancreata with the agent. Our hypothesis is that the infusion of donor pancreata with a p38IH immediately after procurement reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production during cold preservation and islet isolation procedures, prevents ?-cell apoptosis, and improves the overall islet quality and yield. To test this, canine pancreata were infused with University of Wisconsin (UW) solution containing the p38IH SB203580 through the pancreatic duct and stored using the two-layer method overnight prior to islet isolation. The islets were isolated and their function was measured in vivo through auto-transplantation. This study demonstrated improvement in islet yield through treatment of the donor pancreas with a p38IH.  Materials and Methods Experimental animals Male Beagle dogs, ages ranging from 12 – 16 months and weights of 10.4 – 17.5 kg, were used as pancreas donors and islet autograft recipients. All dogs were purchased from qualified commercial sources. The care and use of animals was carried out in accordance with “Animal Welfare Act Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” of the National Institutes of Health as well as other applicable federal, state, and local laws, guidelines, and policies. The study protocols and animal procedures were approved by the Research Animal Care Committee of the Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope and the Los Angeles Biomedical Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Pancreatectomy and recipient treatment Dogs were randomly divided into p38IH-treated (experimental) and control-treated groups consisting of six dogs each. Acepromazine and atropine were used as premedication. Anesthesia was induced with a ketamine/diazepam cocktail, and maintained with isoflurane. The pancreatectomy was performed as described previously ( 28 ). While leaving the major vascular connections intact, angiocatheters (#20 or 22 gauge, Insyte-W, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, U.S.A.) were inserted into the uncus and body pancreatic ducts before dissecting the pancreas from the duodenum. After pancreas removal, a heparinized silicon tube (Fuji Systems Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was secured in the portal vein, with the other end of the tube brought out under the skin and secured in a subcutaneous pocket for the islet infusion performed the next day. Recipients were treated by oral administration of Simvastatin (20 mg/day, Merck &Co. Whitehouse Station, N.J., U.S.S.) from day ?2 to day 14 based on our previous results ( 28 ) and 200–300 mg of pancreatic enzymes mixed with low-fat, highly-digestible meal. No exogenous insulin was given after islet transplantation. Pancreas treatment by infusing UW solution containing p38 inhibitor After taking small samples of tissue for immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the pancreas was weighed and infused with UW solution (1 mL/g) supplemented with 0.4 mM Pefabloc (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) through the catheters placed in the duct. A p38 inhibitor, SB203580 (20 mM, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.) dissolved in DMSO (1 µL/mL, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) was added to the UW solution of the experimental group and vehicle, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and Pefabloc only in the control group. After infusion, the pancreas was placed in a two-layer container and kept on ice until islet isolation was performed 20–22 hours later. Islet isolation and tissue sampling Prior to collagenase injection, small tissue samples were collected for in vitro tests. Islets were isolated using the two-step digestion method ( 29 ) using a single collagenase lot (Collagenase P; lot # 8552352341, Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN, U.S.A.), purified by discontinuous gradient centrifugation on EuroFicoll (Cellgro, Mediatech, Herndon, VA, U.S.A.) using a COBE2991 Cell Processor (COBE, Denver, CO, U.S.A.), counted, and converted to IEQ (number of islets equivalent to 150 µm in diameter). Samples were taken from purified islets as well as the post purification discard for in vitro tests. Islet transplantation Immediately after isolation, purified islets (3,000 IEQ/kg) were suspended in phenol red-free HBSS containing 5% autologous serum and infused into the portal vein of the corresponding pancreas donor through the pre-placed silicon tube. Metabolic studies after islet transplantation Following islet transplantation, fasting blood glucose levels of the recipients were measured daily. Intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was performed prior to and 4 weeks after transplantation by an i.v. injection of glucose (0.5 g/kg) and collecting blood samples at 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 45 min for glucose and insulin measurements. The glucagon-stimulated insulin release assay was performed by an i.v. injection of 1 mg glucagon and collecting blood samples at 0 and 6 minutes in tubes containing Trasylol (Bayer HealthCare, West Haven, CT, U.S.A.). Plasma samples were stored at ?20°C until insulin or C-peptide measurement. Insulin levels were measured using an ELISA kit for human insulin (ALPCO, Salem, NH, U.S.A.) and serum C-peptide levels were measured using an radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit specific for dog C-peptide (Linco Research/Millipore, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.). Perfusion assay for in vitro islet function Overnight-cultured islets were packed between Cytodex Beads (Sigma) in a column and washed by a basal Krebs-Ringer’s buffer (3 mM glucose) at 0.8 mL/min for 60 min. The effluent was collected for the next 20 min in 1 min fractions before switching to a stimulation medium (20 mM glucose). The stimulation index was calculated by dividing the total insulin amount released in stimulation medium by the total insulin amount released in basal medium for the same time period. Real-time PCR for TNF-? expression RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, U.S.A.) and Trizol reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, U.S.A.). After RNA quantitation, 1 µg of RNA was diluted with diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water and reverse transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.). TNF-? expression was quantitated using SYBR GREEN PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.) on a 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using forward primer 5’-CCTCCAACTAATCAGCCCTCT -3’ and reverse primer: 5’-ACATGAGCTACTGGCTTGTCACT -3’. ?-actin was amplified using forward primer 5’-GGCCGAGGACTTTGATTGTA -3’ and reverse primer 5’- CCTTCTCTGCAGGGAGAAAC -3’. All data were normalized to the housekeeping gene, ?-actin. A comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method, ??Ct, was used to compare relative expression levels ( 30 ). Western blot for detection of p38MAPK activation Tissue samples were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, snap frozen on dry ice, and stored at ?80°C until use. Western blot for the p38MAPK activation assay was performed as previously described ( 31 ). Briefly, the frozen-stored cells were lysed and the supernatant recovered from the lysate was eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. The sample was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filters (Immobilon, Millipore, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.). The membrane was immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against p38MAPK and phospho-p38MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, U.S.A.). The bound antibodies were visualized with rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase using LumiGLO (Cell Signaling Technology). Laser scanning cytometry(LSC) for determination of ? cell apoptosis Apoptotic cells were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining of pancreas or islet paraffin sections using the ApopTag® Plus Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, U.S.A.). The sections were then immunostained for insulin using a Cy5-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno-Research, West Grove, PA, U.S.A.). Nuclei were contoured using the 405 nm laser based on the 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) fluorescence. The slides were scanned through a 40x objective at a 0.5 µm step using the iCys laser scanning cytometer and iCys 3.2.5 software (Compucyte, Cambridge, MA. U.S.A.). The insulin-positive cells were recorded using the 633 nm laser and the TUNEL nuclear staining using the 488 nm laser. Cells co-stained for insulin and TUNEL were defined as apoptotic ? cells and their percentage was obtained from the histogram. The percentage of apoptotic ?-cells was calculated by dividing the insulin-TUNEL double-positive cell number by the total insulin-positive cell number.

Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired Student’s t test and P<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Statistical analysis Results are expressed as the mean and standard error of the mean.

Results Donor and pancreas characteristics Islets were isolated from 15 canine pancreata: 8 of 15 pancreata were treated with p38IH and the remaining 7 were control-treated. A pilot study using one of the 7 control dogs confirmed that transplantation of 3500 IEQ/kg of cold-preserved autologous islets reversed diabetes when the recipient was treated with Simvastatin. Among the 8 experimental dogs, the isolation failed in 2 dogs, one due to difficulty to cannulate the pancreatic head duct and the other due to a COBE failure. The characteristics of the donors and pancreata of the remaining 12 islet isolations (6 each in control and experimental group) used in the study are summarized in table 1 . There were no notable differences between the p38IH-treated and control-treated groups in donor age, body weight, and pancreas weight. The operation time (the period from entering the abdomen to the removal of the pancreas), the warm ischemic time (from arterial ligation to the pancreas placement in the two-layer container), and the cold ischemic time (from the organ placement in the container to the start of the islet isolation) were also comparable between groups. Five of 6 islet preparations from the experimental and control groups were used for autotransplantation. Two islet preparations were not transplanted and used for in vitro studies due to aggressive animal behavior (experimental group) and an insufficient islet number yielding only 1485 IEQ/kg (untreated group). Pancreas treatment with p38MAPK inhibitor significantly improves islet yield Islets were isolated by the same team using a single collagenase lot following the same procedure. The islet number was counted by the same investigator immediately after isolation. The warm and cold digestion periods were comparable in both groups ( Table 1 ). As shown in Fig. 1 , the total islet yield was 65,012±9,385 IEQ/pancreas (with ranges of 35,000 – 98,175) in the p38IH-treated group and 45,700±5,103 (26,498 – 58,152) IEQ/pancreas in the control group (n=6 each, p=0.046). Islet yield/g of pancreas weight was 2,134±297 (997.2 – 2,837.4) IEQ/g from p38IH-treated pancreata, but only 1,477±145 (1,118.1 – 1,889.3) IEQ/g from the control pancreata (p=0.037). Over 1,900 IEQ/g of islets were isolated from 5 of 6 p38IH-treated pancreata, but 0 of 6 of the control-treated pancreata. Islet purity was similar (78.8±7.2% vs. 83.8±2.4% for treated pancreata vs. control pancreata, p=0.10). These results show an increased islet recovery resulting from p38IH infusion of pancreata after more than 20 hours of cold preservation. Infusion of p38 inhibitor suppresses p38MAPK activation in the pancreas Western blot analysis detected the strong expression of p-p38MAPK in control-treated pancreatic tissue after overnight cold preservation, indicating the activation of p38MAPK. In contrast, the p38 pathway activation was attenuated by p38IH as shown by the diminished phospholyrated-p38 (p-p38) in the treated samples ( Fig. 2 ). Infusion of pancreata with p38MAPK inhibitor prevents ? cell apoptosis To assess ? cell apoptosis, tissue samples collected at several time points were processed for immunohistochemistry and LSC analysis. Results of LSC revealed that less than 1% of ?-cells were apoptotic in both the p38IH-treated and control-treated pancreatic tissues before and after cold preservation (data not shown). However, within the first 10 min of warm digestion the number of apoptotic ?-cells increased rapidly in control tissues ( Fig. 3A-C ). At the end of the digestion process, the number of TUNEL-positive ?-cells was significantly higher in the control vs. the p38IH group (61.6±4.8% vs. 44.1±9.4%, P<0.05). Following purification, the apoptotic ?-cell percentage dropped to 2.4±0.8% in the p38IH-treated group and 4.3±2.3% in the control group (P=0.21), indicating that a significant number of apoptotic ?-cells were cleared through the islet purification process. One day after culture, the apoptotic ?-cell percentage remained at a similar level in the treated group (3.5±1.0%), but was highly variable in the control group (9.4±9.2%). Infusion of p38 inhibitor suppresses TNF-? mRNA expression in the pancreas One of the potential mechanisms involved in the protection of ? cell apoptosis may be the suppression of intra-tissue cytokine production and release. To examine such possibilities, the TNF-? expression was measured by RT-PCR. TNF-? expression in the freshly removed pancreata was essentially the same in all samples ( Fig. 4 ). After 20–22 hours of cold preservation, the TNF-? level in the control tissues more than doubled and further increased after 10 min of warm collagenase digestion. In contrast, the TNF-? level remained unchanged in p38IH-treated tissue throughout. After islet purification, the TNF-? expression dropped markedly in the control-treated tissue such that levels were not significantly different between the two groups. P38MAPK inhibitor-treatment of the pancreas does not alter islet function To confirm that the pancreas treatment with p38IH had no adverse effect on islet function, islets from the p38IH-treated and control-treated pancreata were tested in vitro for glucose-stimulated insulin release response in a perfusion system, and in vivo by transplanting them into the pancreatectomized, corresponding dog for the ability to reverse diabetes and maintain euglycemia. Glucose-stimulated insulin release response in vitro In perfusion, islets from both groups showed the normal insulin release profile to 20 mM glucose and the stimulation indices were higher in the p38IH-treated group (3.22±0.66, n=6) than in the control-treated group (2.35±0.61, n=4) but with no significant difference (p=0.32). The islet numbers from two control pancreata were just enough for transplantation and therefore not tested in a perfusion system. Islet autotransplantation The pilot study with a Beagle dog confirmed our earlier results ( 28 ) that 3000 IEQ/kg was sufficient for diabetes reversal and that this number of islets could be isolated from a single cold-preserved pancreas. Therefore, 3000 IEQ/kg was used as a standard dose for transplantation. Four pancreata in both groups yielded 3000 IEQ/kg transplantation and the islets were infused into the portal vein of the corresponding recipient. One p38IH-treated pancreas yielded 2671 IEQ/kg and one control pancreas 2775 IEQ/kg, but both were also transplanted. Thus, five islet autotransplantations were performed in both groups. For all dogs receiving p38IH-treated islets and 4 of 5 dogs receiving control-treated islets, the fasting blood glucose levels remained below 120 mg/dL during the one month observation period ( Fig. 5A ). One control dog receiving 3000 IEQ/kg became hyperglycemic within one week and was terminated on day 14. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests IVGTT was performed prior to pancreatectomy on five randomly selected dogs as normal, pre-pancreatectomy controls. IVGTT was performed at the end of the study (day 28) on all islet recipients. In normal dogs, blood glucose levels returned to <150 mg/dL within 45 min of glucose injection. Dogs receiving p38IH-treated islets had fasting blood glucose levels similar to normal dogs, but at 45 min blood glucose levels were higher than 150 mg/dL. Fasting blood glucose levels in dogs receiving control-treated islets were below 150 mg/dL but higher than the other groups, the glucose disappearance was slower and the glucose level was >200 mg/dL at 45 min ( Fig. 5B ). Serum insulin levels were far lower in both islet autografted groups than the normal control levels throughout the IVGTT. Insulin levels from 0 to 30 min were higher in the p38IH group than in the control group ( Fig. 5C ). Glucagon-stimulated C-peptide release The values obtained from 5 dogs that underwent IVGTT before pancreatectomy were used as normal controls of glucagon stimulation tests. The tests were performed on the autograft recipients at the end of experiment (on day 27). The serum C-peptide levels before and 6 min after glucagon challenge were 0.27±0.167 ng/mL and 0.45±0.056 ng/mL in the normal group, 0.20±0.503 ng/mL and 0.40±0.780 ng/mL in the p38IH-treated (n=5), and 0.21±0.077 ng/mL and 0.21±0.045 ng/mL in the control treated group (n=4), respectively. Glucagon stimulation increased serum C-peptide levels in normal and p38IH-treated groups and the 6-min values were not significantly different between the two groups, whereas glucagon did not significantly increase C-peptide release in dogs receiving the control-treated islets and the 6-min values were significantly lower than p38IH-treated group (p<0.05).  Results Donor and pancreas characteristics Islets were isolated from 15 canine pancreata: 8 of 15 pancreata were treated with p38IH and the remaining 7 were control-treated. A pilot study using one of the 7 control dogs confirmed that transplantation of 3500 IEQ/kg of cold-preserved autologous islets reversed diabetes when the recipient was treated with Simvastatin. Among the 8 experimental dogs, the isolation failed in 2 dogs, one due to difficulty to cannulate the pancreatic head duct and the other due to a COBE failure. The characteristics of the donors and pancreata of the remaining 12 islet isolations (6 each in control and experimental group) used in the study are summarized in table 1 . There were no notable differences between the p38IH-treated and control-treated groups in donor age, body weight, and pancreas weight. The operation time (the period from entering the abdomen to the removal of the pancreas), the warm ischemic time (from arterial ligation to the pancreas placement in the two-layer container), and the cold ischemic time (from the organ placement in the container to the start of the islet isolation) were also comparable between groups. Five of 6 islet preparations from the experimental and control groups were used for autotransplantation. Two islet preparations were not transplanted and used for in vitro studies due to aggressive animal behavior (experimental group) and an insufficient islet number yielding only 1485 IEQ/kg (untreated group). Pancreas treatment with p38MAPK inhibitor significantly improves islet yield Islets were isolated by the same team using a single collagenase lot following the same procedure. The islet number was counted by the same investigator immediately after isolation. The warm and cold digestion periods were comparable in both groups ( Table 1 ). As shown in Fig. 1 , the total islet yield was 65,012±9,385 IEQ/pancreas (with ranges of 35,000 – 98,175) in the p38IH-treated group and 45,700±5,103 (26,498 – 58,152) IEQ/pancreas in the control group (n=6 each, p=0.046). Islet yield/g of pancreas weight was 2,134±297 (997.2 – 2,837.4) IEQ/g from p38IH-treated pancreata, but only 1,477±145 (1,118.1 – 1,889.3) IEQ/g from the control pancreata (p=0.037). Over 1,900 IEQ/g of islets were isolated from 5 of 6 p38IH-treated pancreata, but 0 of 6 of the control-treated pancreata. Islet purity was similar (78.8±7.2% vs. 83.8±2.4% for treated pancreata vs. control pancreata, p=0.10). These results show an increased islet recovery resulting from p38IH infusion of pancreata after more than 20 hours of cold preservation. Infusion of p38 inhibitor suppresses p38MAPK activation in the pancreas Western blot analysis detected the strong expression of p-p38MAPK in control-treated pancreatic tissue after overnight cold preservation, indicating the activation of p38MAPK. In contrast, the p38 pathway activation was attenuated by p38IH as shown by the diminished phospholyrated-p38 (p-p38) in the treated samples ( Fig. 2 ). Infusion of pancreata with p38MAPK inhibitor prevents ? cell apoptosis To assess ? cell apoptosis, tissue samples collected at several time points were processed for immunohistochemistry and LSC analysis. Results of LSC revealed that less than 1% of ?-cells were apoptotic in both the p38IH-treated and control-treated pancreatic tissues before and after cold preservation (data not shown). However, within the first 10 min of warm digestion the number of apoptotic ?-cells increased rapidly in control tissues ( Fig. 3A-C ). At the end of the digestion process, the number of TUNEL-positive ?-cells was significantly higher in the control vs. the p38IH group (61.6±4.8% vs. 44.1±9.4%, P<0.05). Following purification, the apoptotic ?-cell percentage dropped to 2.4±0.8% in the p38IH-treated group and 4.3±2.3% in the control group (P=0.21), indicating that a significant number of apoptotic ?-cells were cleared through the islet purification process. One day after culture, the apoptotic ?-cell percentage remained at a similar level in the treated group (3.5±1.0%), but was highly variable in the control group (9.4±9.2%). Infusion of p38 inhibitor suppresses TNF-? mRNA expression in the pancreas One of the potential mechanisms involved in the protection of ? cell apoptosis may be the suppression of intra-tissue cytokine production and release. To examine such possibilities, the TNF-? expression was measured by RT-PCR. TNF-? expression in the freshly removed pancreata was essentially the same in all samples ( Fig. 4 ). After 20–22 hours of cold preservation, the TNF-? level in the control tissues more than doubled and further increased after 10 min of warm collagenase digestion. In contrast, the TNF-? level remained unchanged in p38IH-treated tissue throughout. After islet purification, the TNF-? expression dropped markedly in the control-treated tissue such that levels were not significantly different between the two groups. P38MAPK inhibitor-treatment of the pancreas does not alter islet function To confirm that the pancreas treatment with p38IH had no adverse effect on islet function, islets from the p38IH-treated and control-treated pancreata were tested in vitro for glucose-stimulated insulin release response in a perfusion system, and in vivo by transplanting them into the pancreatectomized, corresponding dog for the ability to reverse diabetes and maintain euglycemia. Glucose-stimulated insulin release response in vitro In perfusion, islets from both groups showed the normal insulin release profile to 20 mM glucose and the stimulation indices were higher in the p38IH-treated group (3.22±0.66, n=6) than in the control-treated group (2.35±0.61, n=4) but with no significant difference (p=0.32). The islet numbers from two control pancreata were just enough for transplantation and therefore not tested in a perfusion system. Islet autotransplantation The pilot study with a Beagle dog confirmed our earlier results ( 28 ) that 3000 IEQ/kg was sufficient for diabetes reversal and that this number of islets could be isolated from a single cold-preserved pancreas. Therefore, 3000 IEQ/kg was used as a standard dose for transplantation. Four pancreata in both groups yielded 3000 IEQ/kg transplantation and the islets were infused into the portal vein of the corresponding recipient. One p38IH-treated pancreas yielded 2671 IEQ/kg and one control pancreas 2775 IEQ/kg, but both were also transplanted. Thus, five islet autotransplantations were performed in both groups. For all dogs receiving p38IH-treated islets and 4 of 5 dogs receiving control-treated islets, the fasting blood glucose levels remained below 120 mg/dL during the one month observation period ( Fig. 5A ). One control dog receiving 3000 IEQ/kg became hyperglycemic within one week and was terminated on day 14. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests IVGTT was performed prior to pancreatectomy on five randomly selected dogs as normal, pre-pancreatectomy controls. IVGTT was performed at the end of the study (day 28) on all islet recipients. In normal dogs, blood glucose levels returned to <150 mg/dL within 45 min of glucose injection. Dogs receiving p38IH-treated islets had fasting blood glucose levels similar to normal dogs, but at 45 min blood glucose levels were higher than 150 mg/dL. Fasting blood glucose levels in dogs receiving control-treated islets were below 150 mg/dL but higher than the other groups, the glucose disappearance was slower and the glucose level was >200 mg/dL at 45 min ( Fig. 5B ). Serum insulin levels were far lower in both islet autografted groups than the normal control levels throughout the IVGTT. Insulin levels from 0 to 30 min were higher in the p38IH group than in the control group ( Fig. 5C ). Glucagon-stimulated C-peptide release The values obtained from 5 dogs that underwent IVGTT before pancreatectomy were used as normal controls of glucagon stimulation tests. The tests were performed on the autograft recipients at the end of experiment (on day 27). The serum C-peptide levels before and 6 min after glucagon challenge were 0.27±0.167 ng/mL and 0.45±0.056 ng/mL in the normal group, 0.20±0.503 ng/mL and 0.40±0.780 ng/mL in the p38IH-treated (n=5), and 0.21±0.077 ng/mL and 0.21±0.045 ng/mL in the control treated group (n=4), respectively. Glucagon stimulation increased serum C-peptide levels in normal and p38IH-treated groups and the 6-min values were not significantly different between the two groups, whereas glucagon did not significantly increase C-peptide release in dogs receiving the control-treated islets and the 6-min values were significantly lower than p38IH-treated group (p<0.05).  Donor and pancreas characteristics Islets were isolated from 15 canine pancreata: 8 of 15 pancreata were treated with p38IH and the remaining 7 were control-treated. A pilot study using one of the 7 control dogs confirmed that transplantation of 3500 IEQ/kg of cold-preserved autologous islets reversed diabetes when the recipient was treated with Simvastatin. Among the 8 experimental dogs, the isolation failed in 2 dogs, one due to difficulty to cannulate the pancreatic head duct and the other due to a COBE failure. The characteristics of the donors and pancreata of the remaining 12 islet isolations (6 each in control and experimental group) used in the study are summarized in table 1 . There were no notable differences between the p38IH-treated and control-treated groups in donor age, body weight, and pancreas weight. The operation time (the period from entering the abdomen to the removal of the pancreas), the warm ischemic time (from arterial ligation to the pancreas placement in the two-layer container), and the cold ischemic time (from the organ placement in the container to the start of the islet isolation) were also comparable between groups. Five of 6 islet preparations from the experimental and control groups were used for autotransplantation. Two islet preparations were not transplanted and used for in vitro studies due to aggressive animal behavior (experimental group) and an insufficient islet number yielding only 1485 IEQ/kg (untreated group).

The tests were performed on the autograft recipients at the end of experiment (on day 27). The serum C-peptide levels before and 6 min after glucagon challenge were 0.27±0.167 ng/mL and 0.45±0.056 ng/mL in the normal group, 0.20±0.503 ng/mL and 0.40±0.780 ng/mL in the p38IH-treated (n=5), and 0.21±0.077 ng/mL and 0.21±0.045 ng/mL in the control treated group (n=4), respectively. Glucagon stimulation increased serum C-peptide levels in normal and p38IH-treated groups and the 6-min values were not significantly different between the two groups, whereas glucagon did not significantly increase C-peptide release in dogs receiving the control-treated islets and the 6-min values were significantly lower than p38IH-treated group (p<0.05).  Discussion One key to achieving successful insulin-independence following islet transplantation is having a sufficient donor islet mass. The number and quality of islets recovered from an isolation are influenced by many factors. Islet damage may start as early as the onset of brain death ( 18 , 32 ). Central catastrophic injuries to the donor evoke an upsurge of catecholamines, which lead to peripheral vasoconstriction, tissue ischemia, and release of stress hormones and inflammatory mediators, all leading to oxidative stress in various organs. At the time of procurement, donor organs are exposed to sudden temperature changes, followed by ischemic conditions for several hours. During islet isolation, the pancreatic tissues are warmed up to 37°C for enzymatic digestion which may cause cell damage similar to ischemia-reperfusion injury of other organs. It has been shown that ischemia-reperfusion injury to the kidney can be prevented and long-term graft function can be improved by treatment of the donor organ with free radical scavengers such as superoxide dismutase ( 18 , 32 ), cytoprotective heme-oxygenase-1 ( 33 ), or a free-radical scavenger MCI-186 (Edaravone) ( 34 ). The addition of a p38MAPK inhibitor to the cold preservation solution has also been shown to reduce post-ischemia reperfusion injury in heart ( 35 ), lung ( 36 ), and liver ( 37 ) transplants. The treatment of the donor pancreas with p38IH would have similar effect and reduce damage to islets during cold preservation and isolation. Even though brain death-induced stress factors were excluded in our experimental model, we showed the activation of the p38 pathway in cold preserved donor pancreata ( Fig. 2 ). The p38MAPK activation is associated with increased TNF-? expression and ?-cell apoptosis ( Figs. 3 and 4 ). The TUNEL-positive ?-cell percentage further increased (>50%) during warm collagenase digestion. This indicates that tissue damage similar to ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs to the islet cells during the isolation process. Infusion of the pancreas with p38IH reduced the level of p-p38MAPK in the cold-preserved tissue and kept TNF-? expression at the low level throughout the islet isolation process. In this study, a simple injection of p38IH into the pancreatic duct showed a significant beneficial effect. P38IH in UW solution may have been retained in the duct system and penetrated into the surrounding cells to a certain extent. We expect that p38IH infused through the arterial system may be more effective and plan to use this route in human pancreata. However, despite the suppressed TNF-? expression, the ?-cell apoptosis was not totally prevented. We found that other cytokines such as IL-1?, IL-6 and IL-8 were not up-regulated in both p38IH-treated and untreated groups (data not shown). Cytokines are produced by many cell types in the pancreas and an intra-ductal infusion of p38IH may not effectively reach all those cells. It is also likely that ? cells are damaged by factors unrelated to p38MAPK. Paraskevas, et al. ( 38 ) have reported the elevated levels of phosphorylated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) as well as p38MAPK in cultured canine islets. Immediately after isolation the JNK activity was highest and declined during culture to a baseline, while the activity of p38MAPK was low immediately after isolation, but progressively increased with time during a 7 day culture. Noguchi, et al. ( 39 , 40 ) have shown that the inhibition of JNK activation prevents islet loss during isolation. Therefore, a cocktail of p38IH and JNK inhibitors may have synergistic effect for islet protection. Macrophages/monocytes are considered to be the major cytokine producers in the pancreas, but acinar cells likely play a significant role in cytokine production as well. Blinman, et al. ( 17 ) have reported that rat pancreatic acini express mRNA of multiple cytokines and other inflammatory mediators including TNF-?, IL-6, monocytes chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and macrophage-inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). The expression of these cytokines is very low in pancreatic tissue biopsied from normal rats, but is markedly increased in the excised pancreas and further upregulated during acinar cell preparation by collagenase digestion. Either a p38IH or MG-132, an inhibitor of NF?B, suppressed the acinar cell cytokine expression. Therefore, it is likely that the ?-cell damage during islet preparation largely derives from cytokines released by acinar cells and that the major effect of p38IH injected through the pancreatic duct may be on suppression of acinar cell activation. The decreased TNF-? expression in islets after purification may be attributable to the elimination of the majority of acinar cells. The half life of p38IH also affects results. The persistence of TNF-? suppression throughout the isolation process indicates a long-lasting effectiveness of p38IH SB203580. No significant difference in TNF-? expression in overnight-cultured experimental and control islets may be due to the decay of p38IH effect, decreased acinar and monocytes numbers, or both. However, it is likely due to the decay of p38IH effect, since we have shown significant improvement of cultured human islets by adding p38IH in the culture medium ( 41 ). The obvious question is the potential adverse effect of p38IH on islet function. In a perfusion system in vitro , P38IH-treated islets showed normal insulin release response to high glucose stimulation. In vivo , all p38IH-treated autologous islets reversed diabetes and maintain euglycemia when transplanted, while the same number of control islets maintained euglycemia in 4 of the 5 recipients ( Fig 5 ). The results of IVGTT and glucagon-stimulation tests also proved that islets from the p38IH-treated pancreata maintain normal (or better) function as islets from the untreated pancreata. Both canine and human islets have been shown to contain comparable levels of MAPK expression and have a similar response to mechanical and chemical stress in isolation procedure ( 42 ). Therefore, it would be reasonable to think that events similar to those found with canine pancreas/islets occur during cold preservation of human pancreata and islet isolation. P38 inhibitor has been extensively investigated for developing new anti-inflammatory drugs, since p38MAPK plays a central role. This has lead to the development of p38IHs and some of them have been in clinical trials. These p38IHs would be available for the treatment of donor pancreata. In summary, p38MAPK is activated during cold-preservation of canine pancreata. An intra-ductal infusion of p38IH down-regulates p38MAPK phosphorylation, reduces TNF-? production, and reduces ?-cell apoptosis during islet isolation. The use of p38IH also significantly improves islet yields while maintaining normal islet function. Inhibition of p38MAPK activation during human pancreas procurement using a similar method may improve the donor islet yield and contribute to the improvement of the outcome of clinical islet transplantations.
