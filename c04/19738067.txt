Integrin ?2 Mediates Selective Metastasis to the Liver Cancers display distinct patterns of organ-specific metastasis. Comparative analysis of a broad array of cell membrane molecules on a liver-metastasizing subline of B16 melanoma versus the parental B16-F0 revealed unique up-regulation of integrin ?2. The direct role of integrin ?2 in hepatic metastasis was shown by comparison of high versus low-expressing populations, antibody blockade, and ectopic expression. Integrin ?2–mediated binding to collagen type IV (highly exposed in the liver sinusoids) and collagen type IV–dependent activation of focal adhesion kinase are both known to be important in the metastatic process. Analysis of primary colorectal cancers as well as coexisting liver and lung metastases from individual patients suggests that integrin ?2 expression contributes to liver metastasis in human colorectal cancer. These findings define integrin ?2 as a molecule conferring selective potential for formation of hepatic metastasis, as well as a possible target to prevent their formation.  Introduction Most cancer patients ultimately die from the metastatic burden of their disease. Thus, understanding the molecular interactions involved in both general and organ-specific metastasis is critical. The metastatic process is dynamic and involves numerous complex interactions between tumor and host. Tumors will develop metastatic disease only if all steps in this cascade of sequential biological events occur. The metastatic process can be formalized into a series of discrete stages as illustrated by the model introduced by Fidler and colleagues ( 1 ). These stages include escape from the primary tumor, intravasation into the lymphatic or vascular systems, survival in the circulation, avoidance of host defense mechanisms, arrest at a new site, extravasation into the tissue, and finally growth at the new site ( 2 ). Tumor progression and metastasis depend on factors intrinsic to the tumor cell such as growth factors and receptors, extracellular matrix proteins, proteases, chemokines, and cellular adhesion molecules, as well as host factors. Cellular adhesion molecules are important in various biological processes, including organogenesis, tissue homeostasis, wound healing, and inflammatory/immune responses ( 3 ). Adhesion molecules including cadherins, integrins, and immunoglobulin superfamily molecules have been implicated in many of the steps in the metastatic cascade ( 4 ). Adhesion molecules are expressed on the cell surface and mediate adhesion between cells of the same or different types. Among the most important adhesion molecules implicated in metastasis are the integrins, heterodimeric transmembrane receptors found throughout metazoan development ( 5 ). In humans, there are 24 different functional integrins formed by the different combination of 18 ? and 8 ? subunits ( 6 , 7 ). Many integrins bind to components of the extracellular matrix such as laminins, collagens, and fibronectin. Integrins are involved in various aspects of cellular behavior ( 8 ). Integrin-mediated cell adhesions can cause cell signaling that trigger calcium fluxes, activate tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinases, inositol lipid metabolism, and regulate the activity of GTPases that control the actin cytoskeleton ( 8 ). Besides mediating stable adhesion, integrins play a role in cellular motility ( 9 ). Cell migration is essential for embryonic development, immune responses, and tissue repair, whereas dysregulated migration characterizes metastatic cancers ( 10 ). Integrin-mediated migration and interactions with other cells such as endothelial cells contributes to tumor cell invasion and metastasis ( 11 ). During tumor progression, tumor cells gain and lose expression of specific integrins depending on the environmental restraints encountered. The liver is one of the most important targets for organ-specific metastasis in many cancer types and is commonly the sole site of metastasis for gastrointestinal cancers. It is likely that the portal drainage of the gastrointestinal tract is partially responsible for the high rate of liver metastasis in gastrointestinal tumors but additional molecular variables are undoubtedly critical in determining whether a given cancer will metastasize to the liver. To define cell membrane molecules mediating liver metastasis, we used the classic approach of repetitive in vivo metastasis selection to derive liver-metastasizing sublines of a tumor with normally low intrinsic potential for hepatic metastasis. Analysis of a broad array of cell membrane adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors revealed that the integrin ?2 (CD49b) was uniquely up-regulated relative to the nonliver-metastasizing parental line. Antibody blockade and forced expression of integrin ?2 showed a direct role in liver metastasis, collagen type IV binding, and collagen type I–dependent activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a critical intracellular kinase involved in the metastatic process ( 12 , 13 ). Analysis of metastatic colon tumors from patients provided evidence that integrin ?2 plays a role in liver metastasis in human cancer.  Materials and Methods Mice and tumor cell lines Female C57BL/6J (B6) mice and BALB/c mice (ages 8–10 wk) were purchased from the National Cancer Institute. B16 is a melanoma cell line of B6 origin. Colon tumor 26 cells (CT26) are murine colon adenocarcinoma cells derived from BALB/c mice ( 14 ). 4T1 breast tumor cells are spontaneously developed in BALB/c mice. All tumor cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. These tumor cell lines were cultured as previously described ( 15 ). Hepatic metastasis model The hepatic metastasis model has been previously described ( 15 – 17 ). All experimental subjects were treated ethically in accordance with an approved animal use protocol. B16 subpopulation with propensity to form hepatic metastases Two to 3 wk after tumor injection, metastatic deposits within the liver were resected, mechanically dispersed into a single-cell suspension, and cultured in vitro . These tumor cells were then reinjected into naïve B6 mice again. After repeating this procedure eight times, a cell line with high propensity to form hepatic nodules was established, B16-KY8 ( Fig. 1A ). B16-KY4 (KY4) was an intermediate cell line derived from B16-F0 by four passages in the hepatic metastasis model. Cell growth velocity B16 melanoma subpopulations were seeded at an initial concentration of 1 × 104/10 mL into flasks and their contents counted after 3, 6, and 9 d. Flow cytometric analysis of cell surface markers The following staining and blocking antibodies were used. Cells were blocked with Fc receptor antibody and stained with: anti CD49b HM?2, CD49b DX5, CD29, CD49a, CD49d, CD49e, CD49f, CD51, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD25, CD31, CD34, CD43, CD44, CD54, CD62L, CD106, CD137, CD154, CD184, CD195, ANNEX V, B7H1, ICOS, Gr-1, LPAM-1 (BD Biosciences), B7RP-1, NK1.1, OX40L (eBioscience), CCR10 (Capralogics, Inc.), c-Met (Upstate), and Integrin ?7 (R&D Systems), and the cells were counted for specific cell surface marker expression on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Matched isotype control antibodies were used. All staining experiments involving anti integrin ?2 were done with antibody from clone HM ?2. Blocking of CD49b Integrin ?2 was blocked by purified anti CD49b (HM ?2) antibody (BD Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:10. The efficacy of blocking was >99% and confirmed by flow cytometry (Data not shown). Cell attachment assay to collagen type IV–coated plates We assessed the ability of B16-F0 and B16-KY8 cells to attach to collagen type IV, collagen type I/III, fibronectin, and laminin-coated (Sigma-Aldrich) plates. Each reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted to 50 ?g/mL with 0.02N acetic acid and added to plates. This was incubated at room temperature for 2 h, then rinsed with PBS. The cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/plate and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the plates were washed gently with PBS twice to remove the nonadherent B16 cells. Western blotting The cells were plated in Petri dish with or without collagen type IV–coated for 30, 60, 90, 120, and 240 min, then washed twice with PBS and resuspended and incubated for 30 min at 4°C with 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L NaCl, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). The amount of proteins was measured by Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Proteins (100 Ag/lane) from the cell lysates were applied to 4% to 15% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) and blotted with primary antibodies as follows: anti-FAK polyclonal antisera 5158 (Romer lab), antiTyr 397 phosphorylated FAK (Santa Cruz), Akt (pan), and Phospho-Akt (Ser473; Cell Signaling). Flow cytometric sorting of integrin ?2 high and low cells Integrin ?2 high and Integrin ?2 low expressing B16-KY8 cells were sorted using a FACSVantage SE cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Those cells in the highest and lowest 10 percentile of the total population were recovered and used. Gene transfer of integrin ?2 to B16-F0 A plasmid vector encoding murine Integrin ?2 was kindly provided by Dr. Jeff Bergelson (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). B16-F0 was transfected with murine integrin ?2–expressing plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resultant cell lines, B16-SKY, expresses high levels of integrin ?2 and B16-SKYP expresses similar levels of integrin ?2 as KY8. Human tissue samples and immunohistochemical labeling for CD49b Deidentified clinicopathologic data and paraffin-embedded materials from subjects with metastatic colonic cancer were collected from the Surgical Pathology Files of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. The slides were cooled for 15 min then incubated with a 15 ?g/mL dilution of monoclonal antibody to CD49b (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at room temperature. Immunohistochemical labeling of each tissue section was scored on an intensity scale of 0 to 3, with 0 corresponding to no positive cells were observed, 1 corresponding to weak positive labeling (labeling best seen at 10× power or greater), 2 corresponding to unequivocal positive labeling, and 3 to intense positive labeling. The percentage of cells with positive labeling was also scored from 1% to 100%. The H score is obtained by multiply the relative staining intensity by the percent of cells staining. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed by a Mann-Whitney U test method and an analysis of ?2. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results are presented as mean ± SEM.  Results <italic>In vivo</italic> selection of liver metastasizing subline of B16 melanoma B16-F0 melanoma cells were subjected to eight rounds of in vivo selection for liver metastasis using an intrasplenic injection route ( Fig. 1A ). Intrasplenic injection of B16-F0 generates very few hepatic metastases; instead demonstrating massive peritoneal dissemination ( Fig. 1B–D ). A rare liver metastasis was explanted and expanded in vitro followed by intrasplenic readministration ( Fig. 1A ). After four (B16-KY4) and eight rounds of selection (B16-KY8), tumor lines were established. B6 mice were challenged with four different tumor lines (B16-F0, B16-KY4, B16-KY8, and B16-F10, a subline selected for lung metastatic potential) in the hepatic metastasis model. At the time of death, mice were necropsied and inspected for patterns of metastasis. Mice challenged with B16-F0 and B16-F10 had marked peritoneal dissemination of their disease and relatively small disease burden in the liver. In striking contrast, mice challenged with B16-KY8 had significant disease burden in the liver with little peritoneal dissemination. Mice challenged with B16-KY4 had an intermediate pattern of metastasis ( Fig. 1B ). To better quantify hepatic metastases, B6 mice challenged with the B16-F0, B16-F10 B16-KY4, and B16-KY8 lines were necropsied on day 17 after intrasplenic injection, and livers were inspected and weighed ( Fig. 1C and D ). The B16-KY8 challenged mice had significantly higher liver weights and hepatic disease burden compared with the other groups ( P < 0.02). In addition to having more disease in the liver, the peritoneal cavity of the mice challenged with B16-KY8 cells had much less extrahepatic dissemination. B16-F0, B16-F10 B16-KY4, and B16-KY8 cell lines were found to have similar growth rates as assessed by cell doubling time ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), and this cannot be the cause of increased tumor volume in the liver. Assessment of cell surface molecule expression associated with liver metastasis The four B16 cell lines were analyzed by flow cytometry to survey a broad panel of adhesion molecules. We concentrated on molecules related to cell attachment, and previously studied molecules described as important in the metastatic process. Of over 30 membrane molecules analyzed quantitatively for surface expression, including chemokine receptors previously implicated in hepatic homing, only integrin ?2 (also known as CD49b) was differentially expressed on B16-KY8 cells relative to the other three B16 cell lines ( Supplementary Fig. S2A–D ). Because integrin ?2 combines in a heterodimeric complex with integrin ?1 (also known as CD29) to form VLA2, we also performed flow cytometric assays to test differences in expression of integrin ?1. The four B16 cell lines expressed similar amounts of integrin ?1 but only the B16-KY8 cell line expressed higher amounts of integrin ?2 ( Fig. 2A ). B16-KY8 cells were sorted into two populations: integrin ?2 high and low expressing cells. Mice were challenged with these cells using the intrasplenic injection model and then sacrificed on day 21. When the high integrin ?2 cells were used, 30% of mice had limited peritoneal disease. In contrast, 100% of mice receiving intrasplenic injection of the low integrin ?2 cells developed peritoneal dissemination. Although 100% of mice in both groups developed hepatic metastases, the number of nodules in the liver was significantly higher in the group with the high integrin ?2 tumor cells challenge compared with the group challenged with the low integrin ?2 B16-KY8 cells ( Fig. 2B ). At the same time, the number of peritoneal nodules in the high integrin ?2–injected mice was much less than the number in the low integrin ?2 (high, 0.7 ± 0.5; low, 31.1 ± 6.4; Fig. 2B ). When the high integrin ?2 cells were used to challenge mice via tail vein injection, a route that allows for initial passage of tumor cells through the lungs, 27% of the mice developed liver metastasis and all 100% developed lung metastases. When the low integrin ?2 cells were used to challenge mice via tail vein injection, 100% developed lung metastases but none developed liver metastases (data not shown). The number of lung metastases did not significantly differ between the two groups (data not shown). These results provided evidence that integrin ?2 expression might indeed enhance formation of liver metastasis. Integrin ?2 blockade inhibits hepatic metastasis, whereas ?2 integrin overexpression promotes selective hepatic metastasis Blocking B16-KY8 cells with anti–integrin ?2 antibody in the hepatic metastasis model was studied. Although treatment of B16-KY8 cells by blocking with anti–integrin ?2 antibody did not completely eliminate hepatic metastasis, it significantly reduced the number relative to treatment with the isotype control antibody (isotype, 27 ± 6; blocked, 18 ± 6; P = 0.013; data not shown). Importantly, anti–integrin ?2 antibody treatment concomitantly increased peritoneal dissemination of B16-KY8 (isotype, 2 ± 3; blocked, 24 ± 17; Fig. 3A ), demonstrating that integrin ?2 blockade did not reduce generic metastatic potential but rather shifted metastasis away from the liver. To further show that integrin ?2 can promote selective hepatic metastasis, we transfected B16-F0 with the integrin ?2 gene to generate the B16-SKY line expressing high levels of integrin ?2 and the B16-SKYP line expressing similar levels of integrin ?2 to B16-KY8 ( Fig. 3A ). We first used B16-SKY to challenge mice by both intrasplenic and i.v. routes. After intrasplenic injection, B16-SKY produced significantly more hepatic metastastic nodules than B16-F0 (although not as many as B16-KY8; B16-F0 versus B16-KY8, P = 0.0006; B16-F0 versus B16-SKY, P = 0.0023; Fig. 3A ). We also studied the effect of blocking integrin ?2 expression on B16-SKY on the pattern of metastases after intrasplenic and tail vein injection. The most notable effect of blocking integrin ?2 expression on B16-SKY in the hepatic metastasis model was to increase the rate of peritoneal metastases (the number of nodules: B16-SKY with isotype antibody, 5.1 ± 9.8; B16-SKY blocked, 17.8 ± 6.1; P = 0.0011), although there was additionally a decrease in liver metastases (the number of nodules: B16-SKY with isotype antibody, 11.6 ± 1.1; B16-SKY blocked, 7.1 ± 1.3; P = 0.02; Fig. 3A ). Blocking integrin ?2 expression on B16-SKY decreased the rate of hepatic metastases and increased the rate of peritoneal metastases after i.v. injection ( Fig. 3B ). There was no difference in the number of pulmonary metastases, further supporting the notion that enhancement of metastatic potential by integrin ?2 expression is selective for the liver. To determine whether physiologic levels of integrin ?2 mediate selective liver metastasis, we injected B16-SKY and B16-SKYP with or without blockade of integrin ?2 via hemispleen, we then counted the number of nodules in the liver on day 17 after injection. The number of nodules in B16-SKYP was similar to those in B16-SKY (B16-SKYP, 12.3 ± 1.8; B16-SKY, 11.6 ± 1.1; not statistically significant). This tropism was abrogated with blockade of integrin ?2 expression (100% blockade of integrin ?2 expression at the time of tumor injection; B16-SKYP blocked, 5.2 ± 1.6; B16-SKY blocked, 7.1 ± 1.3; B16-SKY versus B16-SKY blocked, P = 0.02; B16-SKYP versus B16-SKYP blocked, P = 0.008; Fig. 3C ). In previous studies to develop the intrasplenic injection model of hepatic metastases, we used a BALB/c-derived colon cancer, CT26, which, unlike B16-F0 or B16-F10, shows a high degree of liver metastasis and little peritoneal dissemination. CT26 was found to naturally express integrin ?2, and we therefore studied whether antibody blockade of integrin ?2 altered the metastatic pattern. Indeed, treatment of CT26 with anti–integrin ?2 antibody before injection altered the metastatic pattern, diminishing liver metastasis (CT26 isotype control, 12.5 ± 2.4; CT26 blocked, 3.8 ± 1.5; P = 0.009) and increasing peritoneal dissemination (CT26 isotype control, 3.2 ± 1.9; CT26 blocked, 11.7 ± 2.4; P = 0.014; Fig. 4A and B ). To evaluate additional tumors naturally expressing integrin ?2, we tested an integrin ?2 expression breast cancer, 4T-1 in the hemispleen model. 4T-1 efficiently generates liver metastases, and treatment with anti–integrin ?2 antibody before injection showed the same findings as CT26 and B16-KY8 (4T-1 isotype control, 60.4 ± 11.8; 4T-1 blocked, 13.2 ± 9.4; P = 0.03; Fig. 4C ). These results strengthen the notion that enhancement of hepatic metastasis by integrin ?2 is not a phenomenon specific to the B16 tumor. Integrin ?2 expression enhances binding to collagen type IV Integrins ?2 mediates collagen binding, and the liver is particularly rich in type IV collagen. We therefore asked whether integrin ?2 up-regulation might enhance collagen type IV binding. An attachment assay to collagen type IV–coated plates was per formed using B16-F0 and B16-KY8. The counting was performed in a “blinded” fashion. The B16-F0 group displayed low numbers of attached tumor cells on the collagen type IV–coated plate (138 ± 17). In contrast, the B16-KY8 group displayed a >6-fold increase in attachment (881 ± 95, P < 0.001; 8 per group; Fig. 5A and B ). When either B16-KY8 or B16-SKYP was first treated with anti– integrin ?2 blocking antibody, attachment to collagen type IV–coated plates was significantly inhibited [B16-KY8, 786 ± 30; B16-KY8 blocked, 163 ± 42; P < 0.0001; B16-SKYP, 829 ± 28; B16-SKYP blocked, 142 ± 39; P < 0.0001; 8 high power field (HPF) per group; Fig. 5C ]. Additionally, both B16-SKYP and B16-KY8 cells had high affinity for collagen type IV (B16-F0, 102 ± 12; B16-KY8, 367 ± 53; B16-SKYP, 502 ± 178; both B16-F0 versus B16-KY8 and B16-F0 versus B16-SKYP, P < 0.003; 4 HPF per group). These cells were also incubated on collagen type I/III or fibronectin-coated plates; there was very little attachment and no enhancement by integrin ?2 expression. Integrin ?2 expression correlated with a slight increase in attachment to laminin-coated plates. (uncoated: B16-F0, 7 ± 2; B16-KY8, 10 ± 2; B16-SKYP, 3 ± 1; Laminin: B16-F0, 47 ± 1; B16-KY8, 81 ± 7; B16-SKYP, 114 ± 8; both B16-F0 versus B16-KY8 and B16-F0 versus B16-SKYP, P < 0.003; collagen type I/III: B16-F0, 2 ± 1; B16-KY8, 4 ± 1; B16-SKYP, 3 ± 1; Fibronectin: B16-F0, 2 ± 1; B16-KY8, 19 ± 7; B16-SKYP, 6 ± 1; 4 HPF per group; Fig. 5C ). Integrin ?2 enhances collagen type IV–dependent FAK activation FAK plays a major role in cell motility and has been shown to be activated by engagement of a number of integrins, including integrin ?2, and is thought to be an important factor in the metastatic process. Indeed, attachment of B16-KY8 and B16-SKY to collagen type IV–coated plates resulted in significant FAK activation (as measured by tyrosine phosphorylation at Y397), peaking at 90 min, whereas B16-F0 cells plated on collagen IV failed to activate FAK ( Fig. 6A ). FAK activation was collagen type IV dependent ( Fig. 6A and B ) and specific, because another kinase involved in metabolic regulation of tumor cells, AKT, was equally activated in B16-F0, KY8, or SKY and was not affected by binding to collagen IV (data not shown). This study shows that induction of integrin ?2 results in collagen type IV–dependent FAK activation and provides a potential mechanistic basis for its role in mediating selective hepatic metastasis. Correlation between integrin ?2 expression and hepatic metastasis in human colorectal cancer We also analyzed colorectal tumors from patients with simultaneous liver and lung metastases. Metastases are significantly less infiltrated with leukocytes than primary colorectal tumors, allowing direct analysis of integrin ?2 on tumor cells by immunohistochemical staining. Sections of concurrent liver and lung metastases available from seven colorectal cancer patients were stained with anti–integrin ?2 antibody and processes for immunohistochemistry as described. The staining patterns are summarized as in Supporting Table S1 . In six of seven cases, the liver metastases had higher levels of staining than the pulmonary metastases ( P = 0.0075). In roughly half the cases, hepatic metastases showed extremely strong staining for integrin ?2, whereas the corresponding lung metastases had extremely low staining ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). These results in both primary and metastatic human colorectal cancers show a correlation between integrin ?2 expression and propensity to metastasize to the liver.  Results <italic>In vivo</italic> selection of liver metastasizing subline of B16 melanoma B16-F0 melanoma cells were subjected to eight rounds of in vivo selection for liver metastasis using an intrasplenic injection route ( Fig. 1A ). Intrasplenic injection of B16-F0 generates very few hepatic metastases; instead demonstrating massive peritoneal dissemination ( Fig. 1B–D ). A rare liver metastasis was explanted and expanded in vitro followed by intrasplenic readministration ( Fig. 1A ). After four (B16-KY4) and eight rounds of selection (B16-KY8), tumor lines were established. B6 mice were challenged with four different tumor lines (B16-F0, B16-KY4, B16-KY8, and B16-F10, a subline selected for lung metastatic potential) in the hepatic metastasis model. At the time of death, mice were necropsied and inspected for patterns of metastasis. Mice challenged with B16-F0 and B16-F10 had marked peritoneal dissemination of their disease and relatively small disease burden in the liver. In striking contrast, mice challenged with B16-KY8 had significant disease burden in the liver with little peritoneal dissemination. Mice challenged with B16-KY4 had an intermediate pattern of metastasis ( Fig. 1B ). To better quantify hepatic metastases, B6 mice challenged with the B16-F0, B16-F10 B16-KY4, and B16-KY8 lines were necropsied on day 17 after intrasplenic injection, and livers were inspected and weighed ( Fig. 1C and D ). The B16-KY8 challenged mice had significantly higher liver weights and hepatic disease burden compared with the other groups ( P < 0.02). In addition to having more disease in the liver, the peritoneal cavity of the mice challenged with B16-KY8 cells had much less extrahepatic dissemination. B16-F0, B16-F10 B16-KY4, and B16-KY8 cell lines were found to have similar growth rates as assessed by cell doubling time ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), and this cannot be the cause of increased tumor volume in the liver. Assessment of cell surface molecule expression associated with liver metastasis The four B16 cell lines were analyzed by flow cytometry to survey a broad panel of adhesion molecules. We concentrated on molecules related to cell attachment, and previously studied molecules described as important in the metastatic process. Of over 30 membrane molecules analyzed quantitatively for surface expression, including chemokine receptors previously implicated in hepatic homing, only integrin ?2 (also known as CD49b) was differentially expressed on B16-KY8 cells relative to the other three B16 cell lines ( Supplementary Fig. S2A–D ). Because integrin ?2 combines in a heterodimeric complex with integrin ?1 (also known as CD29) to form VLA2, we also performed flow cytometric assays to test differences in expression of integrin ?1. The four B16 cell lines expressed similar amounts of integrin ?1 but only the B16-KY8 cell line expressed higher amounts of integrin ?2 ( Fig. 2A ). B16-KY8 cells were sorted into two populations: integrin ?2 high and low expressing cells. Mice were challenged with these cells using the intrasplenic injection model and then sacrificed on day 21. When the high integrin ?2 cells were used, 30% of mice had limited peritoneal disease. In contrast, 100% of mice receiving intrasplenic injection of the low integrin ?2 cells developed peritoneal dissemination. Although 100% of mice in both groups developed hepatic metastases, the number of nodules in the liver was significantly higher in the group with the high integrin ?2 tumor cells challenge compared with the group challenged with the low integrin ?2 B16-KY8 cells ( Fig. 2B ). At the same time, the number of peritoneal nodules in the high integrin ?2–injected mice was much less than the number in the low integrin ?2 (high, 0.7 ± 0.5; low, 31.1 ± 6.4; Fig. 2B ). When the high integrin ?2 cells were used to challenge mice via tail vein injection, a route that allows for initial passage of tumor cells through the lungs, 27% of the mice developed liver metastasis and all 100% developed lung metastases. When the low integrin ?2 cells were used to challenge mice via tail vein injection, 100% developed lung metastases but none developed liver metastases (data not shown). The number of lung metastases did not significantly differ between the two groups (data not shown). These results provided evidence that integrin ?2 expression might indeed enhance formation of liver metastasis. Integrin ?2 blockade inhibits hepatic metastasis, whereas ?2 integrin overexpression promotes selective hepatic metastasis Blocking B16-KY8 cells with anti–integrin ?2 antibody in the hepatic metastasis model was studied. Although treatment of B16-KY8 cells by blocking with anti–integrin ?2 antibody did not completely eliminate hepatic metastasis, it significantly reduced the number relative to treatment with the isotype control antibody (isotype, 27 ± 6; blocked, 18 ± 6; P = 0.013; data not shown). Importantly, anti–integrin ?2 antibody treatment concomitantly increased peritoneal dissemination of B16-KY8 (isotype, 2 ± 3; blocked, 24 ± 17; Fig. 3A ), demonstrating that integrin ?2 blockade did not reduce generic metastatic potential but rather shifted metastasis away from the liver. To further show that integrin ?2 can promote selective hepatic metastasis, we transfected B16-F0 with the integrin ?2 gene to generate the B16-SKY line expressing high levels of integrin ?2 and the B16-SKYP line expressing similar levels of integrin ?2 to B16-KY8 ( Fig. 3A ). We first used B16-SKY to challenge mice by both intrasplenic and i.v. routes. After intrasplenic injection, B16-SKY produced significantly more hepatic metastastic nodules than B16-F0 (although not as many as B16-KY8; B16-F0 versus B16-KY8, P = 0.0006; B16-F0 versus B16-SKY, P = 0.0023; Fig. 3A ). We also studied the effect of blocking integrin ?2 expression on B16-SKY on the pattern of metastases after intrasplenic and tail vein injection. The most notable effect of blocking integrin ?2 expression on B16-SKY in the hepatic metastasis model was to increase the rate of peritoneal metastases (the number of nodules: B16-SKY with isotype antibody, 5.1 ± 9.8; B16-SKY blocked, 17.8 ± 6.1; P = 0.0011), although there was additionally a decrease in liver metastases (the number of nodules: B16-SKY with isotype antibody, 11.6 ± 1.1; B16-SKY blocked, 7.1 ± 1.3; P = 0.02; Fig. 3A ). Blocking integrin ?2 expression on B16-SKY decreased the rate of hepatic metastases and increased the rate of peritoneal metastases after i.v. injection ( Fig. 3B ). There was no difference in the number of pulmonary metastases, further supporting the notion that enhancement of metastatic potential by integrin ?2 expression is selective for the liver. To determine whether physiologic levels of integrin ?2 mediate selective liver metastasis, we injected B16-SKY and B16-SKYP with or without blockade of integrin ?2 via hemispleen, we then counted the number of nodules in the liver on day 17 after injection. The number of nodules in B16-SKYP was similar to those in B16-SKY (B16-SKYP, 12.3 ± 1.8; B16-SKY, 11.6 ± 1.1; not statistically significant). This tropism was abrogated with blockade of integrin ?2 expression (100% blockade of integrin ?2 expression at the time of tumor injection; B16-SKYP blocked, 5.2 ± 1.6; B16-SKY blocked, 7.1 ± 1.3; B16-SKY versus B16-SKY blocked, P = 0.02; B16-SKYP versus B16-SKYP blocked, P = 0.008; Fig. 3C ). In previous studies to develop the intrasplenic injection model of hepatic metastases, we used a BALB/c-derived colon cancer, CT26, which, unlike B16-F0 or B16-F10, shows a high degree of liver metastasis and little peritoneal dissemination. CT26 was found to naturally express integrin ?2, and we therefore studied whether antibody blockade of integrin ?2 altered the metastatic pattern. Indeed, treatment of CT26 with anti–integrin ?2 antibody before injection altered the metastatic pattern, diminishing liver metastasis (CT26 isotype control, 12.5 ± 2.4; CT26 blocked, 3.8 ± 1.5; P = 0.009) and increasing peritoneal dissemination (CT26 isotype control, 3.2 ± 1.9; CT26 blocked, 11.7 ± 2.4; P = 0.014; Fig. 4A and B ). To evaluate additional tumors naturally expressing integrin ?2, we tested an integrin ?2 expression breast cancer, 4T-1 in the hemispleen model. 4T-1 efficiently generates liver metastases, and treatment with anti–integrin ?2 antibody before injection showed the same findings as CT26 and B16-KY8 (4T-1 isotype control, 60.4 ± 11.8; 4T-1 blocked, 13.2 ± 9.4; P = 0.03; Fig. 4C ). These results strengthen the notion that enhancement of hepatic metastasis by integrin ?2 is not a phenomenon specific to the B16 tumor. Integrin ?2 expression enhances binding to collagen type IV Integrins ?2 mediates collagen binding, and the liver is particularly rich in type IV collagen. We therefore asked whether integrin ?2 up-regulation might enhance collagen type IV binding. An attachment assay to collagen type IV–coated plates was per formed using B16-F0 and B16-KY8. The counting was performed in a “blinded” fashion. The B16-F0 group displayed low numbers of attached tumor cells on the collagen type IV–coated plate (138 ± 17). In contrast, the B16-KY8 group displayed a >6-fold increase in attachment (881 ± 95, P < 0.001; 8 per group; Fig. 5A and B ). When either B16-KY8 or B16-SKYP was first treated with anti– integrin ?2 blocking antibody, attachment to collagen type IV–coated plates was significantly inhibited [B16-KY8, 786 ± 30; B16-KY8 blocked, 163 ± 42; P < 0.0001; B16-SKYP, 829 ± 28; B16-SKYP blocked, 142 ± 39; P < 0.0001; 8 high power field (HPF) per group; Fig. 5C ]. Additionally, both B16-SKYP and B16-KY8 cells had high affinity for collagen type IV (B16-F0, 102 ± 12; B16-KY8, 367 ± 53; B16-SKYP, 502 ± 178; both B16-F0 versus B16-KY8 and B16-F0 versus B16-SKYP, P < 0.003; 4 HPF per group). These cells were also incubated on collagen type I/III or fibronectin-coated plates; there was very little attachment and no enhancement by integrin ?2 expression. Integrin ?2 expression correlated with a slight increase in attachment to laminin-coated plates. (uncoated: B16-F0, 7 ± 2; B16-KY8, 10 ± 2; B16-SKYP, 3 ± 1; Laminin: B16-F0, 47 ± 1; B16-KY8, 81 ± 7; B16-SKYP, 114 ± 8; both B16-F0 versus B16-KY8 and B16-F0 versus B16-SKYP, P < 0.003; collagen type I/III: B16-F0, 2 ± 1; B16-KY8, 4 ± 1; B16-SKYP, 3 ± 1; Fibronectin: B16-F0, 2 ± 1; B16-KY8, 19 ± 7; B16-SKYP, 6 ± 1; 4 HPF per group; Fig. 5C ). Integrin ?2 enhances collagen type IV–dependent FAK activation FAK plays a major role in cell motility and has been shown to be activated by engagement of a number of integrins, including integrin ?2, and is thought to be an important factor in the metastatic process. Indeed, attachment of B16-KY8 and B16-SKY to collagen type IV–coated plates resulted in significant FAK activation (as measured by tyrosine phosphorylation at Y397), peaking at 90 min, whereas B16-F0 cells plated on collagen IV failed to activate FAK ( Fig. 6A ). FAK activation was collagen type IV dependent ( Fig. 6A and B ) and specific, because another kinase involved in metabolic regulation of tumor cells, AKT, was equally activated in B16-F0, KY8, or SKY and was not affected by binding to collagen IV (data not shown). This study shows that induction of integrin ?2 results in collagen type IV–dependent FAK activation and provides a potential mechanistic basis for its role in mediating selective hepatic metastasis. Correlation between integrin ?2 expression and hepatic metastasis in human colorectal cancer We also analyzed colorectal tumors from patients with simultaneous liver and lung metastases. Metastases are significantly less infiltrated with leukocytes than primary colorectal tumors, allowing direct analysis of integrin ?2 on tumor cells by immunohistochemical staining. Sections of concurrent liver and lung metastases available from seven colorectal cancer patients were stained with anti–integrin ?2 antibody and processes for immunohistochemistry as described. The staining patterns are summarized as in Supporting Table S1 . In six of seven cases, the liver metastases had higher levels of staining than the pulmonary metastases ( P = 0.0075). In roughly half the cases, hepatic metastases showed extremely strong staining for integrin ?2, whereas the corresponding lung metastases had extremely low staining ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). These results in both primary and metastatic human colorectal cancers show a correlation between integrin ?2 expression and propensity to metastasize to the liver.  <italic>In vivo</italic> selection of liver metastasizing subline of B16 melanoma B16-F0 melanoma cells were subjected to eight rounds of in vivo selection for liver metastasis using an intrasplenic injection route ( Fig. 1A ). Intrasplenic injection of B16-F0 generates very few hepatic metastases; instead demonstrating massive peritoneal dissemination ( Fig. 1B–D ). A rare liver metastasis was explanted and expanded in vitro followed by intrasplenic readministration ( Fig. 1A ). After four (B16-KY4) and eight rounds of selection (B16-KY8), tumor lines were established. B6 mice were challenged with four different tumor lines (B16-F0, B16-KY4, B16-KY8, and B16-F10, a subline selected for lung metastatic potential) in the hepatic metastasis model. At the time of death, mice were necropsied and inspected for patterns of metastasis. Mice challenged with B16-F0 and B16-F10 had marked peritoneal dissemination of their disease and relatively small disease burden in the liver. In striking contrast, mice challenged with B16-KY8 had significant disease burden in the liver with little peritoneal dissemination. Mice challenged with B16-KY4 had an intermediate pattern of metastasis ( Fig. 1B ). To better quantify hepatic metastases, B6 mice challenged with the B16-F0, B16-F10 B16-KY4, and B16-KY8 lines were necropsied on day 17 after intrasplenic injection, and livers were inspected and weighed ( Fig. 1C and D ). The B16-KY8 challenged mice had significantly higher liver weights and hepatic disease burden compared with the other groups ( P < 0.02). In addition to having more disease in the liver, the peritoneal cavity of the mice challenged with B16-KY8 cells had much less extrahepatic dissemination. B16-F0, B16-F10 B16-KY4, and B16-KY8 cell lines were found to have similar growth rates as assessed by cell doubling time ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), and this cannot be the cause of increased tumor volume in the liver.  <italic>In vivo</italic> selection of liver metastasizing subline of B16 melanoma B16-F0 melanoma cells were subjected to eight rounds of in vivo selection for liver metastasis using an intrasplenic injection route ( Fig. 1A ).

Integrin ?2 blockade inhibits hepatic metastasis, whereas ?2 integrin overexpression promotes selective hepatic metastasis Blocking B16-KY8 cells with anti–integrin ?2 antibody in the hepatic metastasis model was studied. Although treatment of B16-KY8 cells by blocking with anti–integrin ?2 antibody did not completely eliminate hepatic metastasis, it significantly reduced the number relative to treatment with the isotype control antibody (isotype, 27 ± 6; blocked, 18 ± 6; P = 0.013; data not shown).

When either B16-KY8 or B16-SKYP was first treated with anti– integrin ?2 blocking antibody, attachment to collagen type IV–coated plates was significantly inhibited [B16-KY8, 786 ± 30; B16-KY8 blocked, 163 ± 42; P < 0.0001; B16-SKYP, 829 ± 28; B16-SKYP blocked, 142 ± 39; P < 0.0001; 8 high power field (HPF) per group; Fig. 5C ]. Additionally, both B16-SKYP and B16-KY8 cells had high affinity for collagen type IV (B16-F0, 102 ± 12; B16-KY8, 367 ± 53; B16-SKYP, 502 ± 178; both B16-F0 versus B16-KY8 and B16-F0 versus B16-SKYP, P < 0.003; 4 HPF per group). These cells were also incubated on collagen type I/III or fibronectin-coated plates; there was very little attachment and no enhancement by integrin ?2 expression. Integrin ?2 expression correlated with a slight increase in attachment to laminin-coated plates. (uncoated: B16-F0, 7 ± 2; B16-KY8, 10 ± 2; B16-SKYP, 3 ± 1; Laminin: B16-F0, 47 ± 1; B16-KY8, 81 ± 7; B16-SKYP, 114 ± 8; both B16-F0 versus B16-KY8 and B16-F0 versus B16-SKYP, P < 0.003; collagen type I/III: B16-F0, 2 ± 1; B16-KY8, 4 ± 1; B16-SKYP, 3 ± 1; Fibronectin: B16-F0, 2 ± 1; B16-KY8, 19 ± 7; B16-SKYP, 6 ± 1; 4 HPF per group; Fig. 5C ).  Integrin ?2 expression enhances binding to collagen type IV Integrins ?2 mediates collagen binding, and the liver is particularly rich in type IV collagen. We therefore asked whether integrin ?2 up-regulation might enhance collagen type IV binding. An attachment assay to collagen type IV–coated plates was per formed using B16-F0 and B16-KY8. The counting was performed in a “blinded” fashion. The B16-F0 group displayed low numbers of attached tumor cells on the collagen type IV–coated plate (138 ± 17). In contrast, the B16-KY8 group displayed a >6-fold increase in attachment (881 ± 95, P < 0.001; 8 per group; Fig. 5A and B ).

Integrin ?2 enhances collagen type IV–dependent FAK activation FAK plays a major role in cell motility and has been shown to be activated by engagement of a number of integrins, including integrin ?2, and is thought to be an important factor in the metastatic process. Indeed, attachment of B16-KY8 and B16-SKY to collagen type IV–coated plates resulted in significant FAK activation (as measured by tyrosine phosphorylation at Y397), peaking at 90 min, whereas B16-F0 cells plated on collagen IV failed to activate FAK ( Fig. 6A ). FAK activation was collagen type IV dependent ( Fig. 6A and B ) and specific, because another kinase involved in metabolic regulation of tumor cells, AKT, was equally activated in B16-F0, KY8, or SKY and was not affected by binding to collagen IV (data not shown). This study shows that induction of integrin ?2 results in collagen type IV–dependent FAK activation and provides a potential mechanistic basis for its role in mediating selective hepatic metastasis.

Correlation between integrin ?2 expression and hepatic metastasis in human colorectal cancer We also analyzed colorectal tumors from patients with simultaneous liver and lung metastases. Metastases are significantly less infiltrated with leukocytes than primary colorectal tumors, allowing direct analysis of integrin ?2 on tumor cells by immunohistochemical staining. Sections of concurrent liver and lung metastases available from seven colorectal cancer patients were stained with anti–integrin ?2 antibody and processes for immunohistochemistry as described. The staining patterns are summarized as in Supporting Table S1 . In six of seven cases, the liver metastases had higher levels of staining than the pulmonary metastases ( P = 0.0075). In roughly half the cases, hepatic metastases showed extremely strong staining for integrin ?2, whereas the corresponding lung metastases had extremely low staining ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). These results in both primary and metastatic human colorectal cancers show a correlation between integrin ?2 expression and propensity to metastasize to the liver.

Discussion The formation of metastatic disease from a tumor primary requires multiple complex processes that have been associated with the up-regulation of various cell surface molecules, and in particular integrins ( 18 , 19 ). We hypothesized that differential expression of one or more cell surface molecules would be responsible for differences in metastatic pattern. Remarkably, analysis of a broad panel of integrins, chemokine receptors, and cellular adhesion molecules revealed a single molecule, integrin ?2, which was differentially expressed between the nonliver metastasizing parental B16-F0 tumor and the liver metastasizing B16-KY8. We used multiple complimentary approaches to show that integrin ?2 plays a causal role in liver metastasis. Additionally, two other cell lines that express integrin ?2 showed liver-metastasizing capacity that was blocked by anti–integrin ?2 antibodies. In vitro studies suggested that integrin ?2 may facilitate hepatic metastasis via binding to collagen type IV and consequent activation of FAK. We also studied integrin ?2 expression in patient samples. We studied matched hepatic and pulmonary metastases from patients with colorectal cancer. In two cases, we also had the matched primary specimens. We found increased cell surface expression of the integrin ?2 protein on tumor cells in hepatic metastases compared with pulmonary metastases. This finding is compatible with a report that uveal melanomas, which preferentially metastasize to the liver, show increases in expression of integrin ?2 ( 20 ). Integrin ?2 ?1 also known as very late antigen 2 (VLA2) is primarily found on activated T cells, platelets, and have been described on epithelial cells such as keratinocytes ( 21 ). Interestingly on keratinoyctes, VLA2 is considered a differentiation marker. Upon terminal differentiation, keratinocytes not only lose their contact to the basement membrane, but also decrease their expression of VLA2 drastically ( 22 ). The expression of the other two collagen-binding integrins, ?10 ?1 and ?11 ?1, is more restricted to chondrocytes and fibroblasts, respectively ( 23 , 24 ). Integrin ?2 ?1 can bind with collagen type I, II, and IV ( 25 , 26 ). Collagen type I is found primarily in bone, dermis, tendon, ligaments, and cornea ( 27 ). Collagen type II is found primarily in cartilage, vitreous body, and nucleus pulposus ( 27 ). Collagen type IV is found primarily in basement membrane ( 27 ). In our murine models of hepatic, pulmonary, and peritoneal metastases, collagen type IV, which is highly enriched in the liver, is the most relevant collagen subtype to implicate in an integrin-collagen interaction. Although a number of studies have implicated integrin expression in the metastatic process, including liver metastases, the findings presented here are the first to directly show a role for integrin ?2 in selective liver metastasis. A few reports have implicated ?6 integrin (associated with various ? subunits), which binds laminin, in liver metastases ( 27 – 30 ). The most convincing report showed that both components of a complex of integrin ?6 ?4 and the D6.1A tetraspanin were necessary for liver metastasis in a rat pancreatic adenocarcinoma model ( 31 ). Other adhesion molecules, including integrin ?v ?3, osteopontin (a ligand for integrin ?v ?3), integrin ?v ?5, integrin ?4 ?1, and VCAM-1, have been associated with liver metastasis in various models ( 32 – 36 ), but their direct role has not been comprehensively confirmed by blockade and overexpression analyses, nor comparative expression analysis in human tumors as we have done for integrin ?2 in the current report. In contrast to our findings, Haier and colleagues ( 37 ) reported similar levels of integrin ?2 expression by poorly versus highly liver-metastasizing sublines of human colon tumor line, as well as lower collagen IV binding and higher collagen I binding by the highly liver-metastasizing line. The basis for these differences is unclear, although we note that no quantitative analysis [e.g., by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)] of integrin ?2 cell surface expression was performed. It is possible that the xenogeneic nature of their system (human tumor cells injected into mice) obscured a role for species-specific interactions. Alternatively, it is possible that other molecular interactions besides integrin ?2–collagen type IV mediate liver metastases in their xenogeneic system. Indeed, the fact that in vivo selected B16-KY8 shows somewhat greater liver-metastasizing efficiency than the integrin ?2 transfectant, B16-SKYP, despite comparable levels of integrin ?2 expression, indicates that multiple pathways contribute to this process. Although this is the first report to implicate integrin ?2 in hepatic metastasis, two earlier studies have shown that integrin ?2 plays a role in the intrahepatic migration of tumor cells. One report showed that chemotactic and haptotactic migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in response to growth factors produced in a fibrotic microenvironment involves integrin ?2 ( 38 ). A second report showed that although integrin ?2 did not affect extravasation of rhabdomyosarcoma cells in the liver, it facilitated their intrahepatic migration to the subcapsular space once in the liver parenchyma ( 39 ). It remains to be determined whether ?2 integrin–mediated adhesion to collagen type IV with subsequent FAK activation associated with hepatic metastasis in the current report directly enhances intrahepatic migration of tumor cells. The link between integrins and intracellular signaling molecules involved in cell migration, such as FAK, is an emerging theme in metastasis research ( 40 ). Of note, FAK activation has been linked to multiple cell activities, such as tissue invasion, matrix assembly, cell mobility, and cell fate ( 41 ). Whether FAK signaling always enhances liver metastasis is unclear because it has been found to be up-regulated in metastases in other organs ( 12 , 13 ). However, in our animal model and in human colorectal cancer, the first major capillary and tissue bed encountered by potentially metastatic cells from either splenic injection or from a colorectal primary is the liver. Additionally, it may be the combination of the extracellular adhesion interactions between integrin ?2 ?1 and collagen type IV in combination with the intracellular signaling through FAK that enhances liver metastases. In summary, we have provided direct evidence in murine models and correlative evidence in human tumors that integrin ?2 ?1 is one of the determinants conferring potential for selective hepatic metastasis.
