Neuropeptides, Mesenteric Fat, and Intestinal Inflammation The ability of fat tissue cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines and the concept that obesity represents a low-grade inflammatory response have been well documented during the past decade. The effects of fat-mediated inflammation on metabolic pathologies have also been drawing increasing interest, However, very little is known on the potential effects of adipose tissue in the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal diseases with an inflammatory component, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The development of large fat masses around the inflamed intestine during Crohn’s disease makes this tissue a candidate for more intense investigation in studies aiming to gain insights in the pathogenesis and progress of the disease. Furthermore, neuropeptides act in many cases in a proinflammatory manner and are shown to participate in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation in animal models of IBD However, the potential of these molecules to interact with fat cells in the context of IBD has not been investigated. In this review we describe our most recent data related to the effects of neuropeptides on non-inflammatory fat tissue components. In addition, we include discussion to associate neuropeptide-induced, adipose tissue-mediated responses with the generation of intestinal inflammatory conditions such as Crohn’s disease.
