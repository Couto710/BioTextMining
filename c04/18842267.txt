Quantification of the mechanical behavior of carotid arteries from wild-type, dystrophin-deficient, and sarcoglycan-? knockout mice As patients with muscular dystrophy live longer because of improved clinical care, they will become increasingly susceptible to many of the cardiovascular diseases that affect the general population. There is, therefore, a pressing need to better understand both the biology and the mechanics of the arterial wall in these patients. In this paper, we use nonlinear constitutive relations to model, for the first time, the biaxial mechanical behavior of carotid arteries from two common mouse models of muscular dystrophy (dystrophin deficient and sarcoglycan-delta null) and wild-type controls. It is shown that a structurally motivated four-fiber family stress-strain relation describes the passive behavior of all three genotypes better than does a commonly used phenomenological exponential model, and that a Rachev-Hayashi model describes the mechanical contribution of smooth muscle contraction under basal tone. Because structurally motivated constitutive relations can be extended easily to model adaptations to altered hemodynamics, results from this study represent an important step toward the ultimate goal of understanding better the mechanobiology and pathophysiology of arteries in muscular dystrophy.  Introduction The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) is a transmembrane molecular bridge that links cytoskeletal F-actin with the extracellular matrix protein laminin-2 and localizes many signaling proteins within muscle cells, including vascular smooth muscle. Genetic defects that compromise the DGC have been implicated in muscular dystrophies - progressive muscle disorders characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and wasting that affect approximately 250,000 people in the United States alone. Whereas defects of the DGC are well studied in skeletal muscle, less is known about the role of this complex in vascular smooth muscle. Because the DGC likely plays key roles in mediating mechano-sensitive biological responses, its potential importance in the control of vascular wall biology and mechanics warrants additional study. Previously, we compared biaxial biomechanical and vasoreactive functional responses of common carotid arteries from wild-type, dystrophin-deficient (mdx), and sarcoglycan-? null (sgcd?/?) mice ( Dye et al., 2007 ). In this paper, we report constitutive relations and best-fit values of material parameters that describe these previously reported data under both basal smooth muscle tone (basal) and maximally-dilated (passive) conditions. Specifically, using a two-dimensional (2-D) theoretical framework, we evaluated a phenomenological model proposed by Chuong and Fung (1986) and a structurally motivated four-fiber family model proposed by Baek et al. (2007) as possible descriptors of the passive biomechanical responses, and we evaluated the model proposed by Rachev and Hayashi (1999) for active smooth muscle. We found that the four-fiber family model (with 8 parameters) provided a better fit to the passive mechanical data from each genotype than did the Chuong and Fung model (with 7 parameters) and that it also provided quantitative interpretations that were more consistent with the prior experimental findings. In addition, the model of Rachev and Hayashi provided a reasonable description of the mechanical contribution of basal smooth muscle tone for each genotype. Having structurally motivated constitutive relations for the biomechanical behavior of carotid arteries from wild-type and muscular dystrophy mouse models is an important first step toward modeling adaptive processes that are important to clinical care.  Methods Theoretical Framework Mouse carotid arteries are long, straight, nearly cylindrical vessels with few or no branches, which facilitates both in vitro experimentation and constitutive formulations. We modeled these arteries using a 2-D framework and thus considered mean values for the intramural stresses. Reasons for this were twofold. First, residual stresses in arteries tend to homogenize the transmural distribution of stress under physiologic conditions, thereby rendering mean values of stress as good estimates of transmural values. Second, murine carotid arteries have a deformed thickness-to-radius ratio of ~0.07 and consist of only two-to-three layers of smooth muscle cells (cf. ~40 layers for human carotid arteries). In a 2-D setting, it is assumed that ? rr ? ? ?? and ? rr ? ? zz , where ? rr , ? ?? , and ? zz are mean values of the radial, circumferential, and axial components of Cauchy stress. Mean values for ? ?? , and ? zz can be calculated directly from experimental data as (1) ? ? ? = P a h and ? z z = f ? h ( 2 a + h ) , where P is the transmural pressure, a and h are the luminal radius and wall thickness in a loaded configuration, and f = f T + ?a 2 P is the total axial force applied to the vessel; f T is the force measured via an in-line transducer and ?a 2 P accounts for the end-cap force that arises during in vitro testing. Because of the assumption that ? rr ?0, appropriate nonlinear constitutive relations for mean values of ? ?? , and ? zz are (2) ? ? ? = ? ? 2 ? W ? E ? ? ? ? r 2 ? W ? E R R + ? ? ? act and ? z z = ? z 2 ? W ? E Z Z ? ? r 2 ? W ? E R R , where ? i are mean in-plane stretch ratios ( i = r , ? , z ), E AA are mean principal components of the Green strain ( A = R , ? , Z ; no sum), which is defined in the reference configuration, W is the strain-energy function for passive behavior, and ? ? ? act describes the active contractile response of smooth muscle. Combining equations (1) and (2) , we obtain relations suitable for parameter estimation, namely (3) P = h a [ ? ? 2 ? W ? E ? ? ? ? r 2 ? W ? E R R + ? ? ? act ] , and (4) f T = ? h ( 2 a + h ) [ ? z 2 ? W ? E Z Z ? ? r 2 ? W ? E R R ] ? ? a 2 P , which relate the measurable applied loads on the left-hand side of each equation with geometric changes and the constitutive model on the right hand side. Constitutive Relations Consider two candidate strain-energy functions W for the passive behavior: one proposed by Chuong and Fung (1986) and a four-fiber family model proposed by Baek et al. (2007) , which is a straightforward extension of the two-fiber family model of Holzapfel et al. (2000) . The model of Chuong and Fung is (5) W = c 2 ( e Q ? 1 ) where Q = c 1 E ? ? 2 + c 2 E Z Z 2 + c 3 E R R 2 + 2 c 4 E ? ? E Z Z + 2 c 5 E Z Z E R R + 2 c 6 E R R E ? ? and c and c 1–6 are material parameters. The four-fiber family model is (6) W = b 1 2 ( I 1 ? 3 ) + ? k = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 b 2 k 4 b 3 k { exp [ b 3 k ( ( ? k ) 2 ? 1 ) 2 ] ? 1 } where b 1, b 2 k , and b 3 k are material parameters, with k denoting a fiber family, I 1 = tr ( C ) = C RR + C ?? + C ZZ is the first invariant of the right Cauchy-Green strain tensor C , where principal components of C are related to those of E via C AA = 2 E AA ? 1, ? k = M k · C M k is the stretch of the k th fiber family, M k = sin ( ? o k ) e ? + cos ( ? o k ) e z is the unit vector along the k th fiber direction in the reference configuration, and ? o k is the associated angle between the axial and fiber directions. In general, ( ? k ) 2 = C ? ? sin 2 ( ? o k ) + 2 C ? Z sin ( ? o k ) cos ( ? o k ) + C Z Z cos 2 ( ? o k ) , but C ?Z = 0 for inflation and extension tests. We considered four fiber families with ? o 1 = 0 ° (axial), ? o 2 = 90 ° (circumferential), and ? o 3 = ? ? o 4 = ? o (diagonal), which was left as a variable to be determined along with seven material parameters (with b 2 3 = b 2 4 and b 3 3 = b 3 4 for the diagonal fibers). In addition, consider one model for the active (contractile) response of the smooth muscle cells under basal tone. Following Rachev and Hayashi (1999) , we let (7) ? ? act = T act ? ? 2 [ 1 ? ( ? M ? ? ? ? M ? ? 0 ) 2 ] where ? M is the stretch at which the contraction is maximum, ? 0 is the stretch at which active force generation ceases, and T act is a parameter associated with the degree of muscle activation, which may be correlated with the intracellular calcium concentration. Parameter estimation Biaxial data came from Dye et al. (2007) for both passive and basal-tone conditions. Briefly, these data resulted from cyclic inflation tests performed at three fixed axial stretches ( ? z = 1.65, 1.80, and 1.95) and cyclic extension tests performed at three fixed transmural pressures ( P = 60, 100, 140 mmHg). P , f T , outer diameter d , and loaded length l were monitored continuously over two to three cycles for each protocol. Also measured directly were the unloaded outer diameter D and unloaded axial length L . In addition, wall thickness was measured at multiple static configurations and a mean value for vessel volume V? was used to calculate the luminal radius a = b 2 ? V ¯ / ( ? ? ) and thickness h = ( b ? a ) during cyclic testing; here b is the loaded outer radius. Mean circumferential stretch was calculated as ? ? = r mid / R mid , where mid-wall radii r mid = ( a + b )/2 and R mid = ( A + B ) 2, with A and B the unloaded inner and outer radii, and axial stretch was calculated as ? z = l / L . Best-fit values of material parameters for the passive Chuong and Fung model ( c and c 1–6) and the four-fiber family model ( b 1, b 2 k , b 3 k , and ? 0, where k = 1, 2, and 3 = 4) were determined via a multi-dimensional nonlinear regression, using the Nelder-Mead direct search method, that minimized the error e between measured values of P and f T on the left-hand side of equations (3) and (4) and calculated values on the right-hand side of equations (3) and (4) , given measured values of ? ? and ? z . Namely, we minimized the error function (8) e = ? n ( P meas ? P model ) 2 ? n ( P meas ) 2 + ? n ( f meas ? f model ) 2 ? n ( f meas ) 2 using the fminsearch subroutine in MatLab 6.1. Data were taken between 0 and 160 mmHg at increments of 2 mmHg for the P ? d tests and from the stretch at zero axial force to ? z = 1.95 for the f ? l tests; taken together, the three P ? d tests and three f ? l tests yielded n = 325 to 350 data points. A penalty method was employed to ensure non-negative values of all best-fit parameters. Data collected at basal smooth muscle tone over these same loading scenarios were used to determine the additional parameters for the active contractile response ( ? M , ? o , and T act ). For these estimations, parameters for the four-fiber family model determined from passive data were used to calculate the passive contribution to stress in equations (3) and (4) . The error function ( 8 ) was again minimized via nonlinear regression for experimental values during P ? d and f ? l tests for vessels having a basal smooth muscle tone.

Because of the assumption that ? rr ?0, appropriate nonlinear constitutive relations for mean values of ? ?? , and ? zz are (2) ? ? ? = ? ? 2 ? W ? E ? ? ? ? r 2 ? W ? E R R + ? ? ? act and ? z z = ? z 2 ? W ? E Z Z ? ? r 2 ? W ? E R R , where ? i are mean in-plane stretch ratios ( i = r , ? , z ), E AA are mean principal components of the Green strain ( A = R , ? , Z ; no sum), which is defined in the reference configuration, W is the strain-energy function for passive behavior, and ? ? ? act describes the active contractile response of smooth muscle. Combining equations (1) and (2) , we obtain relations suitable for parameter estimation, namely (3) P = h a [ ? ? 2 ? W ? E ? ? ? ? r 2 ? W ? E R R + ? ? ? act ] , and (4) f T = ? h ( 2 a + h ) [ ? z 2 ? W ? E Z Z ? ? r 2 ? W ?

The model of Chuong and Fung is (5) W = c 2 ( e Q ? 1 ) where Q = c 1 E ? ? 2 + c 2 E Z Z 2 + c 3 E R R 2 + 2 c 4 E ? ? E Z Z + 2 c 5 E Z Z E R R + 2 c 6 E R R E ? ? and c and c 1–6 are material parameters. The four-fiber family model is (6) W = b 1 2 ( I 1 ? 3 ) + ? k = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 b 2 k 4 b 3 k { exp [ b 3 k ( ( ? k ) 2 ? 1 ) 2 ] ? 1 } where b 1, b 2 k , and b 3 k are material parameters, with k denoting a fiber family, I 1 = tr ( C ) = C RR + C ?? + C ZZ is the first invariant of the right Cauchy-Green strain tensor C , where principal components of C are related to those of E via C AA = 2 E AA ? 1, ? k = M k · C M k is the stretch of the k th fiber family, M k = sin ( ? o k ) e ? + cos ( ? o k ) e z is the unit vector along the k th fiber direction in the reference configuration, and ? o k is the associated angle between the axial and fiber directions. In general, ( ? k ) 2 = C ? ? sin 2 ( ? o k ) + 2 C ? Z sin ( ? o k ) cos ( ? o k ) + C Z Z cos 2 ( ? o k ) , but C ?Z = 0 for inflation and extension tests.

In addition, wall thickness was measured at multiple static configurations and a mean value for vessel volume V? was used to calculate the luminal radius a = b 2 ? V ¯ / ( ? ? ) and thickness h = ( b ? a ) during cyclic testing; here b is the loaded outer radius. Mean circumferential stretch was calculated as ? ? = r mid / R mid , where mid-wall radii r mid = ( a + b )/2 and R mid = ( A + B ) 2, with A and B the unloaded inner and outer radii, and axial stretch was calculated as ? z = l / L . Best-fit values of material parameters for the passive Chuong and Fung model ( c and c 1–6) and the four-fiber family model ( b 1, b 2 k , b 3 k , and ? 0, where k = 1, 2, and 3 = 4) were determined via a multi-dimensional nonlinear regression, using the Nelder-Mead direct search method, that minimized the error e between measured values of P and f T on the left-hand side of equations (3) and (4) and calculated values on the right-hand side of equations (3) and (4) , given measured values of ? ? and ? z .

The error function ( 8 ) was again minimized via nonlinear regression for experimental values during P ? d and f ? l tests for vessels having a basal smooth muscle tone.  Results Biomechanical data and modeling results for representative wild-type, mdx, and sgcd?/? carotid arteries illustrate the goodness of fit for the two passive models as well as the active model ( Figure 1 ). Associated best-fit values of the model parameters and minimized error values for each vessel within each genotype ( n = 5 or 6) are provided in Tables 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively. As it can be seen, the four-fiber family model provided a better overall fit to data (i.e., lower value of e ) than did the model of Chuong and Fung for each vessel tested. Notice, too, that fiber directions ? o 3 = ? ? o 4 = ? o , as determined via nonlinear regression, were significantly different in vessels from the mdx (at p = 0.013) and scgd?/? mice (at p = 0.056) compared to vessels from the wild-type mice ( Table 2 and Figure 2 ).

Discussion By linking the cytoskeleton of muscle cells to adjacent extracellular matrix, the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) helps to distribute mechanical stresses on these cells so as to maintain structural integrity during contraction and relaxation ( Petrof et al. 1993 ; Pasternak et al. 1995 ). Absence of DGC components can thus have important implications for arteries, which consist largely of an abundant extracellular matrix with embedded smooth muscle cells that are subjected to continually changing wall shear and intramural (primarily circumferential and axial) stresses. Indeed, an altered biomechanical function of the vasculature in individuals with muscular dystrophy likely contributes to the progression of skeletal muscle weakness and wasting as well as diverse diseases related to diminished blood flow to end organs ( Loufrani et al. 2004 ; Ito et al. 2006 ). Surprisingly few investigators have studied the effects of muscular dystrophies on vascular biology and mechanics. We ( Dye et al. 2007 ) and one group from Paris ( Loufrani et al. 2001 , 2002 , 2004 ) have shown, however, that passive biomechanical behavior and smooth muscle contractility of carotid arteries are not statistically different under normal hemodynamic conditions in male wild-type (C57BL/6J), mdx barrier AX6 (on a C57BL/10SnJ background), and sgcd?/? (on a C57BL/6J background) mice, noting that mdx mice lack the protein dystrophin. It appears, therefore, that carotid arteries compensate, at least in part, during development for the absence of dystrophin or sarcoglycan-delta such that gross responses to normal hemodynamics are not compromised (e.g., mean arterial pressure and pressure-diameter responses are the same in mdx and wild-type controls). Nevertheless, Loufrani et al. (2001) found that “absence of dystrophin was associated with a defect in signal transduction of [flow-induced wall] shear stress.” That is, overall responses to the exogenous vasodilators acetylcholine (endothelial-dependent) and sodium nitroprusside (endothelial-independent) were normal, but dilation in response to increased shear stress was only 50–60% of normal in mdx mice. Whereas these experiments were performed acutely in isolated perfused vessels, the general importance of shear-regulated remodeling in vivo in response to sustained alterations in flow (e.g., Rudic et al., 2000 ; Schiffers et al., 2000 ; Sullivan and Hoying, 2002 ) suggests that a compromised shear-regulated dilatory function would adversely affect chronic adaptations (i.e., arterial growth and remodeling) to increased flow (as in exercise regimes, which are important but difficult to optimize for muscular dystrophy patients). Indeed, similar compromised adaptations to increased pressure (e.g., as in exercise or hypertension) should be expected, particularly given the important coupling of flow- and pressure-induced growth and remodeling in arteries ( Ueno et al., 2000 ; Dajnowiec and Langille, 2007 ). Gleason et al. (2004) and Gleason and Humphrey (2004) recently proposed models of arterial growth and remodeling in special cases of sustained alterations of flow and pressure. Such models promise to increase our understanding of adaptive processes and ultimately to aid in the design of improved clinical interventions ( Humphrey and Taylor, 2008 ). Essential to models of growth and remodeling, however, is knowledge of the constitutive behavior of individual constituents. Although it is not possible, at present, to infer separately the mechanical properties of elastin, fibrillar collagen, and smooth muscle (the primary contributors to wall mechanics) from traditional inflation-extension tests, combining a structurally motivated constitutive model for passive behavior with a model for active smooth muscle enables one to approximate such properties. For example, in contrast to the phenomenological model of Chuong and Fung, the four-fiber family model enables one to estimate contributions due to the elastin-dominated amorphous matrix (isotropic term in equation 6 ) and contributions due to multiple families of fibrillar collagen (anisotropic terms in equation 6 ). Indeed, Wicker et al. (2008) show that this four-fiber family model captures mean collagen fiber angles in basilar arteries (measured independently using nonlinear optical microscopy), and comparison of the present best-fit values for b 1 (on the order of 101) with those of Wicker and colleagues (on the order of 10?7) showed that the four-fiber family model captured the greater contribution of elastin in the mouse carotid artery (~28% elastin by dry weight) compared to the rabbit basilar artery (~5% elastin). Finally, the best-fit value of T act ( Table 3 ) was on the order of 10 to 25 kPa, which is reasonable for basal tone (cf. Rachev and Hayashi, 1999 ). The present results reveal quantitatively (i.e., lower best-fit value of e ) and qualitatively (i.e., greater similarity of material parameters across genotypes) that this structurally motivated model fit biaxial data from three genotypes as well as or better than did the phenomenological model, hence providing both a foundation and a motivation for pursuing related growth and remodeling models. Toward this end, it is interesting that the best-fit values of the mean collagen fiber angle were significantly less (at a p ? 0.06) for the muscular dystrophy models than for the wild-type controls. Although there is a need to determine directly if such a structural difference exists, this was not possible from the available standard histological data ( Dye et al., 2007 ). In other words, the present theoretical finding provides guidance for future experiments as it should. It is provocative to note, however, that the lower best-fit value of ? o 3 = ? ? o 4 = ? o for the two muscular dystrophy models is consistent with the previously observed lower values of in vivo axial stretch ( Dye et al., 2007 ), which in turn was thought to reflect the primary compensatory adaptation by the mdx and sgcd?/? carotids under normal hemodynamics. In conclusion, much remains to be learned with regard to compensatory adaptations by arteries during development in genetic models of disease as well as how these vessels respond to sustained alterations in hemodynamic loads in maturity. We submit that computational models will play an important role in this endeavor, thus using microstructurally motivated constitutive relations herein to quantify, for the first time, the mechanical behavior of carotid arteries from two common mouse model of muscular dystrophy is an important step toward this ultimate goal.
