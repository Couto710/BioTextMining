Human monocytes augment invasiveness and proteolytic activity of inflammatory breast cancer Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is the most aggressive form of breast cancer, and here, we examined in vitro the interactions between the human IBC cell line SUM149 and U937 human naive monocytes. We found an altered morphology, enhanced invasiveness and proteolytic activity of SUM149 cells when cultured with U937 cells or in U937-conditioned media (U937-CM). Increases in expression and activity of the cysteine protease cathepsin B and expression of caveolin-1 were also detected in SUM149 cells grown in U937-CM, thus suggesting a contribution of these proteins to the augmented invasion through and proteolysis of the extracellular matrix by the IBC cells.
