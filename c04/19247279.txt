Long-term exercise training in overweight adolescents improves plasma peptide YY and resistin The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of long-term exercise training on concentrations of five hormones related to appetite and insulin resistance in overweight adolescents. Additionally, we were interested in the relationships of these hormones with each other and with anthropometric and/or cardiovascular disease marker changes. Participants were ? the 85th percentile for body mass index for age and sex and participated in an eight month supervised aerobic training program. Anthropometrics, cardiovascular fitness assessment, and fasting blood samples were taken pre- and post-training. Glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin, active ghrelin, total peptide YY (PYY), adiponectin, and resistin concentrations were measured. The participants increased their time to exhaustion on an incremental treadmill test and decreased both percent body fat and blood triglyceride concentrations. Total PYY concentration increased and resistin concentration decreased after long-term exercise training, which are favorable outcomes. Leptin concentrations were related to weight, percent body fat, waist circumference, and triglyceride concentrations pre- and post-training. The changes in resistin concentrations were related to the changes in triglyceride concentrations. We conclude that long-term exercise training has beneficial effects for overweight adolescents with respect to PYY and resistin, hormones related to appetite and insulin sensitivity.  Subject characteristics Table 1 shows the characteristics of the 12 subjects that participated in the study. With long-term exercise training, subjects lost fat mass seen as a decrease in percent body fat of 2.2% although weight, waist circumference, and BMI did not change. There was significant improvement in time to exhaustion by one min on the treadmill although the increase in VO2peak, either as ml/kg·min or ml/kg lean body mass · min, was not significant. Absolute VO2 increased 6.5% but did not reach significance (p = 0.059). The subjects were not diabetic and had normal fasting glucose and insulin concentrations. Fasting glucose and insulin concentrations did not change with long-term exercise training. Height did not change during the duration of the study.  Cardiovascular disease risk factors Table 2 presents the circulating, fasting lipid concentrations for total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and serum triglycerides pre- and post-training. Triglyceride concentration was decreased 23% with long-term exercise training while concentrations of TC, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol did not change. The HDL:TC ratio was 3.7 and 3.5 pre- and post-training, respectively.  Plasma hormone concentrations Table 2 presents the circulating, fasting concentrations of the hormones targeted in this study. The two hormones that changed concentration significantly with long-term exercise training were resistin (8% decrease) and total PYY (23% increase). Leptin, adiponectin, and active ghrelin concentrations did not change with long-term exercise training.  Correlation between changes in triglyceride concentration and changes in resistin concentration Both triglyceride and resistin concentrations decreased with long-term exercise training. The changes from pre- to post-training in triglyceride concentrations correlated (r = 0.620, p ? 0.05) with the change in resistin concentrations. Figure 1 graphically depicts this positive relationship.  Correlation between percent body fat and leptin concentrations Leptin concentrations and percent body fat were correlated at pre-training (r = 0.832, p ? 0.001) and post-training (r = 0.872, p ? 0.0001). These positive relationships are graphically depicted in Figure 2A and 2B .  Correlation between triglyceride concentrations and leptin concentrations Leptin concentrations and triglyceride concentrations were correlated at pre-training (r = ?0.746, p ? 0.01) and post-training (r = ?0.615, p ? 0.05).

Discussion We are interested in the role of long-term exercise training on hormones related to appetite (leptin, ghrelin, and PYY) and insulin sensitivity (adiponectin and resistin) in overweight adolescents, particularly with respect to concomitant changes in these hormones that might occur with exercise training. Participants in this study participated in eight months of supervised exercise sessions. We did not have a control group of non-exercising, overweight adolescents for pre- and post-comparison which is a limitation of our study. We do not advocate overweight teens be inactive for an extended period of time and therefore did not employ a non-exercise control group for ethical reasons. We found that our participants had decreased percent body fat, decreased concentrations of triglycerices and resistin and an increased concentration of PYY in response to long-term exercise training. Pre- and post-training leptin concentrations correlated with pre- and post-training percent body fat and pre- and post-training triglyceride concentrations. The change in triglycerides correlated with the change in resistin. Long-term exercise training and cardiovascular disease risk factors The adolescents in this study were greater than the 85th percentile of BMI for age and sex. Their circulating total and LDL cholesterol concentrations pre-training were in the acceptable range for 2–19 year olds (TC < 170 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol < 110mg/dL HDL) ( 24 ). Although there were not significant changes in post-training cholesterol concentrations, the means of TC and LDL cholesterol were lower. Mean total cholesterol decreased 9% and mean LDL cholesterol decreased 4%. The HDL: total cholesterol ratio was 3.7:1 in pre-training blood samples and was 3.5:1 in the post-training samples. 3.5:1 is the optimum ratio recommended by the American Heart Association. Circulating trigycerides were in the normal range in pre-training samples but did decrease significantly (23%) with training. Pre- and post-training lipid profiles in adolescents that participate in exercise training studies do not always show much change or improvements ( 25 , 26 ). Long-term exercise training effects on appetite-related hormones PYY is the intestine-derived hormone that is produced in response to caloric load and inhibits appetite and food intake ( 13 , 14 ). It has been demonstrated that PYY concentrations increase within minutes of ingesting a meal, peak at approximately 60 min, and remain elevated for up to 6 h ( 13 ). An increase in fasting PYY would suggest a reduction in appetite. A long-term exercise training study measuring PYY has not been previously published. The largest change in appetite-related hormones in the present study occurred in circulating total PYY concentrations (+23%). An acute exercise study that measured PYY in adult subjects found that PYY release was increased during exercise and similar to non-exercisers after exercise ( 27 ). Our results suggest that long-term exercise training, as opposed to acute exercise, increases fasting total PYY in overweight adolescents. PYY circulates as PYY1–36 and PYY3–36. PYY3–36 administered to humans reduces food intake suggesting it is the relevant form for appetite control ( 15 ). In the fed state, PYY3–36 is approximately 63% of circulating total PYY and in the fasted state is approximately 37% of circulating total PYY( 28 ). A limitation to our study is that we did not determine the concentrations of PYY1–36 and PYY3–36 so we do not know if the increase was in the relevant form of PYY for appetite reduction. Additionally, we did not measure PYY after feeding which would have further defined the long-term exercise effect on this hormone that is sensitive to caloric load. Our subjects did lose fat mass, but we did not collect any information regarding food intake or diet; therefore, we do not know what role increased total PYY might have played in the loss of fat mass. Determining the concentrations of PYY3–36 with long-term exercise training in the fasted and fed state would further define the potential for exercise to regulate PYY concentrations in adolescents as well as adults. In our participants, long-term exercise training did not alter mean active ghrelin concentrations in the fasted state. Ghrelin is produced in the stomach and concentrations increase before each meal and rapidly decline in the interval between meals suggesting ghrelin initiates food intake ( 12 , 29 ). Exercise may not have a direct effect on ghrelin production because studies that test this typically report changes in ghrelin concentrations only if weight loss occurred as a result of the exercise program ( 30 , 31 ). The cited studies were performed on either healthy weight ( 31 ) or overweight ( 30 ) participants. Ghrelin circulates in an active (octanoylated) form and inactive form ( 32 ). The present study is the first to determine active (octanoylated) ghrelin concentrations in response to long-term exercise training in overweight adolescents. Our participants did not lose weight and did not exhibit a change in active ghrelin concentration with long-term exercise training. Our results measuring active ghrelin parallel other studies reporting that exercise training does not affect total ghrelin concentrations if weight-loss does not occur with training. A limitation to our study is that we did not measure ghrelin in an interval between meals to determine if long-term exercise impacts the decline of ghrelin seen between meals. Mean fasting leptin was reduced 19% by long-term exercise training in overweight adolescents in our study, but this difference was not significant (p = 0.165). Although an effect of elevated leptin is to suppress eating, leptin concentrations are elevated in overweight adolescents ( 33 ). Leptin release from fat cells is related to fat cell size and content ( 10 ). There are several reports of leptin concentrations being related to changing body composition (BMI, body fat) and waist circumference in children and adolescents ( 34 , 35 ). We found that leptin concentrations were significantly correlated with pre- and post-training weights (r = 0.696, p ? 0.02 and r = 0.887 p ? 0.001, respectively) (data not shown) and with pre- and post-waist circumferences which did not change with long-term exercise training (r = 0.599, p ? 0.05 and r = 0.775, p ? 0.01, respectively) (data not shown). In this study percent body fat correlated with leptin concentration before long-term exercise training (r = 0.832, p ? 0.001) and remained correlated (r = 0.872, p ? 0.001) after a significant decrease in percent body fat (2.2%). It has been demonstrated that leptin concentrations remain correlated with fat mass after a small fat loss in children (mean age nine years) ( 36 ). It has also been demonstrated that changes in fat mass were related to changes in leptin in obese boys and girls after three weeks of low-calorie diet and physical activity ( 37 ). This has not been demonstrated in overweight adolescents and we did not see a relationship between the change in leptin concentrations and the change in percent body fat. Pre- and post-training triglyceride concentrations negatively correlated with the corresponding concentrations of leptin (r = ?0.746, p ? 0.01 and r = ?0.615, p ? 0.0.05, respectively). There was also a negative relationship in both pre- and post-training percent body fat and triglycerides (r = ?0.572, p ? 0.10 and r = ?0.663 p ? 0.0.02, respectively) (data not shown). Although percent body fat was positively correlated with leptin concentrations pre- and post-training, we cannot explain why an increase in circulating triglycerides would be inversely related with decrease in both percent body fat and leptin concentrations. Long-term exercise training effects on insulin sensitivity hormones Mean fasting resistin concentrations were significantly decreased (9%) by long-term exercise training in our participants. A reduction in resistin concentration would be interpreted as a positive change because resistin plays a role in insulin resistance. We are not aware of any published data on the effect of long-term exercise training on resistin concentrations in adolescents. In adult subjects that are diabetic or have impaired glucose tolerance, there are mixed results as to whether long-term exercise training increases or does not alter resistin concentrations, suggesting that training does not consistently produce favorable changes in resistin concentration ( 38 , 39 ). Kadoglou et al. found a reduction in resistin levels of 31% in adults with type 2 diabetes with long-term exercise training ( 38 ). Our participants had a reduction of 9% in resistin concentration with long-term exercise training. The similarity between our two studies is the intensity and duration of each aerobic exercise session. It is difficult to interpret if the 9% decrease in resistin impacts insulin resistance since our subjects were not insulin resistant. Our study does suggest that long-term exercise alters the concentration of resistin and further study is warranted in determining the impact of exercise-regulation of resistin in those that are insulin resistant. Adiponectin is associated with increased insulin sensitivity and plays a role in reducing hyperglycemia ( 16 ). In our study, mean fasting adiponectin was not altered by long-term exercise training in overweight adolescents which had normal glucose and insulin concentrations. In a study looking at insulin sensitivity changes in overweight and obese adolescents with 12-weeks of aerobic exercise training, insulin sensitivity did increase, but adiponectin concentrations did not ( 40 ). Body weight and percentage fat did not change in this study. Kraemer and Castracane reviewed the literature on exercise and adiponectin and concluded that exercise of sufficient intensity for a period of two months or greater had a beneficial effect on adiponectin; however, it could not be determined whether long-term exercise training directly altered adiponectin or whether it was the weight reduction resulting from long-term exercise training that directly upregulated adipose tissue production of adiponection ( 41 ). Relationship of ghrelin, resistin, and leptin pre- and post-training We found a relationship between pre-training ghrelin concentration and pre-training resistin concentration (r = 0.648, p ? 0.05) (data not shown). Post-training concentration of these two hormones were not correlated (r = 0.217). We did not find a change in ghrelin after training and decreases in ghrelin do not appear to occur unless there is weight loss, which did not occur in our participants. Resistin is linked with obesity; percent body fat and resistin concentrations decreased in our participants. These results may account for the loss of the relationship of ghrelin and resistin post-training. Exercise results in better regulation of the balance between energy intake and energy expenditure which may result in the loss of the relationship of ghrelin and resistin. Additionally, there was a relationship between post-training leptin concentration and post-training resistin concentration (r = 0.646, p ? 0.05) (data not shown). Pre-training concentrations of these hormones were not related (r = 0.528) at the criterion confidence level of p ? 0.05 but was at a level of p ? 0.10 (data not shown). These findings are indicative of leptin and resistin release being related to fat mass. In agreement with our findings in overweight adolescents is a study completed by Jung et al. in which obese adults who lost weight and percent body fat with a diet and exercise intervention also had decreases in leptin and resistin concentrations ( 42 ). In summary, we found that long-term exercise training increased total PYY and decreased resistin in overweight adolescents. These are favorable changes in as PYY plays a role in decreasing appetite and resistin is related to increasing insulin resistance. Circulating leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin concentrations were not altered with long-term exercise training. Leptin was correlated with weight, waist circumference, and percent body fat. Circulating triglyceride concentrations were inversely related to leptin concentrations, which might suggest a relationship between fat metabolism with exercise and the production of leptin. We conclude that long-term exercise training has beneficial effects for overweight adolescents with respect to PYY and resistin, two hormones related to appetite and insulin sensitivity.

The HDL: total cholesterol ratio was 3.7:1 in pre-training blood samples and was 3.5:1 in the post-training samples. 3.5:1 is the optimum ratio recommended by the American Heart Association. Circulating trigycerides were in the normal range in pre-training samples but did decrease significantly (23%) with training. Pre- and post-training lipid profiles in adolescents that participate in exercise training studies do not always show much change or improvements ( 25 , 26 ).  Long-term exercise training effects on appetite-related hormones PYY is the intestine-derived hormone that is produced in response to caloric load and inhibits appetite and food intake ( 13 , 14 ). It has been demonstrated that PYY concentrations increase within minutes of ingesting a meal, peak at approximately 60 min, and remain elevated for up to 6 h ( 13 ). An increase in fasting PYY would suggest a reduction in appetite. A long-term exercise training study measuring PYY has not been previously published. The largest change in appetite-related hormones in the present study occurred in circulating total PYY concentrations (+23%). An acute exercise study that measured PYY in adult subjects found that PYY release was increased during exercise and similar to non-exercisers after exercise ( 27 ). Our results suggest that long-term exercise training, as opposed to acute exercise, increases fasting total PYY in overweight adolescents. PYY circulates as PYY1–36 and PYY3–36. PYY3–36 administered to humans reduces food intake suggesting it is the relevant form for appetite control ( 15 ). In the fed state, PYY3–36 is approximately 63% of circulating total PYY and in the fasted state is approximately 37% of circulating total PYY( 28 ). A limitation to our study is that we did not determine the concentrations of PYY1–36 and PYY3–36 so we do not know if the increase was in the relevant form of PYY for appetite reduction. Additionally, we did not measure PYY after feeding which would have further defined the long-term exercise effect on this hormone that is sensitive to caloric load. Our subjects did lose fat mass, but we did not collect any information regarding food intake or diet; therefore, we do not know what role increased total PYY might have played in the loss of fat mass. Determining the concentrations of PYY3–36 with long-term exercise training in the fasted and fed state would further define the potential for exercise to regulate PYY concentrations in adolescents as well as adults. In our participants, long-term exercise training did not alter mean active ghrelin concentrations in the fasted state. Ghrelin is produced in the stomach and concentrations increase before each meal and rapidly decline in the interval between meals suggesting ghrelin initiates food intake ( 12 , 29 ). Exercise may not have a direct effect on ghrelin production because studies that test this typically report changes in ghrelin concentrations only if weight loss occurred as a result of the exercise program ( 30 , 31 ). The cited studies were performed on either healthy weight ( 31 ) or overweight ( 30 ) participants. Ghrelin circulates in an active (octanoylated) form and inactive form ( 32 ). The present study is the first to determine active (octanoylated) ghrelin concentrations in response to long-term exercise training in overweight adolescents. Our participants did not lose weight and did not exhibit a change in active ghrelin concentration with long-term exercise training. Our results measuring active ghrelin parallel other studies reporting that exercise training does not affect total ghrelin concentrations if weight-loss does not occur with training. A limitation to our study is that we did not measure ghrelin in an interval between meals to determine if long-term exercise impacts the decline of ghrelin seen between meals. Mean fasting leptin was reduced 19% by long-term exercise training in overweight adolescents in our study, but this difference was not significant (p = 0.165). Although an effect of elevated leptin is to suppress eating, leptin concentrations are elevated in overweight adolescents ( 33 ). Leptin release from fat cells is related to fat cell size and content ( 10 ). There are several reports of leptin concentrations being related to changing body composition (BMI, body fat) and waist circumference in children and adolescents ( 34 , 35 ). We found that leptin concentrations were significantly correlated with pre- and post-training weights (r = 0.696, p ? 0.02 and r = 0.887 p ? 0.001, respectively) (data not shown) and with pre- and post-waist circumferences which did not change with long-term exercise training (r = 0.599, p ? 0.05 and r = 0.775, p ? 0.01, respectively) (data not shown). In this study percent body fat correlated with leptin concentration before long-term exercise training (r = 0.832, p ? 0.001) and remained correlated (r = 0.872, p ? 0.001) after a significant decrease in percent body fat (2.2%). It has been demonstrated that leptin concentrations remain correlated with fat mass after a small fat loss in children (mean age nine years) ( 36 ). It has also been demonstrated that changes in fat mass were related to changes in leptin in obese boys and girls after three weeks of low-calorie diet and physical activity ( 37 ). This has not been demonstrated in overweight adolescents and we did not see a relationship between the change in leptin concentrations and the change in percent body fat. Pre- and post-training triglyceride concentrations negatively correlated with the corresponding concentrations of leptin (r = ?0.746, p ? 0.01 and r = ?0.615, p ? 0.0.05, respectively). There was also a negative relationship in both pre- and post-training percent body fat and triglycerides (r = ?0.572, p ? 0.10 and r = ?0.663 p ? 0.0.02, respectively) (data not shown). Although percent body fat was positively correlated with leptin concentrations pre- and post-training, we cannot explain why an increase in circulating triglycerides would be inversely related with decrease in both percent body fat and leptin concentrations.

Long-term exercise training effects on insulin sensitivity hormones Mean fasting resistin concentrations were significantly decreased (9%) by long-term exercise training in our participants. A reduction in resistin concentration would be interpreted as a positive change because resistin plays a role in insulin resistance. We are not aware of any published data on the effect of long-term exercise training on resistin concentrations in adolescents. In adult subjects that are diabetic or have impaired glucose tolerance, there are mixed results as to whether long-term exercise training increases or does not alter resistin concentrations, suggesting that training does not consistently produce favorable changes in resistin concentration ( 38 , 39 ). Kadoglou et al. found a reduction in resistin levels of 31% in adults with type 2 diabetes with long-term exercise training ( 38 ). Our participants had a reduction of 9% in resistin concentration with long-term exercise training. The similarity between our two studies is the intensity and duration of each aerobic exercise session. It is difficult to interpret if the 9% decrease in resistin impacts insulin resistance since our subjects were not insulin resistant. Our study does suggest that long-term exercise alters the concentration of resistin and further study is warranted in determining the impact of exercise-regulation of resistin in those that are insulin resistant. Adiponectin is associated with increased insulin sensitivity and plays a role in reducing hyperglycemia ( 16 ). In our study, mean fasting adiponectin was not altered by long-term exercise training in overweight adolescents which had normal glucose and insulin concentrations. In a study looking at insulin sensitivity changes in overweight and obese adolescents with 12-weeks of aerobic exercise training, insulin sensitivity did increase, but adiponectin concentrations did not ( 40 ). Body weight and percentage fat did not change in this study. Kraemer and Castracane reviewed the literature on exercise and adiponectin and concluded that exercise of sufficient intensity for a period of two months or greater had a beneficial effect on adiponectin; however, it could not be determined whether long-term exercise training directly altered adiponectin or whether it was the weight reduction resulting from long-term exercise training that directly upregulated adipose tissue production of adiponection ( 41 ).  Long-term exercise training effects on insulin sensitivity hormones Mean fasting resistin concentrations were significantly decreased (9%) by long-term exercise training in our participants. A reduction in resistin concentration would be interpreted as a positive change because resistin plays a role in insulin resistance.

Relationship of ghrelin, resistin, and leptin pre- and post-training We found a relationship between pre-training ghrelin concentration and pre-training resistin concentration (r = 0.648, p ? 0.05) (data not shown). Post-training concentration of these two hormones were not correlated (r = 0.217). We did not find a change in ghrelin after training and decreases in ghrelin do not appear to occur unless there is weight loss, which did not occur in our participants. Resistin is linked with obesity; percent body fat and resistin concentrations decreased in our participants. These results may account for the loss of the relationship of ghrelin and resistin post-training. Exercise results in better regulation of the balance between energy intake and energy expenditure which may result in the loss of the relationship of ghrelin and resistin. Additionally, there was a relationship between post-training leptin concentration and post-training resistin concentration (r = 0.646, p ? 0.05) (data not shown). Pre-training concentrations of these hormones were not related (r = 0.528) at the criterion confidence level of p ? 0.05 but was at a level of p ? 0.10 (data not shown). These findings are indicative of leptin and resistin release being related to fat mass. In agreement with our findings in overweight adolescents is a study completed by Jung et al. in which obese adults who lost weight and percent body fat with a diet and exercise intervention also had decreases in leptin and resistin concentrations ( 42 ). In summary, we found that long-term exercise training increased total PYY and decreased resistin in overweight adolescents. These are favorable changes in as PYY plays a role in decreasing appetite and resistin is related to increasing insulin resistance. Circulating leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin concentrations were not altered with long-term exercise training. Leptin was correlated with weight, waist circumference, and percent body fat. Circulating triglyceride concentrations were inversely related to leptin concentrations, which might suggest a relationship between fat metabolism with exercise and the production of leptin. We conclude that long-term exercise training has beneficial effects for overweight adolescents with respect to PYY and resistin, two hormones related to appetite and insulin sensitivity.  Relationship of ghrelin, resistin, and leptin pre- and post-training We found a relationship between pre-training ghrelin concentration and pre-training resistin concentration (r = 0.648, p ? 0.05) (data not shown).
