Flipping the paradigm on malaria transmission-blocking vaccines The idea of malaria transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) surfaced more than two decades ago. Since then, the research paradigm focused on developing TBVs that target surface antigens of parasite sexual stages. Only recently has an effort emerged that flipped this paradigm, targeting antigens of the parasiteâ€™s obligate invertebrate vector, the Anopheles mosquito. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of mosquito-based TBVs and discuss the utility of this approach for future vaccine development.
