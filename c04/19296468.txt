MicroRNA-21 is overexpressed in human cholangiocarcinoma and regulates programmed cell death 4 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 Cholangiocarcinomas (CCA) are aggressive cancers, with a high mortality and poor survival rate. Only radical surgery offers patients some hope of cure; however, most patients are not surgical candidates because of the late diagnosis secondary to relatively poor accuracy diagnostic means. MicroRNAs (miRs) are involved in every cancer examined, but they have not been evaluated in primary CCA. In this study, miR arrays were performed on 5 primary CCAs and 5 normal bile duct specimens (NBD). Several miRs were dysregulated, and miR-21 was overexpressed, in CCAs. miR-21 differential expression in these 10 specimens was verified with quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). To validate these findings, qRT-PCR for miR-21 was then performed on 18 additional primary CCAs and 12 normal liver specimens. MiR-21 was 95% sensitive and 100% specific in distinguishing between CCA and normal tissues, with an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.995. Inhibitors of miR-21 increased protein levels of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3). Notably, messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of TIMP3 were significantly lower in CCAs than in normals. Conclusions MiR-21 is overexpressed in human CCAs. Furthermore, miR-21 may be oncogenic, at least in part, by inhibiting PDCD4 and TIMP3. Finally, these data suggest that TIMP3 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in the biliary tree.  Materials and Methods Human tissues The first 5 CCA specimens were obtained at surgery performed at Johns Hopkins University. We also collected 5 primary normal bile duct (NBD) specimens from surgical resections performed for pancreatic cancer. These patients underwent a Whipple’s procedure. Bile ducts contained in the excision specimens were confirmed histologically to be free of tumor. After the initial stage of the study, an additional number of 18 patients were included. These patients underwent resections for cholangiocarcinoma. From 12 patients, paired normal and cancer tissues were obtained. From 6 patients, only cancer tissues were obtained. Therefore, a total number of 30 specimens were added to the study: 18 cancer and 12 normal tissues. The normal tissue was confirmed histologically to not contain any cancer. Informed consent for the surgical procedure and for using the specimens for research was obtained from all patients under approved Johns Hopkins University IRB protocols. Cell lines CAK-1 and HuCCT1 were generated at Johns Hopkins University from extrahepatic CCAs 13 . TFK1 was established from a common bile duct CCA resected surgically 14 . DNA and RNA extraction Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). MicroRNA arrays 100 ng of total RNA for each specimen was used for miR arrays. We employed an Agilent Human miR array chip (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) containing 15,000 probes corresponding to 470 unique human miRs. Data was extracted using Feature Extraction Software 9.3 and GeneSpring software (Agilent). A raw array value below 5 was considered background-level. Array data was normalized to the control small RNA species printed on the slide. Data from miRs with at least 5 of 10 values above background were used for further analyses. Data was analyzed using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM, Stanford University). A false discovery rate (FDR) less than 2% was considered acceptable. Quantitative qRT-PCR (qRT-PCR) for miR expression We performed miR qqRT-PCR to confirm the expression of candidate miRs. TaqMan MiR Assays, Human (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used. Cycle passing threshold (Ct) was recorded and normalized to RNU6B expression. Relative expression was calculated as 2Ct_miR-21-Ct_RNU6B. PCR reactions were carried out in duplicate. All qRT-PCR values were calculated as ratios to the U6-normalized qRT-PCR miR-21 value in the first normal specimen. For calculating the sensitivity and specificity of miR-21 to diagnose CCAs vs. non-cancerous tissues, a cut-off of 4.5 was used. Quantitative qRT-PCR for mRNA expression iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BIO-RAD) was used. Primer sequences are available in Supplementary Table 1 . PCR products were confirmed by melting curve analysis. Beta-actin was used to normalize mRNA expression levels. Relative expression was calculated as 2Ct_target gene-Ct_beta-actin. PCR reactions were carried out in duplicate. Transfection of miR-21 inhibitor Synthesized RNA duplexes of miR-21 inhibitor were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). 30~50% confluent cells were transfected with 60nM of miR-21 inhibitor, or inhibitor-negative control using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX (Invitrogen). RNA and proteins were harvested 72 hours after transfection. To document that miR-21 inhibition does not affect the level of unrelated microRNA species, we measured the level of an unrelated microRNA, miR-590-5p. While the HuCCT1 cells treated with miR-21 inhibitor showed a significant decrease in the level of miR-21 compared to the untreated cells, the level of miR-590-5p was the same in the cells treated with miR-21 inhibitor and in the mock condition ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). To document that miR-21 transfection does not affect the level of unrelated proteins, we verified that the level of p21 were not affected. Supplemental Figure 2 shows that transfection with miR-21 inhibitor does not affect the levels of p21 in the TFK1 cholangiocarcinoma cells. Western blotting Cells were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) supplemented with a protease inhibitor (Complete, EDTA-free (Roche)). Protein concentration was measured using a BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, MA). Cell lysates (50?g) were electrophoresed on 10–20% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to Immobilon-PSQ membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with TBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween-20, then incubated with the primary antibody. Anti-PDCD4, anti-TIMP3 and anti-p21 antibodies produced in rabbit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO 63178 for PDCD4 and TIMP3 and Zymed, San Francisco, CA) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The membranes were incubated after washing with the secondary antibody, HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ) and analyzed using enhanced chemiluminescence-plus reagent (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).

Results MicroRNA arrays identify differentially expressed miRs in primary CCA specimens Microarrays were performed on 5 NBD and 5 CCAs. 221 miRs exhibited at least 50% of values above background. With the FDR set at 1.44, SAM identified 20 over- and 112 underexpressed miRs in CCAs vs. NBDs. This dysregulation imbalance agreed with previous elegant in vitro CCA studies 11 . The top 10 miRs in each category are listed in Table 2 . MiR-200b, overexpressed in CCA cell lines Mz-ChA-1 and TFK 11 , was not overexpressed in our primary CCAs. Similarly, although overexpressed in cell lines 11 , miR-141 was not overexpressed in our primary CCAs. Conversely, miRs -93, -25, -21, and -27a, were found overexpressed both in CCA cell lines 11 and in our primary CCAs. Of note, the miR 25-93-106b cluster was recently found overexpressed and involved in gastric cancer 15 . Interestingly, miR-106b, of the same family with miRs -93 and -25, was also overexpressed in our primary CCAs. Among miRs underexpressed in primary CCAs, miR-560 has not been previously described in human cancers. In contrast, miR-370, was found underexpressed in both our primary CCAs and in cell lines 12 . Analogously, miR-198, underexpressed in our primary CCAs, is underexpressed in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) 16 . MiR-21 is overexpressed in human CCA specimens In our array data, miR-21 was the most fold overexpressed microRNA and had the second-highest SAM score ( Table 2 and Figure 1 ). Its average expression was 7.7-fold greater in CCAs than in NBDs. This ratio resembles the in vitro difference reported for miR-21 in Mz-ChA-1 (2.74 fold) and in TFK (4.35 fold) 11 and agrees with similar findings in HCC tissues 17 . Moreover, a similar fold difference (4.7 to 10-fold) was reported in HCC cell lines as well as in HCC vs. normal liver tissues (2 to 65-fold) 18 . qRT-PCR data for miR-21 validate array findings Our qRT-PCR data closely matched our array data ( Figure 1 ). The Pearson correlation coefficient between array and qRT-PCR was 0.91. The average expression of miR-21 measured by qRT-PCR was 5.9 fold higher in CCAs vs. NBDs, confirming our array data. Differential qRT-PCR expression for miR-21 is validated prospectively (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>) To prospectively validate miR-21 overexpression in human CCA, we verified its expression in the remaining 30 specimens included in the study: 18 CCAs and 12 normal tissues. Normal tissues displayed uniformly low expression of miR-21, with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.34. In contrast, CCAs displayed more variable expression (SD 11.19). No correlation was found between the level of miR-21 expression and cancer location (extrahepatic vs. intrahepatic), TNM stage or histologic grade. All but one cancer displayed miR-21 levels greater than the highest value in normal specimens. The fold difference between cancer and normal groups was 5.4, consistent with our comparison of 5 cancers vs. 5 normal tissues. MiR-21 accurately discriminates between CCA and normal bile duct miR-21 correctly diagnosed 22 of 23 cancers and 17 of 17 normal specimens, yielding a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 100%. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was 0.995 ( Figure 2b ). MiR-21 targets Programmed Cell Death 4 (PDCD4) in CCA By in-silico searches, we identified PDCD4 as a potential miR-21 target. PDCD4 is downregulated in HCC tissues 19 and is involved in TGF-beta1-induced-apoptosis in an HCC cell line 19 , however, it has not been previously implicated in cholangiocarcinogenesis. By extension, we hypothesized that PDCD4 may be a tumor-suppressor-gene in CCA, and that its expression could be regulated by miR-21. Transfecting the CCA cell lines CAK1, TFK1 and HuCCT1 with a miR-21 inhibitor (miR-21i) resulted in a dramatic increase in PDCD4 protein levels ( Figure 3a ). This finding strongly suggests that PDCD4 is regulated by miR-21 in CCA. MiR-21 regulates PDCD4 at the level of protein translation in CCA specimens To elucidate the mechanism by which miR-21 regulates PDCD4, we measured mRNA levels of PDCD4 in normal liver and CCA specimens. Figure 4a shows that PDCD4 mRNA was approximately equal in CCA and normal tissues (mean level 4.32 in normal vs. 4.4 in CCAs). These findings argue that miR-21 inhibits PDCD4 protein production, rather than degrading its mRNA. Figure 4b shows that there was no effect on PDCD4 mRNA levels following miR-21i transfection of HuCCT1 and TFK1 CCA cells. This finding further suggests that, in CCA, miR-21 regulates PDCD4 at the level of protein translation. After we performed our own experiments, a similar miR-21–PDCD4 interaction was just recently observed in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK-293T 20 . Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) mRNA is statistically significantly underexpressed in CCAs By employing in-silico searches, TIMP3 was also identified as a miR-21 target in CCA. The sole study suggesting TIMP3’s involvement in cholangiocarcinogenesis reported that 8.9% of 79 intrahepatic CCA tissues displayed TIMP3 promoter hypermethylation 21 . In contrast, 42% of HCCs analyzed showed TIMP3 hypermethylation 22 , suggesting that this mechanism may be more important in HCCs. Moreover, upregulation of TIMP3 expression in the HCC cell line HCC-7721, inhibits invasion in-vitro and metastasis in nude mice 23 . To assess the expression of TIMP3 in our CCA specimens, we performed qRT-PCR of TIMP3 mRNA. Figure 5 shows that TIMP3 mRNA was significantly higher in normal than in CCA tissues. This finding strongly suggests, for the first time, that TIMP3 is an important tumor-suppressor-gene in cholangiocarcinogenesis. MiR-21 targets TIMP3 in CCA Based on the qRT-PCR assays for TIMP3 mRNA and miR-21, we hypothesized that miR-21 is a major regulator of TIMP3. To test this hypothesis, we transfected TFK1 and HuCCT1 with NSI or miR-21i and performed qRT-PCR for TIMP3 mRNA. For both TFK1 and HuCCT1, TIMP3 did not amplify to 50 cycles in both untreated and NSI-treated cells. Upon treating with miR-21i, the mRNA for TIMP3 was amplified at cycle 42 in TFK1 cells and 35 in HuCCT1 cells. We then transfected CAK1, TFK1 and HuCCT1 with miR21i or NSI. Figure 3b shows that miR-21 inhibition resulted in a remarkable increase in TIMP3 protein levels. These results show, for the first time, that miR-21 is an important regulator of TIMP3 protein level in CCA. A recent study performed in glioma cell lines demonstrated that miR-21 does not directly bind to the TIMP3 3?UTR. This finding suggests that the interaction between miR-21 and TIMP3 in glioma cell lines is likely indirect 24 .

Differential qRT-PCR expression for miR-21 is validated prospectively (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>) To prospectively validate miR-21 overexpression in human CCA, we verified its expression in the remaining 30 specimens included in the study: 18 CCAs and 12 normal tissues. Normal tissues displayed uniformly low expression of miR-21, with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.34. In contrast, CCAs displayed more variable expression (SD 11.19). No correlation was found between the level of miR-21 expression and cancer location (extrahepatic vs. intrahepatic), TNM stage or histologic grade. All but one cancer displayed miR-21 levels greater than the highest value in normal specimens. The fold difference between cancer and normal groups was 5.4, consistent with our comparison of 5 cancers vs. 5 normal tissues.  MiR-21 accurately discriminates between CCA and normal bile duct miR-21 correctly diagnosed 22 of 23 cancers and 17 of 17 normal specimens, yielding a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 100%. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was 0.995 ( Figure 2b ).

The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was 0.995 ( Figure 2b ).  MiR-21 targets Programmed Cell Death 4 (PDCD4) in CCA By in-silico searches, we identified PDCD4 as a potential miR-21 target. PDCD4 is downregulated in HCC tissues 19 and is involved in TGF-beta1-induced-apoptosis in an HCC cell line 19 , however, it has not been previously implicated in cholangiocarcinogenesis. By extension, we hypothesized that PDCD4 may be a tumor-suppressor-gene in CCA, and that its expression could be regulated by miR-21. Transfecting the CCA cell lines CAK1, TFK1 and HuCCT1 with a miR-21 inhibitor (miR-21i) resulted in a dramatic increase in PDCD4 protein levels ( Figure 3a ). This finding strongly suggests that PDCD4 is regulated by miR-21 in CCA.

This finding strongly suggests that PDCD4 is regulated by miR-21 in CCA.  MiR-21 regulates PDCD4 at the level of protein translation in CCA specimens To elucidate the mechanism by which miR-21 regulates PDCD4, we measured mRNA levels of PDCD4 in normal liver and CCA specimens. Figure 4a shows that PDCD4 mRNA was approximately equal in CCA and normal tissues (mean level 4.32 in normal vs. 4.4 in CCAs). These findings argue that miR-21 inhibits PDCD4 protein production, rather than degrading its mRNA. Figure 4b shows that there was no effect on PDCD4 mRNA levels following miR-21i transfection of HuCCT1 and TFK1 CCA cells. This finding further suggests that, in CCA, miR-21 regulates PDCD4 at the level of protein translation. After we performed our own experiments, a similar miR-21–PDCD4 interaction was just recently observed in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK-293T 20 .

Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) mRNA is statistically significantly underexpressed in CCAs By employing in-silico searches, TIMP3 was also identified as a miR-21 target in CCA. The sole study suggesting TIMP3’s involvement in cholangiocarcinogenesis reported that 8.9% of 79 intrahepatic CCA tissues displayed TIMP3 promoter hypermethylation 21 . In contrast, 42% of HCCs analyzed showed TIMP3 hypermethylation 22 , suggesting that this mechanism may be more important in HCCs. Moreover, upregulation of TIMP3 expression in the HCC cell line HCC-7721, inhibits invasion in-vitro and metastasis in nude mice 23 . To assess the expression of TIMP3 in our CCA specimens, we performed qRT-PCR of TIMP3 mRNA. Figure 5 shows that TIMP3 mRNA was significantly higher in normal than in CCA tissues. This finding strongly suggests, for the first time, that TIMP3 is an important tumor-suppressor-gene in cholangiocarcinogenesis.

MiR-21 targets TIMP3 in CCA Based on the qRT-PCR assays for TIMP3 mRNA and miR-21, we hypothesized that miR-21 is a major regulator of TIMP3. To test this hypothesis, we transfected TFK1 and HuCCT1 with NSI or miR-21i and performed qRT-PCR for TIMP3 mRNA. For both TFK1 and HuCCT1, TIMP3 did not amplify to 50 cycles in both untreated and NSI-treated cells. Upon treating with miR-21i, the mRNA for TIMP3 was amplified at cycle 42 in TFK1 cells and 35 in HuCCT1 cells. We then transfected CAK1, TFK1 and HuCCT1 with miR21i or NSI. Figure 3b shows that miR-21 inhibition resulted in a remarkable increase in TIMP3 protein levels. These results show, for the first time, that miR-21 is an important regulator of TIMP3 protein level in CCA. A recent study performed in glioma cell lines demonstrated that miR-21 does not directly bind to the TIMP3 3?UTR. This finding suggests that the interaction between miR-21 and TIMP3 in glioma cell lines is likely indirect 24 .

Discussion Previous seminal microRNA research in CCA has been performed in cell lines 11 , 12 , 25 . Interestingly, work from Dr. Tushar Patel’s laboratory revealed that microRNA profiles are not identical in CCA cell lines 11 . This finding suggests that different miRs exert unique carcinogenetic contributions, depending on the particular environment in which they occur. Therefore, in the first stage of our study, we used human primary CCA specimens rather than cell lines, in an attempt to appreciate the impact that miRs may exert on cholangiocarcinogenesis in vivo . Our results confirmed many, although not all, of the profiling results found in cell lines. Among miRs overexpressed in primary human CCA tissues, miR-21 had also been reported in previous cell line research 11 , perhaps because of its paramount involvement in the cholangiocarcinogenesis. Although miR-21 has been reported as overexpressed in a variety of tumors 18 , 24 , 26 – 29 , it has not been reported in primary human CCA tissues. Moreover, our study suggests that miR-21 is uniformly overexpressed in human CCA, in view of our finding that it was 95 % sensitive and 100% specific in diagnosing human CCA. This finding may address the existing difficulty of diagnosing CCA by current means, such as imaging. PDCD4 was initially identified as an upregulated apoptosis-related protein 30 , suggesting its role as a tumor-suppressor-gene 31 . While PDCD4 was recently reported as a potential tumor-suppressor in hepatocarcinogenesis 19 , our work is the first reporting its involvement in cholangiocarcinogenesis. Moreover, this is the first report of PDCD4 being inhibited by miR-21 in CCA. The interaction between miR-21 and PDCD4 was previously reported in breast cancer 20 , 32 , 33 and colon cancer 34 suggesting that this interplay may be a general carcinogenetic pathway, rather than a tissue-specific mechanism. Furthermore, since the mRNA levels of PDCD4 were similar in human CCA and normal specimens, we conclude that miR-21-induced PDCD4 inhibition is posttranscriptional ( Figure 4a ). Confirming our findings, a similar level of mRNA for PDCD4 was found in colon cancer and normal specimens in a previous study 34 . As shown before in Colo206f, HeLa and HEK-293T cells, miR-21 directly binds to its binding site in the 3?UTR of PDCD4 20 , 32 – 34 . Matrix metalloproteinases play a crucial role in cancer invasion and metastasis 35 . Among the 4 members of the family, TIMP3 is uniquely pro-apoptotic 35 . For example, the adenoviral transfer of TIMP3 into HeLa, HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, and melanoma cells reduces their invasiveness and stimulates apoptosis 36 , 37 . More recently, herpes simplex-mediated transfer of TIMP3 into neuroblastoma and malignant peripheral nerve tumor xenografts reduced tumor growth and reduced density of the tumor vascular network 38 . Nonetheless, there are no previous reports regarding the roles of TIMP3 in CCA. A singular manuscript reported low-level promoter methylation of TIMP3 in intrahepatic CCA 21 . Our manuscript is the first to report 1) lower levels of mRNA for TIMP3 in human CCA specimens compared to normal human specimens; 2) an inhibitory effect of miR-21 on TIMP3 in CCA cell lines. Taken together, these findings provide support for our hypothesis that TIMP3 is a tumor-suppressor-gene in CCA and that its activity is closely regulated by miR-21.
