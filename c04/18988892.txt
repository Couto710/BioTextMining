The potent and selective PPAR-? agonist LY518674 upregulates both apoA-I production and catabolism in human subjects with the metabolic syndrome Objective The study of PPAR-? activation on apoA-I production in humans has been limited to fibrates, relatively weak PPAR-? agonists that may have other molecular effects. We sought to determine the effect of a potent and highly specific PPAR-? agonist, LY518674, on apoA-I, apoA-II and apoB-100 kinetics in humans with metabolic syndrome and low levels of HDL cholesterol (C). Methods and Results Subjects were randomized to receive LY518674 (100 ?g) once daily (n=13) or placebo (n=15) for 8 weeks. Subjects underwent a kinetic study using a deuterated leucine tracer to measure apolipoprotein production and fractional catabolic rates (FCR) at baseline and following treatment. LY518674 significantly reduced VLDL-C (?38%, p=0.002) and triglyceride (?23%, p=0.002) levels while LDL-C and HDL-C levels were unchanged. LY518674 significantly reduced VLDL apoB-100 (?12%, p=0.01) levels, due to an increased VLDL apoB-100 FCR with no change in VLDL apoB-100 production. IDL and LDL apoB-100 kinetics were unchanged. LY518674 significantly increased of the apoA-I production rate by 31% (p< 0.0001) but this was accompanied by a 33% increase in the apoA-I FCR (p=0.002), resulting in no change in plasma apoA-I. There was a 71% increase in the apoA-II production rate (p< 0.0001) accompanied by a 25% increase in the FCR (p< 0.0001), resulting in a significant increase in plasma apoA-II. Conclusions Activation of PPAR-? with of LY518674 (100 ?g) in subjects with metabolic syndrome and low HDL-C increased the VLDL apoB-100 FCR consistent with enhanced lipolysis of plasma triglyceride. Significant increases in the apoA-I and apoA-II production rates were accompanied by increased FCRs resulting in no change in HDL-C levels. These data indicate a major effect of LY518674 on the production and clearance of apoA-I and HDL despite no change in the plasma concentration. The effect of these changes on reverse cholesterol transport remains to be determined.

All subjects had low HDL-C (<40 mg/dL for men; HDL-C <50 mg/dL for women) and at least two additional risk factors for metabolic syndrome as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. Subjects on a stable dose of statin therapy ( >4 weeks prior to start of the study) were eligible to participate. Exclusion criteria included current treatment with fibrates, thiazolinedienones, ezetimibe, niacin (>250 mg/day) or fish oil (>2.5 g/day); history of cardiovascular or renal disease or diabetes; serum creatinine level greater than 2.0 mg/dL; uncontrolled blood pressure (>160/100 mmHg); abnormal measures of thyroid function; aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal; history of a major active rheumatologic, pulmonary, dermatologic disease or inflammatory condition. All protocols and procedures were approved by the Human Investigational Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania. All subjects gave written, informed consent. Study Design This study was a single site, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel study. Eligible subjects were admitted to the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at the University of Pennsylvania for baseline fasting blood collection and a kinetic study to measure baseline apolipoprotein production and fractional catabolic rates (FCR). Prior to discharge, subjects were randomized to receive LY518674 (100 ?g) or placebo to be taken once daily for 8 weeks. The 100 ?g dose of LY518674 was selected for being both safe and effective in preclinical and phase I studies. Subjects returned to the GCRC at bi-weekly intervals for safety visits. At the end of the 8 week treatment period, subjects returned to the GCRC for a second kinetic study after which treatment was discontinued. Subjects returned for a final safety visit two weeks after their last dose. Kinetic study Apolipoprotein kinetics were measured under constantly-fed conditions as previously described ( 14 ). Briefly, subjects were fed a standardized meal representing 1/20th of their daily caloric intake hourly for 20 hours. After the initial 5 hours of feeding, participants were given a bolus of [5,5,5-D3]-leucine (10 ?mol/kg) immediately followed by a constant infusion of [5,5,5-D3]-leucine (10 ?mol/kg per hour) for the remaining 15 hours. Blood samples were collected at various timepoints during the infusion. Pool sizes for apoA-I, apoA-II and apoB100 in each lipoprotein fraction were calculated as plasma concentration(mg/dL) multiplied by plasma volume (0.45 dL/kg body weight). ApoB100 production rates and FCRs were measured using the WinSAAM modeling program by fitting VLDL, IDL and LDL apoB100 tracer data to a modified apoB100 model ( 15 ) with IDL remnant to LDL conversion. HDL apoA-I and apoA-II production rates and FCRs were measured using WinSAAM by fitting a rising monoexponetial curve containing a secretory delay to the HDL apoA-I and apoA-II tracer data ( 16 ). The VLDLapoB-100 tracer plateau was used as the tracer plateau for apoA-I and apoA-II analysis. Plasma lipid and lipoprotein measurements Plasma lipids were measured in EDTA plasma collected after a 12-hour fast in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-standardized laboratory. Plasma total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, and triglycerides were measured enzymatically on a Cobas Fara II autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostic Systems Inc, Basel, Switzerland) using Sigma reagents (Sigma Chemical Co, St. Louis, MO). Very low–density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) levels were determined after ultracentrifugation at a density of 1.006 g/mL. LDL-C was determined by subtraction of VLDL-C and HDL-C from TC. Apolipoproteins were measured using Wako reagents (Wako Chemicals USA Inc, Richmond, VA). Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] was measured using an immunoturbidometric assay (Wako Chemicals USA Inc., Richmond, VA). Lipoprotein particle sizes were measured using NMR (LipoScience, Raleigh, NC). Oxidized LDL was measured using an oxidized LDL competitive ELISA (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). CETP, LCAT and Lipase Measurements CETP activity was measured using a commercially available assay (Roar Biomedical, New York, NY). Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity was measured by determination of the cholesterol esterification rate in plasma as previously described ( 17 ). Lipoprotein lipase activity in post-heparin plasma collected 10 minutes following an intravenous heparin injection (60 units/kg body weight) was measured using a commercially available substrate (Marker Gene Technologies, Eugene, OR). Phospholipase A1 activity in post-heparin plasma was measured using a proprietary assay with a within-run coefficient of variation of 5%. Cellular cholesterol efflux studies Cholesterol efflux from murine bone marrow derived macrophages to patient serum at baseline and at the end of the treatment period was measured as previously described ( 18 ). Studies were done in the presence and absence of probucol to determine ABCA1-specific and non-specific efflux. Statistical Analysis Differences between treatment groups were determined using analysis of covariance using the baseline measure as a covariate. Analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A two-tailed p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The data are presented as means ± SD. The percentagechange with treatment relative to baseline was computed for individual subjects and presented as the mean for each group. Median percent change is used for those variables where the percent change had a skewed distribution (triglyceride, VLDL cholesterol, apoC-II, apoC-III, lipoprotein lipase activity).  Subjects Men and women (18–80 years) were recruited from the local area. All subjects had low HDL-C (<40 mg/dL for men; HDL-C <50 mg/dL for women) and at least two additional risk factors for metabolic syndrome as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III.

Results Subjects Forty one subjects were recruited to participate in the study of which 37 were ultimately enrolled. Of those enrolled, 18 subjects were randomized to receive LY518674 (100 ?g once daily) and 19 subjects were randomized to placebo for 8 weeks. Five subjects randomized to LY518674 discontinued study drug after completing between 2–4 weeks of the treatment period (1 for taking an exclusionary medication, 4 at request of the study sponsor 1 ). Seven subjects randomized to placebo discontinued treatment (1 for taking an exclusionary medication, 1 voluntarily withdrew, 1 for an adverse event, and 4 at request of the study sponsor). Subjects that discontinued treatment at the request of the sponsor were given the option of completing the remaining procedures according to protocol. For data analysis, the LY518674 treatment group includes the 13 subjects in this group who completed treatment according to protocol. The placebo treatment group includes 12 subjects who completed treatment according to protocol and 3 subjects who discontinued treatment but completed all study procedures for a total of 15 subjects. Baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Subjects in the LY518674 and placebo groups had similar baseline characteristics with no significant differences between groups. Effects on plasma lipids, apolipoproteins, and lipoprotein particles The results for changes in plasma lipid and apolipoprotein levels are shown in Table 2 . There was a significant decrease of 6% in plasma total cholesterol levels in subjects treated with LY518674 as compared to a 6% increase with placebo (p=0.005). This decrease was entirely due to a reduction in VLDL-C. There were no significant changes in either LDL-C, Lp(a) or HDL-C levels in response to LY518674 treatment. Plasma triglyceride levels were reduced by 30% in the LY518674 treatment group as compared to a 7% increase in the placebo group ( p <0.002). ApoC-II and apoC-III levels were significantly decreased by 24% and 32%, respectively, in the LY518674 treatment group as compared to increases of 22% and 16% in the placebo group. LDL particle size significantly ( p =0.0007) increased as compared to placebo from 20.17 ± 0.43 nm at baseline to 20.76 ± 0.40 nm following treatment with LY518674. Subjects in the placebo group had an LDL particle size of 20.16 ± 0.74 nm at baseline and 20.21 ± 0.59 nm at the end of the treatment period. There was a statistically significant ( p <0.002) decrease in HDL particle size after treatment with LY518674. Subjects in the LY518674 treatment group had an HDL particle size of 8.43 ± 0.23 nm at baseline as compared to 8.30 ± 0.17 nm at the end of the treatment period. Subjects in the placebo group had a HDL particle size of 8.62 ± 0.35 nm at baseline and 8.63 ± 0.35 nm at the end of the treatment period. Effects on ApoB-100 Metabolism The results for changes in apoB-100 metabolism are summarized in Table 3 . Treatment with LY518674 led to a significant reduction in the VLDL apoB-100 pool size when compared to placebo (?12% vs. 15%, respectively; p = 0.01) that was due to an increase in the VLDL apoB-100 FCR (62% vs. 1%, respectively; p =0.02). There was no significant difference in the VLDL apoB-100 production rate in patients treated with LY518674 compared with placebo (26% vs. 12%, respectively; p =0.15). There were also no significant changes in the pool size, production rate or FCR for IDL or LDL apoB-100 in subjects treated with LY518674. Effects on ApoA-I and A-II Metabolism The results for changes in apoA-I metabolism are summarized in Table 4 . There was no significant change in the apoA-I pool size in patients treated with LY518674 as compared to those treated with placebo (1% vs. ?1%, respectively; p = 0.51). There was a significant increase in the apoA-I production rate in response to LY518674 (31% vs. 0%, respectively; p =0.0001). This was accompanied by a significant increase in the clearance of apoA-I, measured as the FCR, following LY518674 treatment (33% vs. 0%, respectively; p=0.002). In contrast, the apoA-II pool size was increased significantly in patients treated with LY518674 as compared to those treated with placebo (36% vs. 5%, respectively; p = 0.0002) ( Table 2 ). There was a significant increase in the apoA-II production rate in response to LY518674 (71% vs. 7%, respectively; p<0.0001). This was accompanied by a significant increase in the apoA-II FCR following LY518674 treatment (25% vs. 1%, respectively; p <0.0001). Effects on Cholesterol Efflux ABCA1-specific cholesterol efflux from bone marrow-derived macrophages to subject plasma, measured as % initial cholesterol effluxed from cells in 4 hrs, was unchanged by treatment with LY518674. Subjects in the LY518674 treatment group had a baseline ABCA1-specific efflux of 7.6 ± 2.7% compared to 7.2 ± 3.1% at the end of the treatment period. Subjects in the placebo group had a baseline ABCA1-specific efflux of 7.8 ± 2.0% compared to 7.8 ± 1.8% at the end of the treatment period ( p =0.53). The ability of plasma to promote non-ABCA1-specific cholesterol efflux was also unchanged by treatment with LY518674. Subjects in the LY518674 treatment group had a baseline non-ABCA1-specific efflux of 13.7 ± 3.5% compared to 13.9 ± 3.8% at the end of the treatment period. Subjects in the placebo group had a baseline non-ABCA1-specific efflux of 15.3 ± 3.9% compared to 15.6 ± 4.0% at the end of the treatment period ( p =0.93). Effects on LCAT, CETP and Lipase Activities Treatment with LY518674 resulted in a significant reduction in plasma LCAT activity when compared with placebo (?8% vs. 13%, respectively; p =0.002). There was also a significant reduction in plasma CETP activity with LY518674 treatment as compared with placebo (?7% vs. 8%, respectively; p <0.02). Subjects in the LY518674 treatment group had a significantly increased post-heparin lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity as compared to placebo (median change 64% vs. ?14%, respectively; p =0.0005). There was no change in phospholipase A1 activity in post heparin plasma following treatment with LY518674 as compared to placebo (?2% vs. 0%, respectively p =0.16).

There was no significant change in the apoA-I pool size in patients treated with LY518674 as compared to those treated with placebo (1% vs. ?1%, respectively; p = 0.51). There was a significant increase in the apoA-I production rate in response to LY518674 (31% vs. 0%, respectively; p =0.0001). This was accompanied by a significant increase in the clearance of apoA-I, measured as the FCR, following LY518674 treatment (33% vs. 0%, respectively; p=0.002). In contrast, the apoA-II pool size was increased significantly in patients treated with LY518674 as compared to those treated with placebo (36% vs. 5%, respectively; p = 0.0002) ( Table 2 ).

Safety and tolerability please see http://atvb.ahajournals.org  Safety and tolerability please see http://atvb.ahajournals.org  Discussion LY518674 significantly increased the apoA-I production rate in subjects with low HDL-C and metabolic syndrome at the 100 ?g dose but did not change the plasma levels of apoA-I or HDL-C. This lack of change in HDL-C in response to LY518674 was similar to what was reported in a concurrent study with LY518674 at the 100 ?g dose ( 13 ). As expected there was a significant increase in the apoA-I production rate, likely the result of increased apoA-I gene transcription following activation of PPAR-? by LY518674. However, the accompanying increase in the apoA-I FCR was unexpected and accounted for the lack of change in plasma levels of apoA-I and HDL levels. This effect of a more rapid apoA-I FCR accompanying an increase in apoA-I production has been reported in studies with fenofibrate, where a 10–26% increase in apoA-I FCR accompanied a 17–49% increase in apoA-I production ( 8 – 10 ), and with lifibrol (22% increase in apoA-I FCR; 23% increase in apoA-I production) ( 19 ). In each instance the increase in the apoA-I FCR had the effect of counteracting the enhanced apoA-I production leading to modest or no changes in HDL-C levels. One likely mechanism that could contribute to the increase in apoA-I FCR in response to treatment with a PPAR-? agonist relates to the reduced LCAT activity that we observed following LY518674 treatment. Fibrates have been reported to reduce LCAT activity ( 20 , 21 ). LCAT mediates the conversion of free cholesterol, in the outer phospholipid layer of HDL, to cholesteryl ester which forms the core of HDL particles. Reduced LCAT activity results in the production of smaller HDL particles. Subjects with heterozygous LCAT deficiency, with an LCAT activity that is 39% lower than that of controls, have relatively small HDL particles ( 22 ). Small HDL particles have been associated with increased apoA-I clearance from plasma ( 23 , 24 ). In addition to reduced LCAT activity, we also found a modest reduction in CETP activity in response to LY518674. However, the significance of this change is questionable minor since reduced CETP activity would be expected to increase, rather than reduce HDL particle size. Hepatic lipase or endothelial lipase could promote the formation small HDL particles through increased activity in plasma. However, we consider this unlikely since there was no change in the post-heparin phospholipase A1 activity following treatment with LY518674. Furthermore, an increase in the apoA-I FCR and decrease in endothelial lipase mass was reported in two patients with hepatic lipase deficiency following treatment with fenofibrate ( 25 ) suggesting that these lipases are not responsible for the increase in the apoA-I FCR that accompanies fibrate treatment. Another possibility is that the increase in the apoA-I FCR is directly related to the reduction of apoC-III following LY518674 treatment. The HDL apoC-III/apoA-I ratio has been reported to be inversely associated with the apoA-I FCR ( 26 ), possibly due to an inhibitory effect of apoC-III on hepatic lipase. However, the lack of change in apoA-I levels in apoC-III transgenic mice ( 27 ) suggests this association is not causal and that other factors are likely responsible for the increase in the apoA-I FCR observed in the current study. In contrast to its effect on apoA-I levels, LY518674 significantly increased apoA-II levels in plasma. As with apoA-I, we observed increases in both the production rate and FCR of apoA-II response to treatment with LY518674. However, in this case the production rate of apoA-II was enhanced to a much greater degree that the FCR resulting in a net increase in the apoA-II level in plasma. The increased production of apoA-II is likely the result of increased apoA-II gene transcription following activation of PPAR-? by LY518674 while the mechanism responsible for the increased FCR is unknown. Since the change in the apoA-II FCR was of a similar magnitude to the change observed for the apoA-I FCR we speculate that total HDL particle clearance may be increased in response to PPAR-? activation. While the effect of apoA-II on cardiovascular risk is controversial ( 28 – 29 ) fibrate treatment increases apoA-II and has been associated with reductions in cardiovascular events suggesting no harmful effects of increasing apoA-II levels in plasma.. There was a significant reduction in the total cholesterol level in response to LY518674. This was due entirely to a reduction in VLDL-C, as LDL-C and HDL-C were unchanged in response to treatment. The reduction in VLDL-C and triglyceride can be explained by enhanced VLDL clearance resulting from an upregulation of lipoprotein lipase activity and downregulation of apoC-III in response to LY518674. ApoC-III is an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase and a reduction in apoC-III concentration would be expected to increase the hydrolysis of triglyceride on VLDL enhancing the FCR of VLDL apoB100. Despite the enhanced VLDL apoB100 clearance there was no effect of LY518674 on IDL or LDL apoB-100 production or FCR in these subjects. Apo C-III is thought to influence HDL metabolism indirectly by its effect on lipolysis which influences the amount of VLDL triglyceride available for exchange with HDL. In theory a reduction in plasma triglyceride levels should be associated with a reduced clearance of HDL from plasma since HDL enriched in triglyceride has been demonstrated to be cleared relatively rapidly from plasma ( 30 ). However, in the current study, the reduction in plasma triglyceride levels was associated with an increase in HDL apoA-I clearance suggesting that factors other than plasma triglyceride level enhance the rate of HDL apoA-I clearance in response to treatment with a PPAR-? agonist. While there was no significant change in LDL-C in response to LY518674, we did observe a significant increase in LDL particle size which is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. There was no change in HDL-C levels or in HDL subfractions as determined by NMR but there was an overall reduction in HDL size. These changes in LDL and HDL particle size in response to LY518674 are consistent with changes in LDL and HDL size reported in response to treatment with gemfibrozil ( 31 ) and fenofibrate ( 32 ). The in vitro capacity of HDL to act as an acceptor of cholesterol either ABCA-1 or ABCA-1 independent cholesterol transport mechanisms on macrophages was unchanged following treatment with LY518674. Since LY518674 likely increases HDL turnover as indicated by the increase in both the apoA-I and apoA-II FCRs, our results suggest that PPAR-? activation causes an increased cholesterol flux through the reverse cholesterol transport pathway despite no change in HDL-C levels. Such a scenario could enhance the delivery of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to liver while leaving HDL-C levels in plasma unchanged. In support of this concept, SR-BI overexpression in mice increased HDL turnover and enhanced delivery of cholesterol to liver ( 33 ), resulting in a beneficial effect on the development of atherosclerosis even though HDL-C levels were reduced. As with most metabolic studies conducted in humans, our study has a number of limitations. First, we are assuming that the changes that we are seeing in regards to apolipoprotein production are due to increased gene transcription in response to the drug. Since we are unable to measure mRNA levels in liver and intestine it is possible that other mechanisms are responsible for the observed changes. Second, our study involved patients with metabolic syndrome. It is possible that different results would have been obtained is normolipidemic subjects or in a different patient group. Third, the current study was conducted at a fixed dose of drug selected for being both safe and effective in preclinical and phase I studies. More recent data ( 13 ) suggests that lower doses of drug may have been associated with changes in apoA-I production and FCR that resulted in a net increase of apoA-I levels in plasma. In summary, treatment of subjects with low HDL-C and metabolic syndrome with the potent and highly specific PPAR-? agonist LY518674 significantly reduced triglyceride levels and increased the VLDL apoB-100 FCR. Treatment significantly increased the apoA-I and apoA-II production rates as well as the FCRs of both proteins leaving HDL levels unchanged. The effect of these changes in HDL metabolism on reverse cholesterol transport remains to be determined.
