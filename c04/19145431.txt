Cardiac resynchronization therapy evaluated by myocardial scintigraphy with 99mTc-MIBI: changes in left ventricular uptake, dyssynchrony, and function Purpose 99mTc-MIBI gated myocardial scintigraphy (GMS) evaluates myocyte integrity and perfusion, left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony and function. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may improve the clinical symptoms of heart failure (HF), but its benefits for LV function are less pronounced. We assessed whether changes in myocardial 99mTc-MIBI uptake after CRT are related to improvement in clinical symptoms, LV synchrony and performance, and whether GMS adds information for patient selection for CRT. Methods A group of 30 patients with severe HF were prospectively studied before and 3 months after CRT. Variables analysed were HF functional class, QRS duration, LV ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiography, myocardial 99mTc-MIBI uptake, LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV), phase analysis LV dyssynchrony indices, and regional motion by GMS. After CRT, patients were divided into two groups according to improvement in LVEF: group 1 (12 patients) with increase in LVEF of 5 or more points, and group 2 (18 patients) without a significant increase. Results After CRT, both groups showed a significant improvement in HF functional class, reduced QRS width and increased septal wall 99mTc-MIBI uptake. Only group 1 showed favourable changes in EDV, ESV, LV dyssynchrony indices, and regional motion. Before CRT, EDV, and ESV were lower in group 1 than in group 2. Anterior and inferior wall 99mTc-MIBI uptakes were higher in group 1 than in group 2 ( p <0.05). EDV was the only independent predictor of an increase in LVEF ( p =0.01). The optimal EDV cut-off point was 315 ml (sensitivity 89%, specificity 94%). Conclusion The evaluation of EDV by GMS added information on patient selection for CRT. After CRT, LVEF increase occurred in hearts less dilated and with more normal 99mTc-MIBI uptake.  Introduction Left bundle-branch block is frequent in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy [ 1 ]. This electric conduction disturbance can worsen left ventricular (LV) function because it leads to wall motion dyssynchrony [ 2 ]. It is well known that LV ejection fraction (LVEF) is an independent predictor of mortality and that cardiac performance and LV remodelling improvement are associated with a better prognosis [ 3 , 4 ]. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is considered an important adjunctive treatment for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, QRS duration >120 ms, especially in the presence of left bundle-branch block, and severe heart failure (HF) refractory to optimized medical therapy [ 5 , 6 ]. CRT improves clinical symptoms in the majority of patients [ 7 – 9 ], but its benefits on LV function seem to be less pronounced [ 10 , 11 ]. The mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are not completely understood. Studies have shown that the clinical improvement promoted by CRT in some patients might be just a placebo effect and that about 30% of the patients do not respond to this therapy [ 7 , 12 ]. Therefore, more refined parameters are needed to better select these patients and to show objectively the benefits promoted by this costly therapy. Experimental studies in dogs have demonstrated changes in myocardial structure [ 13 ] and regional activation of stress-response kinases and globally cell-survival signalling [ 14 ] that could be related to an improvement in previously abnormal myocyte function after correction of LV dyssynchrony. Nuclear medicine imaging is a functional method that allows the noninvasive evaluation of several pathophysiological mechanisms involved in HF [ 15 – 17 ]. The tracer technetium-99m 2-methoxy-2-isobutyl-isonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) is a lipophilic cationic molecule that was synthesized as a myocardial perfusion imaging agent. Its cellular uptake and retention are responsive to changes in cellular integrity, and mitochondrial and plasma membrane potentials [ 18 ]. Moreover, gated myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (GMS) with 99mTc-MIBI allows the evaluation of regional and global LV function [ 19 – 21 ]. In addition, a method has recently been developed to measure LV dyssynchrony from GMS [ 22 , 23 ]. The presence of transmural or intramural LV dyssynchrony could lead to impairment in perfusion and progressive deterioration of myocyte structure and function [ 13 , 14 ]. Thus, the aims of this study were to assess whether changes in myocardial 99mTc-MIBI uptake induced by CRT are related to the improvement in clinical symptoms, and LV synchrony, remodelling and function, and whether GMS with 99mTc-MIBI can add information to selection and follow-up of patients undergoing CRT.  Methods A group of 30 patients with severe HF were prospectively studied before and 3 months after CRT. Variables analysed were HF functional class, QRS duration, LV ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiography, myocardial 99mTc-MIBI uptake, LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV), phase analysis LV dyssynchrony indices, and regional motion by GMS. After CRT, patients were divided into two groups according to improvement in LVEF: group 1 (12 patients) with increase in LVEF of 5 or more points, and group 2 (18 patients) without a significant increase.  Results After CRT, both groups showed a significant improvement in HF functional class, reduced QRS width and increased septal wall 99mTc-MIBI uptake. Only group 1 showed favourable changes in EDV, ESV, LV dyssynchrony indices, and regional motion. Before CRT, EDV, and ESV were lower in group 1 than in group 2. Anterior and inferior wall 99mTc-MIBI uptakes were higher in group 1 than in group 2 ( p <0.05). EDV was the only independent predictor of an increase in LVEF ( p =0.01). The optimal EDV cut-off point was 315 ml (sensitivity 89%, specificity 94%).  Conclusion The evaluation of EDV by GMS added information on patient selection for CRT. After CRT, LVEF increase occurred in hearts less dilated and with more normal 99mTc-MIBI uptake.  Materials and methods Patients A group of 30 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic HF in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV, LVEF <35%, and left bundle-branch block (QRS ?120 ms) referred for implantation of a CRT device were prospectively included in the present study after providing written informed consent. The ethics committee of our institution approved the study protocol. These patients were rigorously selected from our Arrhythmia and Pacing Department at InCor between May 2005 and December 2007. Of the 30 patients, 19 (63%) had coronary angiography excluding coronary artery disease and 11 (37%) had previous imaging which did not show myocardial ischaemia. All of them had negative Chagas’ disease serology; therefore they were classified by their doctors as nonischaemic and nonchagasic dilated cardiomyopathy. The mean age of the patients was 59±11 years (range 37 to 79 years); 14 patients (47%) were men. Cardiac medications for HF at baseline and during follow-up included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in all 30 patients (100%), beta-blockers in 29 (97%), spironolactone in 27 (90%), diuretics in 30 (100%), and digoxin in 22 (73%). The pharmacological therapy was the same at least in the previous 1 month and was unchanged during follow-up. Patients were excluded from the study if they had atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block, or a permanent pacemaker. Study protocol Before and at least 3 months after CRT, patients underwent functional class assessment, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and GMS with 99mTc-MIBI at rest. After CRT, patients were divided into two groups according to LVEF improvement measured by 2-D echocardiography (Simpson’s rule): group 1 with an increase in LVEF of 5 or more points, and group 2 without a significant increase in LVEF. Atriobiventricular device implantation Commercially available pacemakers with an atriobiventricular system were used in all patients (Insync III 8042/Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN; Stratos LV/Biotronik, Berlin, Germany; and Frontier II/St. Jude Medical, Memphis, TN). The right atrial lead was positioned in the right atrial appendix and the ventricular lead in the right ventricular outflow. In 23 patients (77%), the LV pacing lead was implanted in a posterior or lateral branch of the coronary sinus (transvenous implant). LV lateral wall epicardial lead implantation using limited thoracotomy was performed in 7 patients (23%) because of coronary sinus approach failure. Electrocardiography Surface 12-lead electrocardiograms were recorded at a 25 mm/s speed and were evaluated by two observers without knowledge of the clinical status of the patient. QRS duration was measured on the electrocardiogram using the widest QRS complex from the DII lead. Echocardiography Transthoracic bidimensional echocardiographic studies were performed with a Philips HDI-5000 model (Philips, Andover, MA) equipped with a 2–4-MHz transducer, following American Society of Echocardiography recommendations [ 24 ]. Two experienced independent observers, who had no knowledge of the clinical data, measured LVEF using the biplane method (Simpson’s rule). GMS with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MIBI imaging protocol GMS acquisition began 45 to 60 min after tracer injection (370 MBq) at rest using a dual-detector 90° Cardio MD system (Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, WA) equipped with low-energy high-resolution collimators. All studies used the following parameters: 64 projections; 180° noncircular orbit, right anterior oblique to left posterior oblique angles; 64×64 matrix; 6.7-mm pixel size; eight frames per cardiac cycle; and 30 s per stop. GMS projection was reconstructed by an iterative method (OSEM) using five subsets and Butterworth filter (order 5, cut-off frequency 0.6 Nyquist). No attenuation correction was applied to the images. LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) were calculated using the quantitative GMS program (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA) [ 20 ]. This program evaluates the regional myocardial wall motion using the following scores in a 20-segment model: 0 normal, 1 mild hypokinesis, 2 moderate hypokinesis, 3 severe hypokinesis, 4 akinesis, and 5 dyskinesis [ 21 ]. The 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake defect size at rest was automatically calculated from the measurements of both severity (depth below the normal curve) and extent (width under the normal curve) of the myocardial perfusion abnormalities. The integrated measurement is expressed as percent LV defect size. Cardiac uptake was also quantified as a percentage of myocardial counts per segment according to a normal default and displayed as bull’s eye maps [ 19 ]. Wall motion scores and 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake values in 20 segments of LV were then grouped into six major regions: anterior (segments 1, 7 and 13), anteroseptal (segments 2, 8 and 14), inferoseptal (segments 3, 9 and 15), inferior (segments 4, 10 and 16), inferolateral (segments 5, 11 and 17) and anterolateral (segments 6, 12 and 18; Fig. 1 ). Both segments corresponding to the apical region (19 and 20) were excluded from the analysis. The mean segment value represented the myocardial wall motion score and 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake of each region. Assessment of LV dyssynchrony by phase analysis of GMS images Phase analysis of the GMS images of 22 patients in this study was performed in the Department of Radiology of Emory University School of Medicine by investigators (J.C. and E.V.G.) who were blinded to the patients’ electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and clinical data. Once GMS data were acquired, reconstructed, and reoriented, gated short-axis images were obtained and converted to gated polar maps. Because each pixel in the polar map represented the local maximum count (that is proportional to the wall thickness), a wall-thickening curve over the cardiac cycle was generated for each pixel of the polar map. Afterwards, phase distribution was obtained for the entire LV. The following two quantitative indexes were calculated from the phase analysis: (1) phase standard deviation, which is the standard deviation of the phase distribution; and (2) phase histogram bandwidth, which includes 95% of the elements in the phase distribution. This tool has been implemented in the Emory Cardiac Toolbox, and it is a totally automatic process [ 22 , 23 ]. Statistical analysis Data are expressed as means±standard deviation. The categorical and proportional data were analysed using the chi-squared test, the likelihood ratio test, or Fisher’s exact test. For comparison of parametric variables before and after CRT, the paired Student’s t test was used. The data were compared between groups using the unpaired t -test, and a stepwise logistic model was used to identify predictive parameters. The sensitivity and specificity of the EDV before therapy for predicting LVEF improvement after CRT was determined by receiver-operating characteristic curves. Statistical significance was defined at p <0.05.  Patients A group of 30 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic HF in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV, LVEF <35%, and left bundle-branch block (QRS ?120 ms) referred for implantation of a CRT device were prospectively included in the present study after providing written informed consent.

The sensitivity and specificity of the EDV before therapy for predicting LVEF improvement after CRT was determined by receiver-operating characteristic curves. Statistical significance was defined at p <0.05.  Results The baseline characteristics of the two groups of patients are shown in Table 1 . The medical treatment of both groups of patients was optimized. However, it was observed that a higher percentage of group 2 patients used digoxin (89%) compared with group 1 patients (50%, p =0.018). After CRT, there were no significant changes in medical treatment or in the patients’ weight ( Table 2 ) in either group. Effects of CRT on functional class and QRS width in accordance with changes in LVEF Three months after CRT, 12 patients (40%, group 1) showed an improvement in LVEF of ?5 points on 2-D echocardiography and 18 patients (60%, group 2) did not ( Fig. 2 ). Mean LVEF increased from 22±4% to 35±7% in group 1 and did not significantly change in group 2 (from 21±3% to 21±3%). After CRT, both groups showed an improvement in HF functional class ( p <0.001), and these changes were significantly different between groups ( p =0.005): nine group 1 patients (75%) were in functional class I and three (25%) were in functional class II, whereas 5 group 2 patients (28%) were in functional class I, six (33%) were in functional class II and 7 (39%) remained in functional class III. Both groups showed a significant reduction in QRS width, and this reduction was more significant in group 1 than in group 2 ( Table 2 ). Effects of CRT on LV volumes and regional wall motion After CRT, group 1 patients showed a significant reduction in EDV (from 276±94 ml to 183±87 ml, p <0.001) and in ESV (from 220±85 ml to 129±82 ml, p <0.001). The changes seen in LV volumes in group 2 patients were not significant (EDV changed from 477±168 ml to 456±161 ml, p =0.107, and ESV changed from 401±154 ml to 395±160 ml, p =0.759; Fig. 2 , Table 2 ). In group 1 patients the wall motion score showed statistically significant increase in the anterior, anteroseptal, inferoseptal and inferior regions, whereas in group 2 patients no increase was seen. Furthermore, in group 2 patients the wall motion score decreased in the anterolateral region ( Table 3 , Fig. 3 ). Effects of CRT on <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MIBI myocardial uptake After CRT, the total extension of the defect as shown by 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake at rest decreased from 14±5% to 7±5% in group 1 ( p =0.003) but did not show a significant change in group 2 (from 17±10% to 15±10%, p =0.249). Regional 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake increased significantly in the anterior, anteroseptal and inferoseptal LV walls in group 1 patients ( p <0.05). Group 2 patients also showed 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake increase in the anteroseptal, inferoseptal, and inferior LV walls and showed a decrease in 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake in the anterolateral wall ( p =0.003; Table 4 , Fig. 3 ). Figures 4 and 5 show the changes in myocardial 99mTc-MIBI uptake and motion (polar map) before and after CRT in one patient of each group. Effects of CRT on LV dyssynchrony evaluated by phase analysis of GMS images LV dyssynchrony indices by phase analysis of GMS images was performed in 10 group 1 patients and in 12 group 2 patients before and after CRT. The phase standard deviation declined significantly in group 1 patients (from 52°±24° to 24°±12°, p =0.016) and tended to decline in group 2 patients (from 62°±15° to 52°±22°, p =0.051). The phase histogram bandwidth decreased significantly in group 1 patients (from 163°±71° to 78°±42°, p =0.017) but the decrease was not significant in group 2 patients (from 215°±66° to 179°±87°, p =0.075). Predictors of improvement in LVEF after CRT By univariate analysis, EDV, ESV, anterior and inferior myocardial wall 99mTc-MIBI uptake variables were significantly different between the groups before CRT. The EDV and ESV were higher in group 2 than in group 1 (EDV 477±168 ml vs. 276±94 ml, p <0.001; ESV 401±154 ml vs. 220±85 ml, p <0.001, group 2 and group 1, respectively), whereas 99mTc-MIBI uptake in the anterior and inferior myocardial wall was lower in group 2 than in group 1 (anterior 60±10% vs. 67±7%, p =0.049; inferior 48±10% vs. 59±11%, p =0.001, group 2 and group 1, respectively). By stepwise logistic regression analysis, EDV was the only independent predictor of LVEF improvement after CRT ( p =0.011). The receiver-operating characteristic curve for prediction of LVEF increase after CRT showed the greatest area under the curve for EDV before CRT (area of 0.94, IC95% 0.85–1). The optimal cut-off point for EDV was 315 ml with 89% sensitivity and 92% specificity ( Fig. 6 ).  Results The baseline characteristics of the two groups of patients are shown in Table 1 . The medical treatment of both groups of patients was optimized. However, it was observed that a higher percentage of group 2 patients used digoxin (89%) compared with group 1 patients (50%, p =0.018). After CRT, there were no significant changes in medical treatment or in the patients’ weight ( Table 2 ) in either group.

The changes seen in LV volumes in group 2 patients were not significant (EDV changed from 477±168 ml to 456±161 ml, p =0.107, and ESV changed from 401±154 ml to 395±160 ml, p =0.759; Fig. 2 , Table 2 ). In group 1 patients the wall motion score showed statistically significant increase in the anterior, anteroseptal, inferoseptal and inferior regions, whereas in group 2 patients no increase was seen. Furthermore, in group 2 patients the wall motion score decreased in the anterolateral region ( Table 3 , Fig. 3 ). Effects of CRT on <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MIBI myocardial uptake After CRT, the total extension of the defect as shown by 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake at rest decreased from 14±5% to 7±5% in group 1 ( p =0.003) but did not show a significant change in group 2 (from 17±10% to 15±10%, p =0.249). Regional 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake increased significantly in the anterior, anteroseptal and inferoseptal LV walls in group 1 patients ( p <0.05). Group 2 patients also showed 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake increase in the anteroseptal, inferoseptal, and inferior LV walls and showed a decrease in 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake in the anterolateral wall ( p =0.003; Table 4 , Fig. 3 ). Figures 4 and 5 show the changes in myocardial 99mTc-MIBI uptake and motion (polar map) before and after CRT in one patient of each group. Effects of CRT on LV dyssynchrony evaluated by phase analysis of GMS images LV dyssynchrony indices by phase analysis of GMS images was performed in 10 group 1 patients and in 12 group 2 patients before and after CRT. The phase standard deviation declined significantly in group 1 patients (from 52°±24° to 24°±12°, p =0.016) and tended to decline in group 2 patients (from 62°±15° to 52°±22°, p =0.051). The phase histogram bandwidth decreased significantly in group 1 patients (from 163°±71° to 78°±42°, p =0.017) but the decrease was not significant in group 2 patients (from 215°±66° to 179°±87°, p =0.075). Predictors of improvement in LVEF after CRT By univariate analysis, EDV, ESV, anterior and inferior myocardial wall 99mTc-MIBI uptake variables were significantly different between the groups before CRT. The EDV and ESV were higher in group 2 than in group 1 (EDV 477±168 ml vs. 276±94 ml, p <0.001; ESV 401±154 ml vs. 220±85 ml, p <0.001, group 2 and group 1, respectively), whereas 99mTc-MIBI uptake in the anterior and inferior myocardial wall was lower in group 2 than in group 1 (anterior 60±10% vs. 67±7%, p =0.049; inferior 48±10% vs. 59±11%, p =0.001, group 2 and group 1, respectively). By stepwise logistic regression analysis, EDV was the only independent predictor of LVEF improvement after CRT ( p =0.011). The receiver-operating characteristic curve for prediction of LVEF increase after CRT showed the greatest area under the curve for EDV before CRT (area of 0.94, IC95% 0.85–1). The optimal cut-off point for EDV was 315 ml with 89% sensitivity and 92% specificity ( Fig. 6 ).

Both groups showed a significant reduction in QRS width, and this reduction was more significant in group 1 than in group 2 ( Table 2 ).

Mean LVEF increased from 22±4% to 35±7% in group 1 and did not significantly change in group 2 (from 21±3% to 21±3%). After CRT, both groups showed an improvement in HF functional class ( p <0.001), and these changes were significantly different between groups ( p =0.005): nine group 1 patients (75%) were in functional class I and three (25%) were in functional class II, whereas 5 group 2 patients (28%) were in functional class I, six (33%) were in functional class II and 7 (39%) remained in functional class III. Both groups showed a significant reduction in QRS width, and this reduction was more significant in group 1 than in group 2 ( Table 2 ).  Effects of CRT on LV volumes and regional wall motion After CRT, group 1 patients showed a significant reduction in EDV (from 276±94 ml to 183±87 ml, p <0.001) and in ESV (from 220±85 ml to 129±82 ml, p <0.001). The changes seen in LV volumes in group 2 patients were not significant (EDV changed from 477±168 ml to 456±161 ml, p =0.107, and ESV changed from 401±154 ml to 395±160 ml, p =0.759; Fig. 2 , Table 2 ). In group 1 patients the wall motion score showed statistically significant increase in the anterior, anteroseptal, inferoseptal and inferior regions, whereas in group 2 patients no increase was seen. Furthermore, in group 2 patients the wall motion score decreased in the anterolateral region ( Table 3 , Fig. 3 ).  Effects of CRT on LV volumes and regional wall motion After CRT, group 1 patients showed a significant reduction in EDV (from 276±94 ml to 183±87 ml, p <0.001) and in ESV (from 220±85 ml to 129±82 ml, p <0.001). The changes seen in LV volumes in group 2 patients were not significant (EDV changed from 477±168 ml to 456±161 ml, p =0.107, and ESV changed from 401±154 ml to 395±160 ml, p =0.759; Fig. 2 , Table 2 ). In group 1 patients the wall motion score showed statistically significant increase in the anterior, anteroseptal, inferoseptal and inferior regions, whereas in group 2 patients no increase was seen. Furthermore, in group 2 patients the wall motion score decreased in the anterolateral region ( Table 3 , Fig. 3 ).  Effects of CRT on <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MIBI myocardial uptake After CRT, the total extension of the defect as shown by 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake at rest decreased from 14±5% to 7±5% in group 1 ( p =0.003) but did not show a significant change in group 2 (from 17±10% to 15±10%, p =0.249). Regional 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake increased significantly in the anterior, anteroseptal and inferoseptal LV walls in group 1 patients ( p <0.05). Group 2 patients also showed 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake increase in the anteroseptal, inferoseptal, and inferior LV walls and showed a decrease in 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake in the anterolateral wall ( p =0.003; Table 4 , Fig. 3 ). Figures 4 and 5 show the changes in myocardial 99mTc-MIBI uptake and motion (polar map) before and after CRT in one patient of each group.

Effects of CRT on LV dyssynchrony evaluated by phase analysis of GMS images LV dyssynchrony indices by phase analysis of GMS images was performed in 10 group 1 patients and in 12 group 2 patients before and after CRT. The phase standard deviation declined significantly in group 1 patients (from 52°±24° to 24°±12°, p =0.016) and tended to decline in group 2 patients (from 62°±15° to 52°±22°, p =0.051). The phase histogram bandwidth decreased significantly in group 1 patients (from 163°±71° to 78°±42°, p =0.017) but the decrease was not significant in group 2 patients (from 215°±66° to 179°±87°, p =0.075).

Predictors of improvement in LVEF after CRT By univariate analysis, EDV, ESV, anterior and inferior myocardial wall 99mTc-MIBI uptake variables were significantly different between the groups before CRT. The EDV and ESV were higher in group 2 than in group 1 (EDV 477±168 ml vs. 276±94 ml, p <0.001; ESV 401±154 ml vs. 220±85 ml, p <0.001, group 2 and group 1, respectively), whereas 99mTc-MIBI uptake in the anterior and inferior myocardial wall was lower in group 2 than in group 1 (anterior 60±10% vs. 67±7%, p =0.049; inferior 48±10% vs. 59±11%, p =0.001, group 2 and group 1, respectively). By stepwise logistic regression analysis, EDV was the only independent predictor of LVEF improvement after CRT ( p =0.011). The receiver-operating characteristic curve for prediction of LVEF increase after CRT showed the greatest area under the curve for EDV before CRT (area of 0.94, IC95% 0.85–1). The optimal cut-off point for EDV was 315 ml with 89% sensitivity and 92% specificity ( Fig. 6 ).

Discussion The main results of this study show that (1) there was significant LV remodelling in group 1 patients demonstrated by an important decrease in LV diastolic and systolic volumes; (2) the probability of LVEF improvement and LV reverse remodelling after CRT was higher in patients who had lower LV volumes and more normal regional 99mTc-MIBI uptake, especially in the inferior myocardial wall before CRT; (3) independently of LVEF increase, LV remodelling and dyssynchrony improvement, CRT promoted significant increases in anteroseptal and inferoseptal myocardial wall 99mTc-MIBI uptake, and improved HF functional class in the majority of the patients. Moreover, GMS allowed direct LV dyssynchrony evaluation and follow-up by means of phase standard deviation and histogram bandwidth indices. LVEF significantly improved in 40% of patients, which is in accordance with the findings of other studies [ 10 , 11 ]. More importantly, since GMS is a tridimensional method, it was possible to discriminate the LV regions that recovered their function. CRT improved the anterior, anteroseptal, inferoseptal and inferior wall motion in group 1 patients but not in group 2 patients. Multivariate analysis showed that EDV obtained before CRT by GMS was an independent predictor of LVEF increase after CRT. Massive LV dilation is considered an independent contributor to poor outcome in patients with advanced HF [ 25 ]. Possibly, the more dilated hearts of group 2 patients represented a more advanced stage of the disease with no potential to increase their performance after therapy. Our results also show that the percentage of digoxin use was higher in group 2 patients than in group 1 patients, suggesting more severe HF. Recently, we have shown that patients with lower cardiac 123I-MIBG uptake, a marker of cardiac sympathetic activity, have a low probability of clinical improvement after CRT [ 15 ]. These findings reinforce the notion that to achieve measurable benefits from CRT, patients should be treated at an earlier stage of the disease. The EDV cut-off point found in this study could be used to refine the selection of patients for this therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the differences in regional myocardial 99mTc-MIBI uptake according to changes in LVEF after CRT. The benefit of CRT is greater in patients with smaller fibrotic regions, in those with nonischaemic cardiomyopathy, and if the paced zone does not involve fibrosis [ 26 , 27 ]. The quantitation of 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake defect size is a parameter of myocardial fibrosis [ 17 ]. Sciagrà et al. [ 26 ] have shown that the presence of severe rest defects on myocardial scintigraphy is associated with a nonsignificant improvement in LVEF or reduction in LV volumes after CRT. In this study, we also analysed the total extent and severity of the defect at rest, and we did not observe significant differences in this parameter before CRT between the groups. However, we found using univariate analysis that group 2 patients had lower 99mTc-MIBI uptake in the anterior and inferior walls than did group 1 patients. Thus, in patients with nonischaemic cardiomyopathy, the location of fibrosis seems to be more important than the total amount of myocardial scar burden, since the presence of fibrosis may prevent the electric stimuli passing properly through these walls. Myocardial perfusion impairment, mitochondrial dysfunction and specialized Purkinje cell derangement may reflect the progression of myocardial damage in chronic HF. A recent study [ 14 ] has demonstrated that CRT reverses regional and global molecular remodelling, generating more homogeneous activation stress kinesis and reducing apoptosis. Functional imaging methods that noninvasively assess cellular perfusion and integrity can provide information about the effects of CRT on myocyte performance. Some studies have shown that CRT improves myocardial tracer uptake in the septum and decreases uptake in the lateral wall, suggesting a reverse remodelling of regional myocardial functional status [ 28 – 30 ]. We observed that despite the lack of increase in LVEF after therapy group 2 patients had an increase in LV anteroseptal, inferoseptal and inferior wall 99mTc-MIBI uptake, and about 60% of them had improvement in functional class. Chiu et al. [ 18 ] showed that cellular 99mTc-MIBI uptake and retention are dependent on both mitochondrial and plasma membrane potentials. Matsuo et al. [ 31 ] showed that the myocardial washout rate of 99mTc-MIBI provides prognostic information in patients with congestive HF. Thus, it seems that the increase in myocardial 99mTc-MIBI uptake, as shown in this study, is indicative of improvement in cellular perfusion and mitochondrial function. These favourable cellular effects could explain why this therapy improved functional class even in patients who did not show LVEF increase and LV reverse remodelling. Study limitations The most significant limitation of this study was that we did not directly measure mitochondrial function, and for this reason we could not establish a direct correlation between myocardial 99mTc-MIBI uptake and mitochondrial function. But this measurement can be quite difficult in vivo and needs myocardial biopsy. The small number of patients studied limited the power of our results, and further studies are needed to confirm them. The myocardial 99mTc-MIBI uptake results before and after CRT could be partially due to a decreased septal wall thickness relative to other segments of the cardiac wall, leading to an apparent relative decrease in counts per unit volume (an artefactual decrease in counts due to a partial-volume effect). However, we observed that in group 2 patients no improvement occurred in any LV regional wall motion score after CRT. Nevertheless, myocardial 99mTc-MIBI uptake increased significantly in the anteroseptal, inferoseptal, and inferior walls. In group 1 patients, we also observed that the wall motion score improved in the inferior wall but no significant change occurred in 99mTc-MIBI uptake in this region ( Fig. 3 ). The lack of use of attenuation correction in the images may also have been a limitation of this study. Therefore, the myocardial 99mTc-MIBI measurement could be underestimated, especially in the inferior wall, in the larger LV, and in the more obese patients. But we emphasize that we used the same measurement method before and after CRT and the patients’ weight did not change significantly between before and after therapy. Therefore, the changes observed in 99mTc-MIBI myocardial uptake after CRT probably were not influenced by this factor. Conclusion LV volumes, regional 99mTc-MIBI uptake, and LV dyssynchrony phase analysis indices assessed by GMS may add information for the selection and follow-up of potential candidates for CRT. Our data show that the probability of an improvement in LVEF after CRT was higher in patients with lower EDV. Furthermore, because 99mTc-MIBI uptake depends on cellular perfusion and mitochondrial integrity, the monitoring of changes in myocardial 99mTc-MIBI uptake before and after CRT may improve our understanding of the importance of cellular derangement in defining the response to this therapy. Independently of LVEF increase, LV remodelling and dyssynchrony improvement, CRT promoted a significant increase in 99mTc-MIBI uptake in some LV myocardial regions. These favourable modifications may have been related to the clinical improvement observed in the majority of these patients.
