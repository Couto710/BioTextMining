Allosteric modulators of GPCRs: a novel approach for the treatment of CNS disorders Despite G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) being among the most fruitful targets for marketed drugs, intense discovery efforts for several GPCR subtypes have failed to deliver selective drug candidates. Historically, drug discovery programmes for GPCR ligands have been dominated by efforts to develop agonists and antagonists that act at orthosteric sites for endogenous ligands. However, in recent years, there have been tremendous advances in the discovery of novel ligands for GPCRs that act at allosteric sites to regulate receptor function. These compounds provide high selectivity, novel modes of efficacy and may lead to novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of multiple psychiatric and neurological human disorders.  Summary and conclusions Over the past decade major advances have been made in establishing allosteric modulators of GPCRs as a novel approach to regulating this important class of drug targets. These include PAMs, NAMs, neutral allosteric modulators and allosteric agonists, and highlight the tremendous potential for fine tuning cellular signalling processes in either a positive (for example, allosteric potentiator) or negative (for example, partial allosteric antagonist) direction. Potent and selective GPCR modulators have now been developed for each of the three major subfamilies of GPCRs. These have provided novel tools and drug leads for multiple receptors for which efforts aimed at discovery of orthosteric ligands had been unsuccessful. Multiple allosteric modulators of GPCRs have been developed for use in animal studies and have robust effects in animal models that predict efficacy in schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, Parkinson’s disease and other neurological and psychiatric disorders. This recent preclinical work, coupled with the launch of cinacalcet and maraviroc as the first marketed GPCR allosteric modulators, provide strong validation of the potential clinical utility of both GPCR PAMs and NAMs. The discovery and development of GPCR subtype-selective allosteric modulators is a relatively recent endeavour. The studies reported to date provide proof of concept that could fuel the discovery of highly selective ligands for other GPCRs that have been previously intractable, such as D1 dopamine receptors, other mAChR subtypes, receptors for various sphingolipids and other lipid mediators, and a range of peptide receptors. The major advances in discovery and characterization of novel GPCR modulators are providing fundamental new insights into the mechanisms of action, range of activities and keys to chemical optimization of these compounds as therapeutic agents. These advances are providing crucial information that will guide drug discovery efforts aimed at developing the next generation of therapeutic agents that target GPCR allosteric sites for the treatment of a range of CNs disorders as well as multiple peripheral indications.  Figures and Tables Figure 1 Modes of action of allosteric modulators a | Allosteric ligands bind to a topographically distinct site on a receptor to modulate orthosteric ligand affinity (red) and/or efficacy (blue). Some allosteric ligands can directly perturb signalling in their own right (green). b | Simulations show the effects on the binding (left) or function (right) of an orthosteric agonist mediated by three different allosteric potentiators: the first (red) enhances orthosteric agonist affinity only; the second (blue) enhances orthosteric agonist efficacy only; the third (green) modestly enhances both affinity and efficacy, and also displays allosteric agonism. Note the potential for differences in observed outcome depending on assay format and that the baseline is 50% specific binding.
