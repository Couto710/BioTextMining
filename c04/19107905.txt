Adiponectin and Type 2 Diabetes in Samoan Adults Objective Previous studies have established an association between adiponectin and type 2 diabetes. It is unclear whether adiponectin will be useful among Samoan Islanders, characterized by markedly elevated levels of obesity, in differentiating those at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Methods Cross-sectional, genetic epidemiology study of obesity in American Samoa and Samoa 2002–2003 ( n = 1,599). Logistic regression provided adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between adiponectin, diabetes, and prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose). Results There is a significant decreasing trend in the odds of diabetes and prediabetes across increasing quintiles of adiponectin with an OR of 2.8 (95% CI: 1.6, 5.0) and 2.9 (95% CI: 1.5, 5.7), respectively, in the lowest relative to the highest quintile of adiponectin ( P -for-trend = 0.004 and 0.001). Conclusions Adiponectin is an important correlate, independent of other risk factors, of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes among Samoan islanders and may help distinguish those at higher risk of developing this disease.  METHODS Participants Participants were ?18 years of age and took part in the Samoan Family Study of Overweight and Diabetes in 2002–2003 ( Dai et al., 2007 , 2008 ). Recruitment in American Samoa (2002) was based on random selection of individuals seen in the 1990–1994 cohort study in American Samoa, and the presence of at least two adult siblings alive and residing in American Samoa. Initial recruitment in Samoa (2003) was based on finding individuals who were members of American Samoa pedigrees. Later recruitment occurred in villages selected to represent geographic and socioeconomic diversity. Protocols for this study were approved by the Brown University and American Samoan Institutional Review Board, and the Government of Samoa, Ministry of Health, Health Research Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Measurements Stature and weight were measured with participants wearing light tropical clothing, without shoes and BMI was calculated. Polynesian BMI criteria for classifying overweight, BMI 26–31.9 kg/m2, and obesity, BMI ? 32 kg/m2, were used based on earlier body composition research ( Swinburn et al., 1999 ). Abdominal circumference was measured twice at the level of the umbilicus with a metal tape, and the average of the two measurements was taken. Serum was collected after a minimum 10-h fast in the field, and the following assays were completed: serum insulin using standard RIA kits from Diagnostic Products, serum glucose using an automatic analyzer, Beckman CX4, and serum adiponectin using RIA kits from Linco. HDL cholesterol was measured after precipitation of very low and low density lipoprotein with heparin-Mn2+ reagent ( Aberg et al., 2008 ). Sociodemographic, health, and nutrition information were obtained by interview including questions about previous diabetes diagnosis, duration, and current treatment. A material lifestyle score was calculated for each participant based upon a 10-point index of household possessions, including possession of a refrigerator and television. This index is a sensitive measure of socioeconomic status (SES) in modernizing societies because it includes the impact of migrant remittances on household income ( Ezeamama et al., 2006 ). Hours per week of physical activity included duration of physical activity in wage labor, recreational sports, farming, and fishing. All physical activities were coded for intensity (low, moderate, high) using CDC guidelines ( Keighley et al., 2007 ). Statistical analyses The total study sample consisted of 1,716 adults. Participants were excluded from the sample because of missing data, leaving a sample of 1,599 (251 with type 2 diabetes, 231 with prediabetes, and 1,117 with normal glycemia). Prediabetes or impaired fasting glucose was defined as 100? fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <126 with no self-reported treatment or diagnosis of diabetes. In the study sample, 40% of American Samoan adults <50 years of age and 18% ?50 years found to have a FPG level ?126 mg/dl did not have a prior diagnosis of diabetes. In Samoa, slightly less that 50% of adults ?50 years of age diagnosed with diabetes were unaware of their status ( Keighley et al., 2007 ). It is likely that many individuals with a prior diabetes diagnosis and new cases we detected had diabetes long before diagnosis. This trend is partially attributable to low SES and health literacy in this population leading to low levels of health care seeking ( Ezeamama et al., 2006 ). Therefore, we also examined the relationship between adiponectin and prediabetes as adiponectin likely affects diabetes risk early in the pathogenesis of this condition ( Cnop et al., 2003 ; Trujillo and Scherer, 2005 ). Descriptive analyses were performed using ANOVA and t -tests for continuous variables and ?2 tests for categorical variables. Adiponectin, insulin, and glucose were natural log transformed to improve normality. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs for the association between adiponectin, diabetes, and prediabetes with those with normal glycemia as the reference. Because of the family design of the study, a random effects term for household was included to account for clustering among individuals. Individuals were assigned a value for household based upon their residence at the time of the study. Adiponectin was divided into quintiles for use in regression models. Tests for trend across quintiles of adiponectin used the median value for each of the quintiles modeled as a continuous variable. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.1.

RESULTS The proportions of adults with diabetes, prediabetes, and normal glycemia are as follows: 11.3% (102/903, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.14), 14.9% (135/903, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.17), and 73.7% (666/903, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.77) in Samoa; and 21.5% (161/750, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.25), 13.9% (104/750, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.17), and 64.7% (485/750, 95% CI: 0.61, 0.68) in American Samoa. Diabetes risk factors stratified by glycemic status are shown in Table 1 . There were significant differences by glycemic group in age, BMI, fat, protein, and carbohydrate intake, moderate activity hours, HDL cholesterol, adiponectin, insulin, and glucose levels. Significant differences were noted between those with prediabetes and diabetes in hours of moderate physical activity ( P = 0.003), age ( P < 0.0001), percent calories from fat ( P = 0.002), and carbohydrate ( P = 0.004), insulin ( P = 0.0006), and glucose levels ( P < 0.0001). In the adjusted models ( Table 2 ), there was a significant decreasing trend in the odds of diabetes and prediabetes across increasing quintiles of adiponectin with ORs of 2.8 (95% CI: 1.6, 5.0) and 2.9 (95% CI: 1.5, 5.7), respectively, in the lowest relative to the highest quintile of adiponectin ( P -for-trend = 0.004 and 0.001). These results were consistent across age and sex strata (data not shown).

These results were consistent across age and sex strata (data not shown).  DISCUSSION This report establishes a significant cross-sectional relationship between low serum adiponectin and increased odds of diabetes and prediabetes in adults from throughout the Samoan islands. There was no appreciable change in this relationship after controlling for other risk factors for type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance, abdominal circumference, age, sex, physical activity, and SES). Although these risk factors likely partially mediate the effect of adiponectin on the diabetic state, our results support a direct and independent effect of adiponectin. Our results are consistent with previous studies among Pima Indians (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.92 high versus low adiponectin) ( Lindsay et al., 2002 ), Japanese Americans (Hazard ratio: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.01, 3.17 lowest versus highest tertile of adiponectin) ( Nakashima et al., 2006 ), and European populations (Relative risk: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.2, 0.7 fourth versus first quartile of adiponectin) that found low adiponectin levels to be related to the occurrence of type 2 diabetes. The consistency of the inverse relationship between adiponectin and type 2 diabetes across study populations with varying obesity and adiponectin levels is noteworthy. Adiponectin appears to be an important predictor early in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes even among Samoan islanders, characterized by high obesity levels and may help distinguish those at higher risk of developing this disease.
