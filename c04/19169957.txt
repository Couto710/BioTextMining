Cancer vaccines: current directions and perspectives in prostate cancer Numerous ongoing studies are investigating the use of cancer vaccines as a potential therapeutic modality for various tumor types. The efficacy of cancer vaccines has improved thanks to advances in the characterization of tumor-associated antigens, the development of better vaccine delivery systems, and the combination of vaccines with cytokines and other immunostimulants to enhance immune responses. Although cancer vaccines are being studied in many different tumor types, several characteristics of prostate cancer make it an ideal target for immunotherapy. Prostate cancerâ€™s relative indolence allows sufficient time to generate immune responses, which usually take weeks or months to mount. In addition, prostate cancer-associated antigens direct the immune response to prostate cancer cells, thus sparing normal tissue. This review focuses on promising new approaches for combining vaccines with other therapeutic strategies, as well as novel perspectives in the treatment of prostate cancer.  Conclusion Vaccine strategies for the treatment of prostate cancer are under active investigation using a wide variety of approaches including whole tumor cell vaccines, DC approaches, and vector-driven delivery of TAAs. Preclinical and clinical results of studies employing these various vaccine approaches have demonstrated immunologic responses that, in some instances, correlate with clinical activity of these vaccines. Larger clinical studies are needed to validate these findings. Novel vaccine strategies are also being implemented, including the addition of costimulatory molecules to help activate and proliferate T-cell responses, and combination therapies with cytokines, antibodies, hormones, and chemotherapy that may help reduce regulatory Tregs and initiate an antigen cascade that could allow additional tumor antigens to be targeted by the immune system.
