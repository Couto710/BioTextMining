Cancer Risk Assessment for the Primary Care Physician Summary Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Cancer risk assessment can be divided into two major categories: assessment of familial or genetic risk and assessment of environmental factors that may be causally related to cancer. Identification of individuals with a suspected heritable cancer syndrome can lead to additional evaluation and to interventions that can substantially decrease cancer risk. Special attention should also be paid to potentially modifiable cancer risk factors in the course of advising primary care patients regarding a healthy lifestyle. Clinical guidelines targeting both genetic and modifiable cancer risk factors are available, and can facilitate applying these health care principles in the primary care setting.  Summary and Conclusions Primary care physicians are uniquely situated to identify individuals at increased genetic or environmental risk of cancer. The early identification of a suspected heritable cancer syndrome can lead to additional evaluation and to interventions that can substantially decrease cancer risk. Web-based tools for collecting and summarizing family history information and for predicting individual risks of certain cancers and familial syndromes are easily accessible, and are available for use by the primary care physician. Individuals with a high likelihood of having an inherited syndrome should be seriously considered for referral to a cancer genetics professional for further work-up and treatment, including genetic testing and risk reduction strategies. Special attention should also be paid to potentially modifiable cancer risk factors in the course of advising primary care patients regarding a healthy lifestyle. The fact that certain modifiable behaviors are associated with increased risk not only of cancers but also of other chronic disease creates an opportunity for early intervention. Clinical guidelines targeting modifiable cancer risk factors are available, and can facilitate applying these health care principles in the primary care setting.  Tables Table 1 Screening Recommendations for Individuals with a Family History of Selected Cancers Cancer Risk Group Screening Recommendation Breast Cancer ( 6 , 7 ) Average Risk Annual screening mammography starting at age 40; Clinical breast exam (CBE) q3yrs at age 20-39 then annually starting at age 40; Breast self exam (BSE) starting at age 20 Greater than 20% lifetime risk according to family history based model All of the above PLUS Annual screening MRI Personal or family history of HBOC or other genetic syndrome known to increase breast cancer risk Mammography beginning at age 25 OR 10 years prior to youngest age at diagnosis in family (whichever is sooner); Annual screening MRI; Annual CBE and BSE History of radiation to the chest wall (i.e., for Hodgkin Lymphoma) As above but beginning screening at age 40 or 8-10 yrs after radiation treatment (whichever is sooner) Colon Cancer ( 8 ) Average Risk Begin screening at age 50 years with colonoscopy (preferred), CT (virtual) colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, FOBT, or double contrast barium enema; identified polyps should be removed Individuals found to have polyps on screening <2 polyps, <1cm: repeat colonoscopy every 5 years Advanced or multiple adenomas: repeat exam within 3 years >10 adenomas: consider genetic syndrome Personal history of endometrial or ovarian cancer at age <60 Begin colonoscopy at age 40; repeat at least every 5 years (sooner if abnormal findings) Inflammatory bowel disease Begin colonoscopy 8-10 years after onset of symptoms; repeat every 1-2 years One or more first-degree relative with colon cancer; two or more second-degree relatives with colon cancer Consider genetics evaluation; begin screening at age 40; screen every 1-5 yrs depending on magnitude of family history Known HNPCC Begin screening at age 20-25 or 10 years prior to youngest diagnosis in family; screen every 1-2 yrs; consider colectomy if not amenable to endoscopic polypectomies; consider prophylactic hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy Known FAP Proctocolectomy or colectomy; annual sigmoidoscopy if retained rectum Prostate Cancer ( 9 , 10 ) Average risk Annual prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and digital rectal exam (DRE) should be offered to men with at least a 10-year life expectancy, beginning at age 50 African-American men or men with one or more first degree relatives diagnosed at age<65 Offer annual screening beginning at age 45 Men with multiple first degree relatives affected at an early age Could offer screening beginning at age 40; if first test is normal may not need to screen annually until age 45 Melanoma ( 11 ) Average risk Currently no evidence to suggest benefit for routine screening Family or personal history of melanoma Head-to-toe skin examination every 6-12 months starting at age 10; Consider clinical photographs or epiluminescence microscopy; Encourage monthly skin self-examination; Excise of any suspicious or changing pigmented lesions; Education regarding sunburn avoidance and characteristics of suspicious lesions Table 2 Selected Familial Cancer Syndromes, Responsible Genes and Clinical Manifestations ( 12 ) Syndrome Gene Clinical Manifestations Hereditary Breast Ovary Syndrome BRCA1, BRCA2 Early-onset female breast cancer, male breast cancer (female and male); ovarian and fallopian tube cancer; primary peritoneal carcinoma, prostate ( BRCA2 ) and pancreatic cancers Li-Fraumeni p53 Early-onset cancers (50% by age 30) including breast cancer, sarcoma, brain cancers, leukemia, adrenal cortical carcinoma HNPCC MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 PMS1 PMS2 MSH3 Cancers : Early-onset colorectal cancer; endometrial, ovarian, gastric cancer; biliary, renal pelvis, small bowel, brain cancers Other : adenomatous polyps FAP APC Cancers : Early-onset colorectal cancer; duodenal and pancreatic cancer; brain tumors; Other : colon, duodenal and gastric polyps; desmoid tumors Hereditary Melanoma CKDN2A, CDK4 Melanoma (early-onset and multiple); pancreatic cancer; possible association with astrocytoma and other neural-derived tumors; dysplastic nevi Cowden Syndrome PTEN Cancers : Breast cancer, thyroid cancer (usually follicular), possibly endometrial cancer Other : Facial trichilemmomas, hyperkeratotic lesions of the oral mucosa, face and limbs, hamartomatous polyps Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome STK11 Cancers : Breast cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, benign and malignant ovarian tumors (especially granulosa cell tumors), and possibly cervical and testicular cancer Other : Pigmented spots on the lips and buccal mucosa, multiple gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps Table 3 Recommendations for annual breast MRI screening ( 16 ) Risk Group Recommendation Level of Evidence BRCA mutation carrier Recommend annual MRI screening as an adjunct to mammography Based on non-randomized screening trials and observational studies First-degree relative of BRCA mutation carrier Lifetime risk of breast cancer ?20% as defined by family-history based model History of radiation to chest wall between age 10 â€“ 30 years Recommend annual MRI screening as an adjunct to mammography Based on expert consensus opinion Li-Fraumeni syndrome and first-degree relatives Cowden and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvulcaba syndromes and first-degree relatives Lifetime risk of breast cancer 15-20% as defined by family-history based model Insufficient evidence to recommend for or against annual MRI as adjunct to mammography; decision should be made on individual basis Insufficient evidence to make recommendation Pre-maligant breast lesion (lobular carcinoma in situ, atypical lobular hyperplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia) Dense breasts on mammography Personal history of invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ Women at <15% lifetime risk Recommend against annual MRI screening Based on expert consensus opinion
