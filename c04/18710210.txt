Synthesis of Novel ?-Lactone Inhibitors of Fatty Acid Synthase Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is necessary for growth and survival of tumor cells and is a promising drug target for oncology. Here, we report on the syntheses and activity of novel inhibitors of the thioesterase domain of FAS. Using the structure of orlistat as a starting point, which contains a ?-lactone as the central pharmacophore, 28 novel congeners were synthesized and examined. Structural features such as the length of the ?- and ?-alkyl chains, their chemical composition, and amino ester substitutions were altered and the resulting compounds explored for inhibitory activity toward the thioesterase domain of FAS. Nineteen congeners show improved potency for FAS in biochemical assays relative to orlistat. Three of that subset, including the natural product valilactone, also display an increased potency in inducing tumor cell death and improved solubility compared to orlistat. These findings support the idea that an orlistat congener can be optimized for use in a preclinical drug design and for clinical drug development.  Introduction Most human carcinomas, including those of the breast and prostate, overexpress fatty acid synthase (FAS a ), the sole enzyme responsible for de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids. 1 – 6 In the vast majority of cases, FAS is required for tumor cell survival and it also seems to play a role in conferring chemoresistance. 7 , 8 In contrast, most normal cells utilize dietary fats and therefore FAS is not required for survival. Consequently, FAS is a promising drug target for the treatment of human carcinomas. Orlistat is a pancreatic lipase inhibitor that is currently marketed for the treatment of obesity. In the gut, orlistat forms a covalent, but reversible, bond with the active site serine residue of pancreatic lipases, rendering them unable to hydrolyze dietary fat into free fatty acids and thereby reducing the absorption of dietary fat. 9 Previously, we showed that orlistat is also a potent inhibitor of the thioesterase activity of FAS and that it has antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. 10 The three-dimensional structure of orlistat bound to FAS shows that the compound forms a covalent adduct with the enzyme's active site serine, the same mechanism by which it inhibits pancreatic lipase. 11 Despite its ability to inhibit FAS and elicit tumor cell death, there are a number of challenges that prevent the deployment of orlistat as an antitumor drug: it has poor solubility and bioavailability and it lacks sufficient potency. Here we sought to take the first step toward the synthesis of an orlistat derivative suitable for use as an antitumor drug. The specific objectives of the present study were to (1) synthesize derivatives of orlistat with increased solubility, (2) determine the structural alterations that can be made to orlist at without loss of activity toward FAS, and (3) identify orlistat derivatives with increased potency toward FAS and increased cytotoxicity toward tumor cells. Twenty-eight novel congeners of orlistat were synthesized, most having increased solubility and inhibitory activity compared to orlistat. The ?- and ?-side chains extending from the ?-lactone were shown to be amenable to optimization, and alkenyl bonds can be incorporated into their structure without loss of activity. The amino ester can be changed without substantial loss of activity toward FAS. Reversal of chirality at C? and C? from S to R is tolerated, but compounds with R -C? chirality had substantially reduced activity. The results of the study reveal several new FAS inhibitors that are more suitable for preclinical drug development and also provide the foundation for a more detailed structure-based drug design centered on the ?-lactone pharmacophore.  Results and Discussion Synthesis of Orlistat Congeners Twenty-eight congeners of orlistat were synthesized to identify the structural components important for activity toward FAS ( Table 1 ). Four structural features of orlistat were altered in the test set: the ?- and ?-side chains, the amino ester, and chirality ( Figure 1 ). The described ?-lactones were synthesized employing the tandem Mukaiyama aldol-lactonization (TMAL) process previously developed in our group as the key step. 12 Previously we reported general strategies for the synthesis of orlistat derivatives employing the TMAL process in conjunction with coupling reactions that enable facile modification of both the ?- and ?-side chain including cuprate addition, simple alkylation of ethylacetoacetate for subsequent Noyori reduction, and an olefin metathesis/hydrogenation sequence. 13 These methods were also employed to prepare the derivatives studied herein. The TMAL process employs readily available thiopyridyl ketene acetals 3 and optically active aldehydes 8 and 12 . A series of thiopyridyl ketene acetals 3 were obtained according to previously reported methods involving generation of thiopyridyl esters 2 from the corresponding acid chlorides 1 and an enolization/silylation sequence ( Scheme 1 ). One route studied for the preparation of optically active ?-hydroxy aldehydes 8 made use of the chiral pool and involved cuprate addition to a common tosylate 6 derived from malic acid to install the ?-chain, which would enable its facile variation by appropriate choice of cuprate reagent ( Scheme 2 ). Thus, ( S )-malic acid was converted to tosylate ester 6 in a four-step sequence by following literature procedures (the synthesis of aldehyde 8a was described previously; see supporting documentation in ref 13 ). After some experimentation, suitable cuprate conditions were identified and the addition of the octyl Gilman reagent gave ester 7 in 78% yield. However, this process was not readily extended to other cuprates, so an alternative route to optically active aldehydes was studied (vide infra, Scheme 3 ). Following ester half-reduction, aldehyde 8a could be obtained in 86% yield. In an alternative route to optically active aldehydes 8 , simple alkylation of ethylacetoacetate was employed to provide several ?-ketoesters 10 and subsequent Noyori reduction, alcohol protection, and ester half-reduction provided aldehydes 8b – g . This enabled variation of the ?-chain of orlistat derivatives in a lengthier but high-yielding route ( Scheme 3 ). Treatment of various aldehydes 8 in a dichloromethane slurry of freshly fused ZnCl2 and thioketeneacetals 3 delivered the desired ?-lactones as mixtures of anti/syn diastereomers (7–9:1, dr) with complete selectivity for the trans -?-lactone. The ?-lactones were directly desilylated to afford the more readily separable ?-hydroxy ?-lactones 13 and 14 ( Scheme 4 ). The trans relative stereochemistry of the ?-lactone core was verified by analysis of coupling constants ( J Ha,Hb ~ 4.0 Hz) as described previously, whereas the relative stereochemistry of the major diastereomers with respect to the ?-stereocenter (C5) is consistent with Evans' model for additions to ?-silyloxy aldehydes as previously observed for these TMAL reactions. 14 Further verification came following completion of the synthesis of orlistat and valilactone and comparison to literature data (vide infra). To obtain a cis -?-lactone to determine the effect of ?-lactone relative stereochemistry on FAS inhibition, we employed our stereocomplimentary approach to ?-lactones, which employs SnCl4 as Lewis acid for the aldol-lactonization process. 15 Reaction of aldehyde 8f and ketene acetal 3d under these conditions gave a mixture of diastereomeric cis -?-lactones from which the major ?-lactone cis - 13 could be isolated. To obtain the required syn relative stereochemistry with respect to the ?- and ?-stereocenters as found in orlistat, the major diastereomeric hydroxy-?-lactones 13 , possessing the 6 R configuration, were subjected to Mitsunobu conditions to invert this stereocenter ( Scheme 5 ). This was accomplished with N -formyl amino acids and proceeded with the expected inversion of configuration, providing the 3 S ,4 S ,6 S -diastereomers 15 . To probe the effect of stereochemistry on FASTE inhibition, the minor 3 R ,4 R -diastereomers 14 obtained in the TMAL process were also converted to the 3 R ,4 R ,6 R -diastereomers 16 via the Mitsunobu reaction. In addition, retention of stereochemistry was possible by simple acylation of ?-lactones 13 with N -formyl amino acids to provide 3 S ,4 S ,6 R -diastereomers 17 in high yield. Finally, we also studied olefin cross metathesis as a possible tactic for modification of the ?-side chain from olefin precursors 18 involving two routes that differ only in reaction order, olefin metathesis, and introduction of the ?-amino ester moiety (methods A and B, Scheme 6 ). In one example, cross-metathesis with excess n -nonene in the presence of the first generation Grubb's catalyst gave low conversion (20% yield, unoptimized) of intermediate 20a (~4:1 E/Z ). 16 Subsequent hydrogenation of the derived olefinic derivatives under standard conditions afforded saturated ?-alkyl substituted derivatives 22 in nearly quantitative yield. This overall process provides an expedient route to modify the ?-side chain of orlistat. However, while this strategy successfully provided olefinic orlistat derivatives 21a – c (~4:1 E/Z with exception of 21c , which gave exclusively E ), generally, this route suffered from low conversion in the olefin metathesis step. Effect of Novel ?-Lactones on the Thioesterase Activity of FAS The thioesterase domain of FAS cleaves palmitate from the acyl carrier protein once its synthesis is complete. 17 Compounds were compared for their ability to inhibit the activity of the recombinant thioesterase using methods we have previously described. 18 , 19 Four structural components of the orlistat molecule were modified to test for effect on potency: the ?- and ?-side chains, the amino ester, and both relative and absolute stereochemistry ( Figure 1 ). The results of this analysis are summarized below: (i) Modifications to the ?-Chain In general, the inhibitory activity toward FAS is tolerant to changes in the length of the ?-chain. An ?-chain of just two carbons appears to be sufficient for good potency. Compounds 17a ( Table 2 , entry 2), 15f , and 17b ( Table 3 , entries 14 and 18, respectively) all have ?-chains less than the six carbons found in orlistat, and each has an IC50 equal to or less than that of orlistat. In fact, 17a , with an ethyl ?-chain, has an IC50 of 0.23 ?M, which is greater than 6-fold more potent than orlistat (IC50) 1.35 ?M). The reduction of the ?-chain to a methyl group, however, generally resulted in reduced potency. Compound 15e ( Table 4 , entry 7), which has the same structure as orlistat with the exception of having a methyl group in the ?-chain position, is approximately 8-fold less potent than orlistat. We have also observed that ebelactone B, which contains an ethyl ?-chain, is roughly 10 times more potent than ebelactone A, which contains a methyl ?-chain 20 (data not shown). Altogether these data establish that an ?-chain of just two carbons is sufficient for retention of good potency toward FAS. This observation is consistent with the recent finding from the crystal structure of orlistat bound to the FAS thioesterase which shows the ?-chain packs against the histidine residue of the catalytic triad. 11 On the basis of this structure, an ethyl moiety is expected to maintain such packing where a methyl group would be insufficient to extend to this histidine. (ii) Modifications to the ?-Chain Optimization of the ?-chain would seem to present a greater challenge because it binds within the putative palmitate binding pocket of the FAS thioesterase, helping to properly position the ?-lactone in the vicinity of the catalytic triad. 11 , 21 Therefore, truncation or other alteration of the ?-chain could lead to decreased potency if the conjugate bond cannot be formed. In a direct head-to-head comparison, the reduction of the ?-chain from 11 carbons ( 17c , Table 4 , entry 2) to just four carbons ( 23b , Table 3 , entry 2) resulted in a 15-fold increase in potency against FASTE in the biochemical assay, suggesting that the full length ?-chain is not necessary to position the ?-lactone at the catalytic triad. Even though they have additional structural changes, compounds 17d and 15f ( Table 3 , entries 12 and 14, respectively) also have ?-chains of reduced length and have increased potency compared to orlistat, providing further support that the full length chain is not necessary for activity. Other alterations to the ?-chain were also well-tolerated. The incorporation of a single alkenyl bond into the ?-chain ( 21a , Table 3 , entry 3) increased the potency of the compound 10-fold compared to orlistat. Several other olefinic compounds showed good potency toward FASTE, i.e., 15j ( Table 2 , entry 3), 21a – c ( Table 3 , entries 3, 8, and 10, respectively), and 15k ( Table 3 , entry 15) even though they were not part of direct head-to-head comparisons. Even the placement of an alkene at the terminal position of the ?-chain is tolerated as in compounds 15i ( Table 3 , entry 17) and 17f ( Table 3 , entry 11). A small set of compounds were synthesized with ?-chains other than simple hydrocarbons. Two of these compounds, 17e and 21c ( Table 3 , entries 7 and 10, respectively), were at least as active as orlistat in the biochemical assay, providing additional support for the idea that significant structural variability within the ?-chain can be accommodated by FASTE. (iii) Modifications to the Amino Ester Side Chain Orlistat contains an N -formyl- l -leucine moiety branching from the ? carbon (C6) of the lactone. Interactions between the enzyme and the amino ester may contribute to positioning orlistat at the active site. 11 Interestingly, the substitution of glycine for leucine at this position ( 15g , Table 3 , entry 16) had little effect on potency toward the FAS thioesterase. Results from other head-to-head comparisons of compounds with long ?-chains, i.e., 15b ( Table 3 , entry 5) versus 15c ( Table 3 , entry 6), were similar, indicating such substitutions are tolerated but provide no significant enhancement in potency by themselves. Importantly, though, in compounds with much shorter ?-chains that contain an alkenyl bond, substitution of the amino ester yielded a greater than 10-fold increase in potency as with 15i ( Table 3 , entry 17) versus 15h ( Table 4 , entry 8). Overall, 12 of the congeners we present here contain an N -formyl-glycine moiety that lends greater conformational flexibility than the N -formyl-leucine moiety and significantly decreases the compounds' overall hydrophobicity. Nine of these compounds had significantly improved inhibitory activity toward FASTE compared to orlistat. A small set of congeners (8) containing valine, phenylalanine, and histidine at the amino ester position were also synthesized and tested. These compounds also exhibited good potency toward the enzyme, suggesting a wide range of substitutions at this position are accommodated by the enzyme. (iv) Modifications in Chirality Several compounds (11) with differing relative and absolute stereochemistry at C?, C?, and/or C? were also synthesized and tested. While no head-to-head comparisons were made, initial indications suggest that stereochemical changes at C? ( R versus S ) abrogates inhibitory activity toward the FASTE such as with compounds 16a ( Table 4 , entry 6; IC50) 9.74 ?M) and 16b ( Table 4 , entry 9; IC50) 45.11 ?M). However, changes to chirality at C? appear to be tolerated, i.e., 17i ( Table 3 , entry 4; IC50) 0.18 ?M), as long as the S -configuration is retained at the ?-chain. Somewhat surprisingly, inverted stereochemistry at C?, the carbon from which the amino ester side chain branches off the main ?-chain, was also tolerated. In fact, compound 17a ( Table 2 , entry 2), with increased potency both toward FASTE and in cell-based assays, has inverted stereochemistry at C?. The vast majority of compounds with this inverted stereochemistry contained an N -formyl-glycine moiety that allows for greater conformational flexibility; however, we acknowledge the possibility of an alternate binding mode to the enzyme. Summary of All Orlistat Derivatives Synthesized In Table 1 , we summarize all orlistat derivatives prepared in this study with yields and diastereoselectivity of the key TMAL reaction process as well as yields for subsequent amino ester introduction via Mitsunobu or acylation chemistry. Effect of Compounds on Tumor Cell Apoptosis Each compound was also tested in MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells and Hs58.Fs foreskin fibroblasts to distinguish mechanism-based cell death elicited by inhibition of FAS from general cytotoxicity. To establish the degree to which each cell type depends on FAS for survival, we treated them with siRNA targeting FAS or with 25 ?M orlistat ( Figure 2 ). Both treatments induced death in the cancer cells but had only minimal effect on the fibroblasts. Importantly, the absolute level of apoptosis was essentially equivalent in both cell lines when they were treated with staurosporine, a compound known to induce apoptosis via an unrelated cAMP-mediated mechanism 22 (data not shown). These results establish that the cancer cells are dependent on FAS for survival but the fibroblasts are not. Three compounds ( 17a , 15j , and valilactone) were identified that had increased potency toward the thioesterase of FAS and in cell-based assays and that showed selective toxicity to the cancer cells compared to fibroblasts ( Table 2 ). The enhanced potency of this subset of compounds toward cells could be due to their increased affinity for the thioesterase domain, their enhanced aqueous solubility (cLogP values of less than 5 vs 8.6 for orlistat), or some combination of both. One other compound, 15g ( Table 3 , entry 16) had better potency than orlistat in the cell-based assays, even though its performance against the recombinant thioesterase was not significantly different from orlistat. The increase in cellular potency of this compound is probably due to a single structural variation, the substitution of a glycine at the amino ester position, which makes the compound less hydrophobic and reduces its cLogP. The remainder of the compounds either had a reduction in potency toward tumor cells or lost selectivity for tumor cells over the fibroblasts. Most of the compounds having good potency toward the recombinant thioesterase exhibited an IC50 in tumor cells greater than that of orlistat. There are two possibilities to explain this observation. First, it is conceivable that the FAS holoenzyme, in the context of the cellular environment, displays a thioesterase with a catalytic cleft that is structurally distinct from that of the recombinant thioesterase. Second, and probably more likely, is the possibility that these compounds simply have reduced ability to traverse the plasma membrane. Some of the compounds also lost selectivity for tumor cells over fibroblasts, which may be indicative of the reactivity of these compounds for other enzymes, especially other serine hydrolases that may be important for survival of all cells.  Synthesis of Orlistat Congeners Twenty-eight congeners of orlistat were synthesized to identify the structural components important for activity toward FAS ( Table 1 ). Four structural features of orlistat were altered in the test set: the ?- and ?-side chains, the amino ester, and chirality ( Figure 1 ). The described ?-lactones were synthesized employing the tandem Mukaiyama aldol-lactonization (TMAL) process previously developed in our group as the key step. 12 Previously we reported general strategies for the synthesis of orlistat derivatives employing the TMAL process in conjunction with coupling reactions that enable facile modification of both the ?- and ?-side chain including cuprate addition, simple alkylation of ethylacetoacetate for subsequent Noyori reduction, and an olefin metathesis/hydrogenation sequence. 13 These methods were also employed to prepare the derivatives studied herein. The TMAL process employs readily available thiopyridyl ketene acetals 3 and optically active aldehydes 8 and 12 . A series of thiopyridyl ketene acetals 3 were obtained according to previously reported methods involving generation of thiopyridyl esters 2 from the corresponding acid chlorides 1 and an enolization/silylation sequence ( Scheme 1 ). One route studied for the preparation of optically active ?-hydroxy aldehydes 8 made use of the chiral pool and involved cuprate addition to a common tosylate 6 derived from malic acid to install the ?-chain, which would enable its facile variation by appropriate choice of cuprate reagent ( Scheme 2 ). Thus, ( S )-malic acid was converted to tosylate ester 6 in a four-step sequence by following literature procedures (the synthesis of aldehyde 8a was described previously; see supporting documentation in ref 13 ). After some experimentation, suitable cuprate conditions were identified and the addition of the octyl Gilman reagent gave ester 7 in 78% yield. However, this process was not readily extended to other cuprates, so an alternative route to optically active aldehydes was studied (vide infra, Scheme 3 ). Following ester half-reduction, aldehyde 8a could be obtained in 86% yield. In an alternative route to optically active aldehydes 8 , simple alkylation of ethylacetoacetate was employed to provide several ?-ketoesters 10 and subsequent Noyori reduction, alcohol protection, and ester half-reduction provided aldehydes 8b – g . This enabled variation of the ?-chain of orlistat derivatives in a lengthier but high-yielding route ( Scheme 3 ). Treatment of various aldehydes 8 in a dichloromethane slurry of freshly fused ZnCl2 and thioketeneacetals 3 delivered the desired ?-lactones as mixtures of anti/syn diastereomers (7–9:1, dr) with complete selectivity for the trans -?-lactone. The ?-lactones were directly desilylated to afford the more readily separable ?-hydroxy ?-lactones 13 and 14 ( Scheme 4 ). The trans relative stereochemistry of the ?-lactone core was verified by analysis of coupling constants ( J Ha,Hb ~ 4.0 Hz) as described previously, whereas the relative stereochemistry of the major diastereomers with respect to the ?-stereocenter (C5) is consistent with Evans' model for additions to ?-silyloxy aldehydes as previously observed for these TMAL reactions. 14 Further verification came following completion of the synthesis of orlistat and valilactone and comparison to literature data (vide infra). To obtain a cis -?-lactone to determine the effect of ?-lactone relative stereochemistry on FAS inhibition, we employed our stereocomplimentary approach to ?-lactones, which employs SnCl4 as Lewis acid for the aldol-lactonization process. 15 Reaction of aldehyde 8f and ketene acetal 3d under these conditions gave a mixture of diastereomeric cis -?-lactones from which the major ?-lactone cis - 13 could be isolated. To obtain the required syn relative stereochemistry with respect to the ?- and ?-stereocenters as found in orlistat, the major diastereomeric hydroxy-?-lactones 13 , possessing the 6 R configuration, were subjected to Mitsunobu conditions to invert this stereocenter ( Scheme 5 ). This was accomplished with N -formyl amino acids and proceeded with the expected inversion of configuration, providing the 3 S ,4 S ,6 S -diastereomers 15 . To probe the effect of stereochemistry on FASTE inhibition, the minor 3 R ,4 R -diastereomers 14 obtained in the TMAL process were also converted to the 3 R ,4 R ,6 R -diastereomers 16 via the Mitsunobu reaction. In addition, retention of stereochemistry was possible by simple acylation of ?-lactones 13 with N -formyl amino acids to provide 3 S ,4 S ,6 R -diastereomers 17 in high yield. Finally, we also studied olefin cross metathesis as a possible tactic for modification of the ?-side chain from olefin precursors 18 involving two routes that differ only in reaction order, olefin metathesis, and introduction of the ?-amino ester moiety (methods A and B, Scheme 6 ). In one example, cross-metathesis with excess n -nonene in the presence of the first generation Grubb's catalyst gave low conversion (20% yield, unoptimized) of intermediate 20a (~4:1 E/Z ). 16 Subsequent hydrogenation of the derived olefinic derivatives under standard conditions afforded saturated ?-alkyl substituted derivatives 22 in nearly quantitative yield. This overall process provides an expedient route to modify the ?-side chain of orlistat. However, while this strategy successfully provided olefinic orlistat derivatives 21a – c (~4:1 E/Z with exception of 21c , which gave exclusively E ), generally, this route suffered from low conversion in the olefin metathesis step.  Effect of Novel ?-Lactones on the Thioesterase Activity of FAS The thioesterase domain of FAS cleaves palmitate from the acyl carrier protein once its synthesis is complete. 17 Compounds were compared for their ability to inhibit the activity of the recombinant thioesterase using methods we have previously described. 18 , 19 Four structural components of the orlistat molecule were modified to test for effect on potency: the ?- and ?-side chains, the amino ester, and both relative and absolute stereochemistry ( Figure 1 ). The results of this analysis are summarized below: (i) Modifications to the ?-Chain In general, the inhibitory activity toward FAS is tolerant to changes in the length of the ?-chain. An ?-chain of just two carbons appears to be sufficient for good potency. Compounds 17a ( Table 2 , entry 2), 15f , and 17b ( Table 3 , entries 14 and 18, respectively) all have ?-chains less than the six carbons found in orlistat, and each has an IC50 equal to or less than that of orlistat. In fact, 17a , with an ethyl ?-chain, has an IC50 of 0.23 ?M, which is greater than 6-fold more potent than orlistat (IC50) 1.35 ?M). The reduction of the ?-chain to a methyl group, however, generally resulted in reduced potency. Compound 15e ( Table 4 , entry 7), which has the same structure as orlistat with the exception of having a methyl group in the ?-chain position, is approximately 8-fold less potent than orlistat. We have also observed that ebelactone B, which contains an ethyl ?-chain, is roughly 10 times more potent than ebelactone A, which contains a methyl ?-chain 20 (data not shown). Altogether these data establish that an ?-chain of just two carbons is sufficient for retention of good potency toward FAS. This observation is consistent with the recent finding from the crystal structure of orlistat bound to the FAS thioesterase which shows the ?-chain packs against the histidine residue of the catalytic triad. 11 On the basis of this structure, an ethyl moiety is expected to maintain such packing where a methyl group would be insufficient to extend to this histidine. (ii) Modifications to the ?-Chain Optimization of the ?-chain would seem to present a greater challenge because it binds within the putative palmitate binding pocket of the FAS thioesterase, helping to properly position the ?-lactone in the vicinity of the catalytic triad. 11 , 21 Therefore, truncation or other alteration of the ?-chain could lead to decreased potency if the conjugate bond cannot be formed. In a direct head-to-head comparison, the reduction of the ?-chain from 11 carbons ( 17c , Table 4 , entry 2) to just four carbons ( 23b , Table 3 , entry 2) resulted in a 15-fold increase in potency against FASTE in the biochemical assay, suggesting that the full length ?-chain is not necessary to position the ?-lactone at the catalytic triad. Even though they have additional structural changes, compounds 17d and 15f ( Table 3 , entries 12 and 14, respectively) also have ?-chains of reduced length and have increased potency compared to orlistat, providing further support that the full length chain is not necessary for activity. Other alterations to the ?-chain were also well-tolerated. The incorporation of a single alkenyl bond into the ?-chain ( 21a , Table 3 , entry 3) increased the potency of the compound 10-fold compared to orlistat. Several other olefinic compounds showed good potency toward FASTE, i.e., 15j ( Table 2 , entry 3), 21a – c ( Table 3 , entries 3, 8, and 10, respectively), and 15k ( Table 3 , entry 15) even though they were not part of direct head-to-head comparisons. Even the placement of an alkene at the terminal position of the ?-chain is tolerated as in compounds 15i ( Table 3 , entry 17) and 17f ( Table 3 , entry 11). A small set of compounds were synthesized with ?-chains other than simple hydrocarbons. Two of these compounds, 17e and 21c ( Table 3 , entries 7 and 10, respectively), were at least as active as orlistat in the biochemical assay, providing additional support for the idea that significant structural variability within the ?-chain can be accommodated by FASTE. (iii) Modifications to the Amino Ester Side Chain Orlistat contains an N -formyl- l -leucine moiety branching from the ? carbon (C6) of the lactone. Interactions between the enzyme and the amino ester may contribute to positioning orlistat at the active site. 11 Interestingly, the substitution of glycine for leucine at this position ( 15g , Table 3 , entry 16) had little effect on potency toward the FAS thioesterase. Results from other head-to-head comparisons of compounds with long ?-chains, i.e., 15b ( Table 3 , entry 5) versus 15c ( Table 3 , entry 6), were similar, indicating such substitutions are tolerated but provide no significant enhancement in potency by themselves. Importantly, though, in compounds with much shorter ?-chains that contain an alkenyl bond, substitution of the amino ester yielded a greater than 10-fold increase in potency as with 15i ( Table 3 , entry 17) versus 15h ( Table 4 , entry 8). Overall, 12 of the congeners we present here contain an N -formyl-glycine moiety that lends greater conformational flexibility than the N -formyl-leucine moiety and significantly decreases the compounds' overall hydrophobicity. Nine of these compounds had significantly improved inhibitory activity toward FASTE compared to orlistat. A small set of congeners (8) containing valine, phenylalanine, and histidine at the amino ester position were also synthesized and tested. These compounds also exhibited good potency toward the enzyme, suggesting a wide range of substitutions at this position are accommodated by the enzyme. (iv) Modifications in Chirality Several compounds (11) with differing relative and absolute stereochemistry at C?, C?, and/or C? were also synthesized and tested. While no head-to-head comparisons were made, initial indications suggest that stereochemical changes at C? ( R versus S ) abrogates inhibitory activity toward the FASTE such as with compounds 16a ( Table 4 , entry 6; IC50) 9.74 ?M) and 16b ( Table 4 , entry 9; IC50) 45.11 ?M). However, changes to chirality at C? appear to be tolerated, i.e., 17i ( Table 3 , entry 4; IC50) 0.18 ?M), as long as the S -configuration is retained at the ?-chain. Somewhat surprisingly, inverted stereochemistry at C?, the carbon from which the amino ester side chain branches off the main ?-chain, was also tolerated. In fact, compound 17a ( Table 2 , entry 2), with increased potency both toward FASTE and in cell-based assays, has inverted stereochemistry at C?. The vast majority of compounds with this inverted stereochemistry contained an N -formyl-glycine moiety that allows for greater conformational flexibility; however, we acknowledge the possibility of an alternate binding mode to the enzyme.  (i) Modifications to the ?-Chain In general, the inhibitory activity toward FAS is tolerant to changes in the length of the ?-chain. An ?-chain of just two carbons appears to be sufficient for good potency. Compounds 17a ( Table 2 , entry 2), 15f , and 17b ( Table 3 , entries 14 and 18, respectively) all have ?-chains less than the six carbons found in orlistat, and each has an IC50 equal to or less than that of orlistat. In fact, 17a , with an ethyl ?-chain, has an IC50 of 0.23 ?M, which is greater than 6-fold more potent than orlistat (IC50) 1.35 ?M). The reduction of the ?-chain to a methyl group, however, generally resulted in reduced potency. Compound 15e ( Table 4 , entry 7), which has the same structure as orlistat with the exception of having a methyl group in the ?-chain position, is approximately 8-fold less potent than orlistat. We have also observed that ebelactone B, which contains an ethyl ?-chain, is roughly 10 times more potent than ebelactone A, which contains a methyl ?-chain 20 (data not shown). Altogether these data establish that an ?-chain of just two carbons is sufficient for retention of good potency toward FAS. This observation is consistent with the recent finding from the crystal structure of orlistat bound to the FAS thioesterase which shows the ?-chain packs against the histidine residue of the catalytic triad. 11 On the basis of this structure, an ethyl moiety is expected to maintain such packing where a methyl group would be insufficient to extend to this histidine.  (ii) Modifications to the ?-Chain Optimization of the ?-chain would seem to present a greater challenge because it binds within the putative palmitate binding pocket of the FAS thioesterase, helping to properly position the ?-lactone in the vicinity of the catalytic triad. 11 , 21 Therefore, truncation or other alteration of the ?-chain could lead to decreased potency if the conjugate bond cannot be formed. In a direct head-to-head comparison, the reduction of the ?-chain from 11 carbons ( 17c , Table 4 , entry 2) to just four carbons ( 23b , Table 3 , entry 2) resulted in a 15-fold increase in potency against FASTE in the biochemical assay, suggesting that the full length ?-chain is not necessary to position the ?-lactone at the catalytic triad. Even though they have additional structural changes, compounds 17d and 15f ( Table 3 , entries 12 and 14, respectively) also have ?-chains of reduced length and have increased potency compared to orlistat, providing further support that the full length chain is not necessary for activity. Other alterations to the ?-chain were also well-tolerated. The incorporation of a single alkenyl bond into the ?-chain ( 21a , Table 3 , entry 3) increased the potency of the compound 10-fold compared to orlistat. Several other olefinic compounds showed good potency toward FASTE, i.e., 15j ( Table 2 , entry 3), 21a – c ( Table 3 , entries 3, 8, and 10, respectively), and 15k ( Table 3 , entry 15) even though they were not part of direct head-to-head comparisons. Even the placement of an alkene at the terminal position of the ?-chain is tolerated as in compounds 15i ( Table 3 , entry 17) and 17f ( Table 3 , entry 11). A small set of compounds were synthesized with ?-chains other than simple hydrocarbons. Two of these compounds, 17e and 21c ( Table 3 , entries 7 and 10, respectively), were at least as active as orlistat in the biochemical assay, providing additional support for the idea that significant structural variability within the ?-chain can be accommodated by FASTE.  (iii) Modifications to the Amino Ester Side Chain Orlistat contains an N -formyl- l -leucine moiety branching from the ? carbon (C6) of the lactone. Interactions between the enzyme and the amino ester may contribute to positioning orlistat at the active site. 11 Interestingly, the substitution of glycine for leucine at this position ( 15g , Table 3 , entry 16) had little effect on potency toward the FAS thioesterase. Results from other head-to-head comparisons of compounds with long ?-chains, i.e., 15b ( Table 3 , entry 5) versus 15c ( Table 3 , entry 6), were similar, indicating such substitutions are tolerated but provide no significant enhancement in potency by themselves. Importantly, though, in compounds with much shorter ?-chains that contain an alkenyl bond, substitution of the amino ester yielded a greater than 10-fold increase in potency as with 15i ( Table 3 , entry 17) versus 15h ( Table 4 , entry 8). Overall, 12 of the congeners we present here contain an N -formyl-glycine moiety that lends greater conformational flexibility than the N -formyl-leucine moiety and significantly decreases the compounds' overall hydrophobicity. Nine of these compounds had significantly improved inhibitory activity toward FASTE compared to orlistat. A small set of congeners (8) containing valine, phenylalanine, and histidine at the amino ester position were also synthesized and tested. These compounds also exhibited good potency toward the enzyme, suggesting a wide range of substitutions at this position are accommodated by the enzyme.  (iv) Modifications in Chirality Several compounds (11) with differing relative and absolute stereochemistry at C?, C?, and/or C? were also synthesized and tested. While no head-to-head comparisons were made, initial indications suggest that stereochemical changes at C? ( R versus S ) abrogates inhibitory activity toward the FASTE such as with compounds 16a ( Table 4 , entry 6; IC50) 9.74 ?M) and 16b ( Table 4 , entry 9; IC50) 45.11 ?M). However, changes to chirality at C? appear to be tolerated, i.e., 17i ( Table 3 , entry 4; IC50) 0.18 ?M), as long as the S -configuration is retained at the ?-chain. Somewhat surprisingly, inverted stereochemistry at C?, the carbon from which the amino ester side chain branches off the main ?-chain, was also tolerated. In fact, compound 17a ( Table 2 , entry 2), with increased potency both toward FASTE and in cell-based assays, has inverted stereochemistry at C?. The vast majority of compounds with this inverted stereochemistry contained an N -formyl-glycine moiety that allows for greater conformational flexibility; however, we acknowledge the possibility of an alternate binding mode to the enzyme.  Summary of All Orlistat Derivatives Synthesized In Table 1 , we summarize all orlistat derivatives prepared in this study with yields and diastereoselectivity of the key TMAL reaction process as well as yields for subsequent amino ester introduction via Mitsunobu or acylation chemistry.  Effect of Compounds on Tumor Cell Apoptosis Each compound was also tested in MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells and Hs58.Fs foreskin fibroblasts to distinguish mechanism-based cell death elicited by inhibition of FAS from general cytotoxicity. To establish the degree to which each cell type depends on FAS for survival, we treated them with siRNA targeting FAS or with 25 ?M orlistat ( Figure 2 ). Both treatments induced death in the cancer cells but had only minimal effect on the fibroblasts. Importantly, the absolute level of apoptosis was essentially equivalent in both cell lines when they were treated with staurosporine, a compound known to induce apoptosis via an unrelated cAMP-mediated mechanism 22 (data not shown). These results establish that the cancer cells are dependent on FAS for survival but the fibroblasts are not. Three compounds ( 17a , 15j , and valilactone) were identified that had increased potency toward the thioesterase of FAS and in cell-based assays and that showed selective toxicity to the cancer cells compared to fibroblasts ( Table 2 ). The enhanced potency of this subset of compounds toward cells could be due to their increased affinity for the thioesterase domain, their enhanced aqueous solubility (cLogP values of less than 5 vs 8.6 for orlistat), or some combination of both. One other compound, 15g ( Table 3 , entry 16) had better potency than orlistat in the cell-based assays, even though its performance against the recombinant thioesterase was not significantly different from orlistat. The increase in cellular potency of this compound is probably due to a single structural variation, the substitution of a glycine at the amino ester position, which makes the compound less hydrophobic and reduces its cLogP. The remainder of the compounds either had a reduction in potency toward tumor cells or lost selectivity for tumor cells over the fibroblasts. Most of the compounds having good potency toward the recombinant thioesterase exhibited an IC50 in tumor cells greater than that of orlistat. There are two possibilities to explain this observation. First, it is conceivable that the FAS holoenzyme, in the context of the cellular environment, displays a thioesterase with a catalytic cleft that is structurally distinct from that of the recombinant thioesterase. Second, and probably more likely, is the possibility that these compounds simply have reduced ability to traverse the plasma membrane. Some of the compounds also lost selectivity for tumor cells over fibroblasts, which may be indicative of the reactivity of these compounds for other enzymes, especially other serine hydrolases that may be important for survival of all cells.  Materials and Methods Chemical Synthesis and Characterization All reactions were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere in flame-dried glassware. Dichloromethane, acetonitrile, methanol, tetrahydrofuran, and ethyl ether were purified by passage through activated molecular sieves. Hünig's base and triethylamine were distilled from potassium hydroxide prior to use. All other commercially obtained reagents were used as received. 1H NMR chemical shifts are reported as ? values in ppm relative to CDCl3 (7.27 ppm) and coupling constants ( J ) are reported in hertz (Hz). Unless indicated otherwise, deutero-chloroform (CDCl3) served as an internal standard (77.23 ppm) for all 13C spectra. Flash column chromatography was performed using 60 Å silica gel (Silicycle, 230–400 mesh) as stationary phase. Mass spectra were obtained at the Mass Spectrometry Application and Collaboration Facility (Texas A&M University). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using glass-backed silica gel 60F254 (Silicycle, 250 ?M thickness). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were acquired using Varian spectrometers at the frequency indicated. Solvents are indicated for each compound. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm referenced to the residual nondeuterated solvent as an internal standard. 1H NMR coupling constants ( J ) are reported in hertz (Hz) and multiplicities are abbreviated as follows: app = apparent, s = singlet, d = doublet, dd = doublet of doublets, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet, br = broadband signal.

TMAL Reaction ZnCl2 (398 mg, 2.92 mmol) was fused under vacuum and then allowed to cool to room temperature under a flow of nitrogen. Then 7.5 mL of dry CH2Cl2 was then added via syringe, followed by a solution of aldehyde 8f (500 mg, 1.46 mmol) in 2.5 mL of CH2Cl2 and ketene acetal 3d (719 mg, 2.04 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 60 h at ambient temperature. Then 5 mL of pH 7 buffer were added, and the mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 min, filtered through a pad of Celite, and washed with CH2Cl2. The organic filtrate was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on SiO2 (10:1, hexanes:EtOAc) to provide the mixture of silyloxy-?-lactone diastereomers as a pale-yellow oil. 1H NMR (500 MHz) analysis of the mixture of diastereomers indicated a diastereomeric ratio of 8:1. Without further purification, the mixture was used directly in the next step. Desilylation To a stirred solution of the mixture of silyloxy-?-lactones in 24 mL of CH3CN cooled to 0 °C, 2.4 mL of HF (48%) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 2 h, allowed to warm to ambient temperature, and stirred for an additional 5 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with 100 mL of Et2O, quenched carefully with cold saturated NaHCO3, and washed with brine. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on SiO2 (10:1, hexanes:EtOAc) to provide the hydroxy-?-lactone 13 (190 mg, 44%) and a mixture of the two diastereomers (112 mg, 14%) as white solids (58% overall, 2 steps).

Fluorogenic Assay for Detection of FASTE Inhibition The synthetic fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl heptanoate (4-MUH), was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The reaction mixture consisted of 500 nM FASTE in buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl at pH 7.4), which was preincubated with 2.5 ?L of test compounds dissolved in DMSO at final concentrations of 0.32–100 ?M and/or 0.08–10 ?M at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was initiated by addition of 5 ?L of 1.25 mM 4-MUH in 1:1 DMSO:buffer. The resulting fluorescence from liberated 4-methylumbelliferone was measured every 5 min at 350/450 nm for 40–60 min. 4-MUH incubated without enzyme served as a background control. Results are the average of triplicate data points.  Cell Viability Assays for Determination of Test Compound Potencies MB-MDA-231 or human fibroblast cells were plated in 96-well plates in appropriate media and incubated overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were treated with test compounds (0.1–100 ?M) or vehicle in triplicate, with a final percentage of DMSO not exceeding 1% (v/v). At 48 h, the medium was aspirated and replaced with complete MEM, containing 333 ?g/mL [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2 H -tetrazolium (MTS) and 25 ?M phenazine methosulfate (PMS), using the CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). Plates were incubated for 2 h and absorbance was assayed at 490 nm. Background levels of formazan formation were measured in medium alone. IC50 values were derived from dose–response curves.  Cell Lines The MDA-MB-231 cell line and Hs 58.Fs cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MDA-MB-231 tumor cells were maintained in minimum essential medium Eagle (MEM) with Earl's Salts (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA), MEM vitamins (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.), nonessential amino acids (Mediatech, Inc.), and antibiotics (Omega Scientific, Inc., Tarzana, CA). Human fibroblast (Hs 58.Fs) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. All cells were grown at 37 °C under a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere.  RNA Interference siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Cells were plated in 96-well plates and grown for 48 h prior to transfection with 100 nM FAS SMARTpool (M-003954-02) or nonsilencing control (D-001206-13) siRNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) as previously described. 24  Inhibition of Fatty Acid Synthase with Orlistat Orlistat (Xenical) was extracted from capsules (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) as previously described. 24 Cells were plated in 96-well plates for 48 h, followed by treatment with 25 ?M orlistat or vehicle control for 72 h.  DNA Fragmentation Assay Apoptosis was monitored by measuring the level of DNA fragments present following 72 h exposure to FAS siRNA or orlistat using the Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit (Roche) according to manufacturer instructions.  Supplementary Material Supplementary Date  Conclusion Synthesis of 28 orlistat congeners led to the identification of molecular features that can be optimized to generate ?-lactones with improved potency toward the thioesterase domain of FAS. Three of these compounds had an improved affinity for the thioesterase, an increased potency toward tumor cells, and greater selectivity for tumor cells over fibroblasts. Interestingly, these three compounds show considerable structural diversity. Each includes a unique amino ester substitution and a unique ?-chain. Additionally, compound 17a ( Table 2 , entry 2) has a truncated ?-chain and opposite chirality ( R versus S ) at the ? carbon. These results provide an important foundation for structure-based design of ?-lactones with optimal cytotoxicity profiles and the heterogeneity of the most promising compounds suggests a larger, more diverse study is warranted. The data presented here also underpin the idea that an orlistat congener can be optimized for use in preclinical drug design and for clinical drug development for the treatment of carcinomas.
