Mutation Analysis Identifies GUCY2D as the Major Gene Responsible for Autosomal Dominant Progressive Cone Degeneration Purpose Heterozygous mutations in the GUCY2D gene, which encodes the membrane-bound retinal guanylyl cyclase-1 protein (RetGC-1), have been shown to cause autosomal dominant inherited cone degeneration and cone–rod degeneration (adCD, adCRD). The present study was a comprehensive screening of the GUCY2D gene in 27 adCD and adCRD unrelated families of these rare disorders. Methods Mutation analysis was performed by direct sequencing as well as PCR and subsequent restriction length polymorphism analysis (PCR/RFLP). Haplotype analysis was performed in selected patients by using microsatellite markers. Results GUCY2D gene mutations were identified in 11 (40%) of 27 patients, and all mutations clustered to codon 838, including two known and one novel missense mutation: p.R838C, p.R838H, and p.R838G. Haplotype analysis showed that among the studied patients only two of the six analyzed p.R838C mutation carriers shared a common haplotype and that none of the p.R838H mutation carriers did. Conclusions GUCY2D is a major gene responsible for progressive autosomal dominant cone degeneration. All identified mutations localize to codon 838. Haplotype analysis indicates that in most cases these mutations arise independently. Thus, codon 838 is likely to be a mutation hotspot in the GUCY2D gene.  Methods Subjects and Clinical Examination Patients diagnosed with CD or CRD according to standard diagnostic criteria 2 and a family history consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance were included in the study and recruited at the Center for Ophthalmology, Tübingen, Germany, and ophthalmic specialist centers throughout Europe and the United States of America. The diagnosis of adCD or adCRD was mainly based on the results of full field electroretinography (ERG), performed according to ISCEV (International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision) standard. 18 Patients with reduced cone ERGs and normal rod ERGs received a diagnosis of adCD, whereas those with reduced cone and rod ERGs were deemed to have adCRD. Characteristic symptoms and signs, fundus appearance, and visual field results were used to corroborate the diagnosis. The study was performed according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethics committees of the participating institutions. Informed consent was obtained from all patients and examined family members. Phenotype analysis consisted of clinical ophthalmic examination, static and kinetic perimetry, Panel D15 color testing, dark-adapted final thresholds, Ganzfeld electroretinography, and multifocal electroretinography (mfERG). Ganzfeld electroretinography was recorded according to the ISCEV standard in all participating centers by one of three recording systems (Espion e2 system and ColorDome Ganzfeld stimulator, Diagnosys UK Ltd., Cambridge, UK, with DTL electrodes; Nicolet Spirit and Ganzfeld, Nicolet Biomedical, Madison, WI; and RetiScan and Ganzfeld; Roland Consult, Brandenberg, Germany). White flashes were used at a standard flash intensity of 2.25 or 3 cd-s/m2. mfERG was performed according to the method described by Sutter and Tran 19 (VERIS system; EDI, San Francisco, CA). Mutation Analysis Mutation analyses of all coding exons of the GUCY2D gene plus flanking intron sequences were performed in 19 subjects by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA, with 13 sets of gene-specific primer pairs ( Table 1 ) and subsequent DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed (BigDye Sequencing Chemistry; Applied Biosystems, Inc. [ABI], Darmstadt, Germany), and products were separated on a capillary sequencer (model 3100; ABI). In another eight patients, genotyping for the prevalent mutations at codon 838 in exon 13 of the GUCY2D gene was performed by means of PCR and subsequent restriction length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP) with the restriction enzyme Hha I, according to the manufacturer’s procedure (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Hha I has the recognition sequence -GCGC- and thus covers the nucleotides c.2511 to c.2514 of exon 13 (the last nucleotide of codon 837 and all three nucleotides of codon 838). PCR products were digested overnight and the RFLP pattern was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Mutations detected by PCR/RFLP were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Haplotype Analysis Haplotype analysis was performed in patients with the mutations c.2512C>T and c.2513G>A. Three polymorphic single-copy microsatellite markers ( D17S720 , D17S1796 , and D17S1812 ) with a heterozygosity greater 0.6 flanking the GUCY2D gene and located in the same recombination block according to Rutgers Combined Linkage-Physical Map 20 were selected. Microsatellite markers were PCR amplified and subsequently resolved and analyzed on a DNA sequencer (model 377; Applied Biosystems).

Results Mutation Analysis of <italic>GUCY2D</italic> in Patients with adCD or
adCRD A group of 27 unrelated patients with adCD or adCRD were recruited for mutation screening. Nineteen were screened for mutations in all coding exons of the GUCY2D gene, and another eight were genotyped for mutations at codon 838 of the GUCY2D gene by means of PCR-RFLP. Thereby, mutations in 11 patients were discovered: c.2512C>T (p.R838C) in 7; c.2513G>A (p.R838H) in 3, both previously identified; and a novel nucleotide substitution c.2512C>G (p.R838G) in 1 ( Table 2 ). The novel mutation c.2512C>G was excluded in 100 chromosomes of normal control subjects by DNA sequencing. Segregation of the mutant allele with the disease phenotype was demonstrated in all families for which samples from additional family members were available ( Fig. 1 ). The prevalence of GUCY2D gene mutations in our adCD and adCRD patient group was thus 11 of 27 patients (40%), and all mutations affected codon 838. Combining our and previous data showed the prevalence of GUCY2D gene mutations in adCD and adCRD to be 35% ( Table 2 ). Again virtually all mutations in these studies are located at codon 838. Haplotype Analysis of <italic>GUCY2D</italic> in Patients with c.2512C>T
or c.2513G>A Mutations To address the question of whether this accumulation of mutations at codon 838 is due to a founder effect or results from independent mutational events (a mutation hotspot), haplotype analysis was performed in three suitable families (ZD131, ZD181, ZD260) for the c.2512C>T mutation, applying markers D17S720 , D17S1796 , and D17S1812 , which flank the GUCY2D gene and which are located in the same recombination block. In addition, sequence variants identified within the GUCY2D gene were used to construct the haplotype. Haplotype reconstruction revealed a common haplotype in families ZD131 and ZD260, both of German origin, whereas the third family, of Italian descent, had a different haplotype. In addition, carriers of the GUCY2D mutations c.2512C>T (patients ZD111/7301, ZD204/13670, ZD138/9058) and c.2513G>A (patients ZD73/2132, ZD174/11824/, ZD197/13045), all without large enough families to reconstruct a haplotype, were genotyped for the three markers. Even without phase information, the data clearly showed no common disease-associated haplotype either for the c.2512C>T or the c.2513G>A mutation carriers. Thus, it appears that the high prevalence of these specific mutations cannot be explained by a founder effect. Phenotype of Patients with adCD or adCRD with <italic>GUCY2D</italic> Gene
Mutations The clinical data of all 11 independent index patients with identified GUCY2D gene mutations and 12 available affected relatives are given in Table 3 . Most patients had adCD (8/11) with reduced cone system–driven responses and essentially normal rod system–driven responses in the ERG. Three patients showed a phenotype of adCRD, presenting with both rod and cone ERG responses but more severely reduced cone responses. Disease onset ranged from infancy to young adulthood. Visual acuity was reduced in all patients, with a wide range from only mildly reduced (0.8) to severely reduced visual acuity (light perception). Glare sensitivity (6/11) and color vision abnormalities (9/11) were common findings. Most patients experienced normal night vision and had normal dark-adaptation thresholds. Scattered relative or absolute scotomas within the 30° visual field were observed in all but one patient. Visual field outer borders were mostly normal (6/11, no information for three patients), but two patients (RCD62/5127 and ZD174/11824) presented with concentric narrowing. Of note, fundus alterations were typically confined to the macula and presented even in advanced stages only with mottling or circumscribed atrophy of the RPE ( Figs. 2A, 2B, 2E ). Within families the older subjects typically had a more severe phenotype compared with the younger generations. Figure 2E shows the fundus of a 6-year-old subject (ZD249/15965/M) with normal appearance despite markedly changed ERG recordings. The fundus of his great uncle is shown in Figure 2G whose fundus presented a clear macular atrophy but an otherwise unremarkable optic disc, retinal vessels, and retinal periphery. Pronounced atrophic lesions and a bone spicule–like pigmentation in the periphery were found in only one family (RCD62), whose affected family members also suffered from rod dysfunction ( Figs. 2C, 2D ). In conclusion, the phenotype caused by GUCY2D gene mutations at codon 838 presented in most cases as CD with increased glare sensitivity, color vision abnormalities, and central scattered absolute and relative scotomas with preserved outer visual field border, and fundus changes typically confined to the macula. In general, apart from age-dependent disease progression interindividual variability was modest. However, all members of family RCD62 diverted from this commonly found phenotype, as they presented with extinguished cone and reduced rod responses, central and peripheral RPE atrophy, bone spicule–like peripheral pigmentation, narrowed visual field, and cecocentral scotoma, perhaps because they carried the mutation c.2512C>G (p.R838G), whereas all other patients carried c.2512C>T (p.R838C) or c.2513G>A (p.R838H), suggesting a more severe phenotype associated with this novel mutation. In addition, patient (ZD174/11824/F) with the c.2513G>A (p.R838H) mutation had a more severe phenotype with markedly reduced visual acuity, extinguished cone and rod system–driven ERG, and constricted peripheral visual field.

Discussion We report the result of a mutation screening of the GUCY2D gene in 27 unrelated patients with adCD or adCRD. Families with dominant CD and CRD are exceptionally rare. 1 This study includes by far the largest patient sample screened so far for these conditions, enabling now a more solid estimate of the prevalence of mutations in this gene. We identified GUCY2D gene mutations in 11 of 27 patients (40%), indicating that GUCY2D is a major disease gene for adCD and adCRD. All identified mutations clustered to codon 838. The most frequent mutation was c.2512C>T (p.R838C) in seven patients, followed by c.2513G>A (p.R838H) in three, and the novel mutation c.2512C>G (p.R838G) in one. The combined data of our study and two smaller previous studies suggests that approximately one third of adCD and adCRD is caused by mutations in GUCY2D . Almost all GUCY2D gene mutations identified so far in patients with adCD or adCRD are located at codon 838 or the two adjacent codons 837 and 839. As a consequence for the diagnostic routine, we therefore suggest that all adCD and adCRD patients be prioritized for codon 838 genotyping which can be easily performed by PCR-RFLP in a cost- and time-efficient manner. In accordance with previous reports 6 – 8 , 11 – 16 the typical phenotype of c.2512C>T (p.R838C) and c.2513G>A (p.R838H) mutation carriers was CD, with disease onset in childhood or early adolescence characterized by increased glare sensitivity, color vision abnormalities, and central scotomas, but preserved outer visual field border. Retinal morphology was relatively well preserved in young affected individuals and a certain degree of progression was seen with age. But also, in older subjects, retinal changes were subtle and confined to the macula. However, mutations in GUCY2D may also cause a more severe adCRD phenotype as observed in patient ZD174/11824/F and family RCD62. The latter carry a new mutation, c.2512C>G (p.R838G). Whether this novel mutation itself or other modifying factors cause this more severe phenotype is yet unknown. We also investigated whether the observed clustering of mutations to codon 838 of the GUCY2D gene is caused by a common founder of the individuals carrying the same mutation. Haplotype analysis showed that among the studied patients, only two families of German origin share a common haplotype, whereas the other eight analyzed patients do not. This indicates that the mutations at codon 838 most likely arose independently in most of the analyzed families and that codon 838 is likely to be a mutation hotspot for the adCD and adCRD phenotype. Codon 838 (nucleotide sequence -CGC-) comprises a typical mutable motif in human genes, the -CpG-dinucleotides. 21 , 22 It has been shown that spontaneous -CG- to -TA- mutations occur at these sites and are thought to be caused by deamination of methylated cytosine. Thus, the mutations observed at codon 838 of the GUCY2D gene, c.2512C>T and 2513G>A, could be due to this common mutable motif. Biochemical analyses demonstrated dominant negative effects for the RetGC-1 mutants p.R838C and p.R838H. They are less sensitive to high intracellular calcium concentrations in comparison to the wild-type protein and retain residual catalytic activity, even at high calcium levels. 23 , 24 Similar to p.R838C expressed alone, coexpressed p.R838C and wild-type RetGC-1 are less sensitive to calcium negative feedback, 23 which indicates that the reduced calcium sensitivity of p.R838C is dominant in the presence of wild-type RetGC-1. In contrast to the dominant negative effects observed for mutations at codon 838 in cone and cone rod dystrophy, for most GUCY2D gene mutations observed in Leber congenital amaurosis, a loss of function was demonstrated. On a cellular level, the reduced calcium sensitivity of the RetGC-1 mutants p.R838C and p.R838H may lead to increased cGMP synthesis in the dark and increased calcium influx through cGMP-gated cation channels. Consequently, calcium concentration in the photoreceptor may be elevated, which eventually leads to apoptosis of the photoreceptor. However, currently there is no animal model available for the mutations p.R838C and p.R838H in GUCY2D , and therefore pathophysiologic effects that take place in the photoreceptor are unknown. The phenotype observed in our patients suggests events that leave the retina morphologically relatively intact, but impair its function. Moreover, in conclusions also drawn from the phenotype in our patients, these events may predominantly affect the cone system and only secondarily the rod system. This may result from the fact that RetGC-1 is predominantly expressed in cones, 9 , 10 which could support this observation. In conclusion, we evaluated the prevalence of GUCY2D gene mutations in 27 unrelated patients with adCD and adCRD. We found that more than one third of the patients had mutations at codon 838 of the GUCY2D gene. We therefore propose that GUCY2D is to date the major disease gene involved in the pathogenesis of adCD and adCRD.
