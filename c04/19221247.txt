Genome-wide gene expression profiles of HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer: potential implications for treatment choices Objective To study the difference in gene expression between human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Design We used Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 arrays to examine gene expression profiles of OSCC and normal oral tissue. HPV DNA was detected using PCR followed by the Roche Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test, and the differentially expressed genes were analyzed to examine their potential biological roles using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software (IPA 5.0). Subjects Tumor tissue from 119 primary OSCC patients and normal oral tissue from 35 patients without cancer, all of whom were treated at three University of Washington-affiliated medical centers. Results HPV DNA was found in 41 of 119 (34.5%) tumors and 2 of 35 (5.7%) normal tissue samples, with 39 of 43 HPV being HPV type 16; there was a higher prevalence of HPV DNA in oropharyngeal cancer (23 of 31) than in oral cavity cancer (18 of 88). We found no significant difference in gene expression between HPV-positive and HPV-negative oral cavity cancer but found 446 probe sets (347 known genes) differentially expressed between HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer. The most prominent functions of these genes are DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell cycle. Some genes differentially expressed between HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer (e.g., TYMS, STMN1, CCND1 and RBBP4 ) are involved in chemotherapy or radiation sensitivity. Conclusion These results suggest that differences in the biology of HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer may have implications for the management of patients with these different tumors.  Patient characteristics The characteristics of the study population overall and by HPV status are presented in Table 1 . The cases were more likely to be older and to be current smokers, when compared with controls. More cases presented with oral cavity tumors than oropharyngeal tumors.  HPV detection in OSCC and control HPV DNA was found in 41 of 119 (34.5%) tumor tissues from cases, and in 2 of 35 (5.7%) normal oral tissues from controls. Twenty-three of 31 oropharyngeal tumor tissues (74.2%) were HPV positive, whereas only 18 of 88 oral cavity tumor tissues (20.5%) contained HPV DNA. The great majority (39/43) of the HPV-positive samples contained only HPV 16. The remaining HPV-positive samples contained HPV 32, 35, 45, and 53. HPV types 32 and 53 (low risk type) were found in oral cavity cancers whereas HPV type 35 and 45 (high risk type) were found in oropharyngeal cancers. The tumor sample that contained HPV 32 was determined to be positive for HPV by the nested PCR test but negative by the Roche kit (which does not test for HPV 32). Sequencing demonstrated homology to HPV 32.  Genome-wide comparison between HPV-positive and HPV-negative OSCC We used NFD = 1 as a selection criteria. This means that we control the number of false positive gene in the discover gene list to be fewer than 1. We did not find a significant difference in gene expression between HPV-positive and HPV-negative OSCC. When we analyzed oral cavity cancers and oropharyngeal cancers separately, we found no significant difference in gene expression between HPV-positive oral cavity cancers and HPV-negative oral cavity cancers, but we found 446 probe sets ( Supplement 1 , please see online version of manuscript) differentially expressed in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers compared to HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers. This means that one probe set among 446 probe sets could be a false positive finding, corresponding to a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.2%. The molecular and cellular functions of these genes that had the lowest p-values from the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, IPA 5.0 were DNA replication, DNA recombination, DNA repair, and cell cycle ( Table 2 ).  Comparisons to controls In order to determine which, if any, of these 446 probe sets were up- or downregulated when compared to normal oral tissue, we compared HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers to HPV-negative normal oropharyngeal tissues from controls. Among 446 probe sets, 299 were significantly different between HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers and HPV-negative oropharyngeal controls (p < 0.05), with 222 probe sets upregulated and 77 probe sets downregulated. Many of the genes involved in DNA replication, cell cycle and cell proliferation, such as RPA2, LIG1, POLD1, POLH, MCM2, MCM3, MCM7, NASP, CDC7, CCNE2, CDKN2A, CDK2, RBBP4, PCNA , and Ki67, were upregulated in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. We also found upregulation of genes involved in DNA repair, such as XRCC1, DDB2, FANCG and TOPBP1 . Cell cycle genes that were downregulated were CCND1, APC and HIPK2 . The top 50 probe sets for upregulated and downregulated genes are presented in Table 3 . A complete list of the 299 differentially expressed probe sets is in Supplement 2 (please see online version of manuscript). When comparing HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers to HPV-negative oropharyngeal controls using these 446 probe sets, we found 79 upregulated probe sets and 122 downregulated probe sets. Table 4 lists the top 50 probe sets from this analysis. The list of 201 probe sets is shown in Supplement 3 (please see online version of manuscript). There were 21 probe sets that were upregulated in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers but downregulated in HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers, and four were downregulated in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers but upregulated in HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers ( Table 5 ).  Materials and Methods Study population Eligible cases were patients with first incident primary OSCC scheduled for surgical resection or biopsy between December 2003 and May 2006 at one of three University of Washington-affiliated medical centers in Seattle, WA. We were able to recruit 135 patients from among 184 eligible patients,. Among 135 consented patients, tissue could not be obtained from seven patients, and two patients had a final pathological diagnosis of dysplasia. These nine patients were excluded from the study. Eligible controls were patients who had oral surgery for treatment of diseases other than cancer, such as obstructive sleep apnea, at the same institutions and during the same time period in which the OSCC cases were treated. In that time period, there were 45 eligible controls approached for participation by study staff, of whom 37 were recruited. Each patient was interviewed using a structured questionnaire regarding demographic, medical, and lifestyle history, including tobacco and alcohol use. Data on tumor characteristics (site, stage) were obtained from medical records. Two cancer patients who enrolled in the study but did not consent to having their medical records reviewed were excluded from analysis. Thus, 124 cancer patients were included in this study. This research was conducted with written informed consent and institutional review board approval. Tissue Collection Tumor tissue was obtained at the time of resection from patients with primary OSCC prior to chemo/radiation therapy. Normal oral or oropharyngeal tissue was obtained from controls. One control provided two normal tissues and one cancer case had a large tumor that was divided into five pieces. Immediately after surgical removal, each tumor or normal tissue was soaked in RNALater (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for a minimum of 12 hours at 4° C and transferred to long term storage at ?80° C prior to use. DNA Microarray The DNA and RNA from each specimen were simultaneously extracted using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To increase DNA purity, we modified the DNA extraction protocol to include the use of a “back extraction buffer” (4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 50 mM sodium citrate, and 1 M Tris, pH 8.0). RNA was further purified with the use of an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per Affymetrix recommendations. For expression array analysis, 1.0 to 2.5 ?g of total RNA was converted to double stranded cDNA using a GeneChip Expression 3?-Amplification One-cycle DNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The cDNA was purified and used in an in vitro transcription reaction to produce cRNA using the GeneChip Expression 3?-Amplification Reagents Kit (Affymetrix). The newly synthesized and biotin labeled cRNA was hybridized to a U133 2.0 Plus GeneChip (Affymetrix) and scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G in the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Genomics Shared Resources as per Affymetrix protocols. Quality Control (QC) of Microarray Results We used the QC criteria specified by Affymetrix ( http://www.affymetrix.com/support/downloads/manuals/data_analysis_fundamentals_manual.pdf ) followed by the “affyQCReport” and “affyPLM” packages in Bioconductor ( http://www.bioconductor.org ) to search for poor quality GeneChips. These procedures identified seven GeneChips that did not pass QC tests (five from cancer patients and two from controls), and which were eliminated from further analyses. Thus 123 GeneChips from 119 cancer cases and 36 GeneChips from 35 controls were included in this analysis. HPV Genotyping We screened all samples for the presence of HPV DNA using a nested PCR based protocol 11 . All samples that had a positive PCR result and about 40% of the samples that had a negative result were tested for HPV DNA presence using the LINEAR ARRAY HPV Genotyping Test (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) under a research use only agreement. In brief, 50 to 75 ng of DNA were PCR-amplified as per kit protocols, followed by hybridization to strip arrays containing complementary sequences to the PCR products for 37 HPV genotypes (including the 13 “high risk” genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) ( Fig. 1 ) and human ?-globin (as an assay control). The results from the nested PCR protocol and the LINEAR ARRAY HPV Genotyping Test showed 100% corroboration. To further verify genotype calls by the linear array, we amplified a small subset of the samples using HPV type 16 specific primers, sequenced the amplified products, and compared them against a known HPV type 16 sequence (Genbank gi: 333031). Data Analysis Tumors were classified according to site as follows: oral cavity (including tongue, buccal mucosa, gingival, hard palate, retromolar trigone and floor of mouth) vs. oropharynx (including tonsils, soft palate, uvula, oropharynx and base of tongue). Gene expression values for the ~54,000 probe sets were first extracted from probe intensity values (CEL files) using the gcRMA algorithm. We then eliminated the probe sets that either showed no variation across the samples (inter-quartile range less than 0.1 on log2 scale) or that were expressed at very low magnitude (the maximum of the expression value across the samples is less than 3 on log 2 scale). These exclusions helped to limit the number of statistical tests applied when detecting differences between HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors. After these two filtering processes, ~21,000 probe sets remained for further analysis. Statistical tests were carried out to compare HPV-positive and HPV-negative OSCC using a regression framework implemented in GenePlus software ( http://www.enodar.com/ ). To control for the type I error rate, we chose to declare a particular group of genes either “upregulated/overexpressed” or “downregulated/underexpressed” based on a pre-specified Number of False Discoveries (NFD) 12 . The choice of NFD, with an appropriate account for the number of genes under investigation ( J ), dictates the threshold for individual gene-specific p-values as NFD/ J . To determine whether the probe sets identified in the above analysis were up- or downregulated when compared to normal oral tissue, for each probe set we compared the mean expression values of each cancer group with those of controls using linear regression, calculating a robust estimator of variance, and accounting for the fact that multiple samples were tested for some subjects. The probe sets were then placed in order by ascending p-value, and a cutoff of 0.05 was chosen to indicate significant differences in expression. The functional roles of the genes differentially expressed between HPV-positive and HPV-negative OSCC were assessed through the use of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, IPA 5.0 (Ingenuity® Systems, www.ingenuity.com ). The function analysis identified the biological functions by performing Fischer’s exact tests to test the null hypothesis that the set of differentially expressed genes were not representative of each biological function.

Results Patient characteristics The characteristics of the study population overall and by HPV status are presented in Table 1 . The cases were more likely to be older and to be current smokers, when compared with controls. More cases presented with oral cavity tumors than oropharyngeal tumors. HPV detection in OSCC and control HPV DNA was found in 41 of 119 (34.5%) tumor tissues from cases, and in 2 of 35 (5.7%) normal oral tissues from controls. Twenty-three of 31 oropharyngeal tumor tissues (74.2%) were HPV positive, whereas only 18 of 88 oral cavity tumor tissues (20.5%) contained HPV DNA. The great majority (39/43) of the HPV-positive samples contained only HPV 16. The remaining HPV-positive samples contained HPV 32, 35, 45, and 53. HPV types 32 and 53 (low risk type) were found in oral cavity cancers whereas HPV type 35 and 45 (high risk type) were found in oropharyngeal cancers. The tumor sample that contained HPV 32 was determined to be positive for HPV by the nested PCR test but negative by the Roche kit (which does not test for HPV 32). Sequencing demonstrated homology to HPV 32. Genome-wide comparison between HPV-positive and HPV-negative OSCC We used NFD = 1 as a selection criteria. This means that we control the number of false positive gene in the discover gene list to be fewer than 1. We did not find a significant difference in gene expression between HPV-positive and HPV-negative OSCC. When we analyzed oral cavity cancers and oropharyngeal cancers separately, we found no significant difference in gene expression between HPV-positive oral cavity cancers and HPV-negative oral cavity cancers, but we found 446 probe sets ( Supplement 1 , please see online version of manuscript) differentially expressed in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers compared to HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers. This means that one probe set among 446 probe sets could be a false positive finding, corresponding to a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.2%. The molecular and cellular functions of these genes that had the lowest p-values from the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, IPA 5.0 were DNA replication, DNA recombination, DNA repair, and cell cycle ( Table 2 ). Comparisons to controls In order to determine which, if any, of these 446 probe sets were up- or downregulated when compared to normal oral tissue, we compared HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers to HPV-negative normal oropharyngeal tissues from controls. Among 446 probe sets, 299 were significantly different between HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers and HPV-negative oropharyngeal controls (p < 0.05), with 222 probe sets upregulated and 77 probe sets downregulated. Many of the genes involved in DNA replication, cell cycle and cell proliferation, such as RPA2, LIG1, POLD1, POLH, MCM2, MCM3, MCM7, NASP, CDC7, CCNE2, CDKN2A, CDK2, RBBP4, PCNA , and Ki67, were upregulated in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. We also found upregulation of genes involved in DNA repair, such as XRCC1, DDB2, FANCG and TOPBP1 . Cell cycle genes that were downregulated were CCND1, APC and HIPK2 . The top 50 probe sets for upregulated and downregulated genes are presented in Table 3 . A complete list of the 299 differentially expressed probe sets is in Supplement 2 (please see online version of manuscript). When comparing HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers to HPV-negative oropharyngeal controls using these 446 probe sets, we found 79 upregulated probe sets and 122 downregulated probe sets. Table 4 lists the top 50 probe sets from this analysis. The list of 201 probe sets is shown in Supplement 3 (please see online version of manuscript). There were 21 probe sets that were upregulated in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers but downregulated in HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers, and four were downregulated in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers but upregulated in HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers ( Table 5 ). Comment Human Papillomaviruses (HPV) are small DNA viruses that are known to be associated with a subset of OSCC. We found significant differences in gene expression on the genome-wide level between HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers, but not in oral cavity cancers. That our results depend on tumor site is consistent with the large body of evidence that HPV are more frequently detected in, and more strongly associated with, the development of oropharyngeal cancers than cancers in other head and neck sites 13 . Our results confirm the difference between HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers on the molecular level. The top functions of genes that were differentially expressed between HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers based on the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis were DNA replication, DNA recombination, DNA repair, and cell cycle. HPV do not encode DNA or RNA polymerase but depend on the host cell’s cell cycle control and replication machinery to enter S phase and they replicate along with host cell DNA. HPV drive cells into S phase through binding and inactivating Rb by their E7 oncoprotein and by displacing E2F 14 . We found upregulation of many cell cycle genes in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers, such as CCNE2, E2F, CDC7 and CDKN2A. We also found upregulation of PCNA and Ki67 , markers of cell proliferation, in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. This finding is consistent with observations that HPV 16 enhances proliferation of an OSCC cell line 15 . Some of the genes that we found differentially expressed between HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors have been reported to be associated with chemosensitivity to cisplatin, 5-FU, and paclitaxel, common chemotherapeutic agents used for treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). A study in breast cancer cell lines demonstrated that the cell line which was most sensitive to cisplatin expressed low levels of cyclin D1, and that cell lines transfected with cyclin D1 siRNAs exhibited enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin 16 . Furthermore, cisplatin can suppress E6 mRNA, restore p53 function and enhance radiosensitivity in HPV 16 E6 containing SiHa cells 17 . Since we found lower expression of CCND1 in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers, it would be important to determine whether HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers are more sensitive to cisplatin than HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers. If so, cisplatin may be a good choice of adjuvant therapy for an HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patient. Thymidine synthase (TS) is a target enzyme for 5-FU, and high expression of TS is related to poor response to 5-FU based chemotherapy 18 . In the present study, we found higher expression of TS ( TYMS ) in HPV-positive than in HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers. Thus, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers may be more resistant to 5-FU chemotherapy. STMN1 , encodes stathmin, a protein involved in the regulation of microtubules. Two studies have shown that stathmin overexpression decreases sensitivity to paclitaxel in vitro 19 , 20 . P53 regulates the G2/M check point by reducing expression of stathmin 21 . We found upregulation of STMN1 in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. We speculate that inactivation of p53 by high-risk HPV E6 may cause increased expression of stathmin, resulting in greater resistance to paclitaxel compared to HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers. Further study is needed to confirm this. Radiation is a common treatment choice for oropharyngeal cancer, because of the morbidity associated with surgical resection. Torres-Roca et al . demonstrated that radiosensitive cell lines had higher expression of RBBP4 than radioresistant cell lines, and transfection of RBBP4 into cell lines induced radiosensitization of these cell lines 22 . We found upregulation of RBBP4 in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. It would be interesting for future study to examine whether HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers are more sensitive to radiation than HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers. Although the association between HPV infection and oropharyngeal cancer is well established, the clinical benefit of testing HPV in oropharyngeal cancer patients has not been established. Our results suggest the possibility of using HPV status for selecting personalized therapy for these patients. To translate these findings to patient management, clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of cisplatin, 5-FU, paclitaxel, or radiation in the treatment of oropharyngeal cancers based on their HPV status are clearly warranted. To the best of our knowledge, two previous studies have compared genome-wide gene expression between HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC directly, using the same Affymetrix chip as the current study 23 , 24 . Martinez, et al . were the only ones to specifically examine gene expression in oropharyngeal tissue 24 using three HPV-positive and four HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers, and four normal oral mucosa tissues. They identified 124 upregulated and 42 downregulated genes in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers as compared to HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers. Only three genes ( TYMS, TUBGCP3 and SEC24D ) from their list overlapped with ours. A greater overlap was seen between the respective lists of genes that were differentially expressed between HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers and normal tissues from controls. These genes included CDKN2A, PCNA, RFC4, MCM2, MCM3, CDC7, TYMS, CCNE2, USP1 , and ACTL6A . Slebos, et al . studied 36 HNSCC, including 15 oral cavity cancers, nine oropharyngeal cancers, nine laryngeal cancers and three hypopharyngeal cancers 23 . They detected HPV DNA in seven of nine oropharyngeal cancers but in none of the oral cavity cancers. They found 91 genes differentially expressed between HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC. We found 20 genes overlapping among our results and theirs. These included ACTL6A, ALG6, ASS1, CCDC52, CDC7, CDKN2A, CENPK, DHFR, EIF2B5, EZH2, LIG1, MCM2, MCM6, OPA1, RFC4, RPA2, STMN1, TOPBP1, USP1 and WEE1 . The difference between the results of these studies could be due to study design, different tumor sites and different approaches used for statistical analyses. Our analysis only included oropharyngeal cancers, whereas in the study by Slebos et al . one-third of the tumors were from other head and neck sites. To the extent that gene expression associations with HPV status differed in subsets of cases defined according to site, different results would be expected between our studies. Although both our and Martinez’s studies focused on oropharyngeal tumors, our much larger sample size would be expected to detect larger numbers of differentially expressed genes. Our study was limited by the small number of study subjects, particularly for comparisons among oropharyngeal cancer patients. With only eight HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers, it was not feasible to include cigarette smoking, sex, and age as covariates when we compared genome-wide gene expression between the HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal tumors. In conclusion, we found differences in gene expression in HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers. These differences suggest that 1) HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers may be more resistant to 5-FU and paclitaxel than HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers, 2) cisplatin may be a better choice in treatment of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers, and 3) HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers may also be more sensitive to radiation. Further study in cell lines and clinical trials are needed to investigate the possibility of using HPV as a guide for the management of oropharyngeal cancer.
