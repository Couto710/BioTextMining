Development of multi-epitope vaccines targeting wild-type (wt) sequence p53 peptides Loss of p53 tumor suppressor function is the most common abnormality in human cancer, which can result in enhanced presentation to immune cells of wild type sequence (wt) peptides from tumor p53 molecules, provides the rationale for wt p53 peptide-based cancer vaccines. We review evidence from preclinical murine tumor model and preclinical studies that led to the clinical introduction of wt p53 peptide-based vaccines for cancer immunotherapy. Overall, this review illustrates the complex process of wt p53 epitope selection and the issues and concerns involved in the application of p53-based vaccines for patients with cancer.
