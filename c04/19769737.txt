Harnessing CD1d-restricted T cells towards anti-tumor immunity in humans Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a distinct subset of T cells that recognize lipid antigens in the context of CD1d molecules. There is considerable body of evidence implicating a role for NKT cells in regulating anti-tumor immunity in mice. ?-galactosylceramide (?-GalCer) is a potent agonist ligand for type I NKT cells. We and others have shown that injection of ?-GalCer loaded DCs leads to clear expansion of NKT cells in vivo in cancer patients. Preclinical studies suggest the capacity of thalidomide analogues to enhance ligand dependent NKT activation, and provide the rationale for combination approaches that are now being designed. Recently, we have demonstrated the presence of CD1d restricted T cells specific for an inflammation associated lipid, lysophosphatidylcholine in patients with advanced myeloma. These studies suggest that type II NKT cells may play a role in sensing and regulating inflammation. Harnessing CD1d restricted T cells in cancer may depend on regulating the balance between type I and II NKT cells, and holds promise as a broad strategy for immune therapy of several cancers.  Conclusions Several subsets of CD1d restricted T cells are strongly implicated in tumor immunity. Recent clinical studies demonstrate the feasibility of harnessing type I NKT cells in vivo in patients with malignancy. NKT activation might be a first step toward utilizing these innate effectors for therapeutic benefit in tumor immunotherapy. Despite expanding knowledge, much remains to be learned about the characteristics and properties of NKT cell subsets and their ligands in vivo. Systematic studies in defined clinical settings are needed to further advance our knowledge of biologic effects of these cells and translating it to clinical benefit.
