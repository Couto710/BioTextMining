Smoothening the Controversial Role of Hedgehog in Hematopoiesis The role of multiple developmental signaling pathways in the regulation of hematopoiesis has been controversial. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell , two separate reports ( Hofmann et al., 2009 ; Gao et al., 2009 ) examine whether the Hedgehog signaling pathway modulates normal adult hematopoietic stem cells and blood formation.
