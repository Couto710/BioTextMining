Down-regulation of tumor suppressor gene FEZ1/LZTS1 in breast carcinoma involves promoter methylation and associates with metastasis FEZ1/LZTS1 is a tumor suppressor gene located in chromosomal band 8p22, and methylation has been identified as a mechanism for its loss of function in tumors. Chromosomal deletion at 8p22 is also frequent in breast cancer. We therefore examined whether LZTS1 plays a role in breast cancer. We analyzed expression of LZTS1 at both the RNA and protein levels, and promoter methylation in a number of primary tumors and cell lines from breast cancer. We also examined the association between LZTS1 expression and different clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer. We found that the expression of LZTS1 mRNA was reduced in 25 of 50 (50%) primary tumors and 29 of 30 (97%) breast cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining showed that LZTS1 protein was absent or down-regulated in 72 (72%) of 100 primary breast carcinomas. Reduced expression of LZTS1 at either the RNA or protein level was significantly correlated with lymph node metastases ( P <0.05). DNA methylation analysis revealed that the LZTS1 gene was frequently methylated in both cell lines and primary tumors from breast cancer, and the extent of DNA methylation was correlated with reduced expression of the gene. These findings suggest that LZTS1 plays a role in the development and progression of breast cancer at least through promoter methylation-mediated transcriptional downregulation.  Methods Breast cancer cell lines and primary tumor specimens Thirty breast cancer cell lines (Hs.578T, T-47D, MDA-MB-453, MCF7, HCC-70, HCC-1500, MDA-MB-361, HCC-202, BT-474, HCC-1937, HCC-1599, MDA-MB-231, DU-4475, HCC-1143, ZR-75-30, ZR-75-1, SK-Br-3, BRF-71T1, HCC-38, HCC-2218, BT-20, HCC-1395, BT-483, MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-415, MDA-MB-134, MDA-MB-468, SW527, MDA-MB-175, BT-549) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The immortalized non-neoplastic breast epithelial cell line BRF-97T was purchased from Biological Research Faculty & Facility (BRFF, Ijamsville, MD, USA), while the primary culture of human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) was purchased from Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ. Cells were propagated following standard protocols from the providers. All primary breast cancer specimens were obtained from patients who underwent surgical resection for clinical treatment of breast cancer from October to December of 2006 in the Cancer Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China. After the standard procedure for clinical diagnosis was completed, additional tissues were cut into small pieces, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in a -80°C freezer until use. Both tumor and adjacent normal tissues from 50 women diagnosed with IDC-NOS (invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise special) were used. All patients were females aged from 34 to 83 years old (mean age 54). Use of human tissues in this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Tumor Hospital of Tianjin Medical University. Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Concentrations of DNA and RNA were measured following standard protocols. For immunohistochemistry assay, 100 cases of formalin-fixed breast cancer were used. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and quantitative real-time RT-PCR Expression of LZTS1 mRNA in primary breast cancer and cell lines was determined by regular and real-time RT-PCR. The first strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using the Iscript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA) or the oligodeoxythymidylic acid primer system (TaKaRa, Japan). An RNA sample from a pool of normal human breast tissues (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used as the normal control. Primer sequences for regular RT-PCR are 5’-AGGGCCTGGAGCTGGAGGTCT-3’ and 5’-AGCCCGAGGACATCTGGTCA T-3’, and those for real-time PCR are 5’-TTTGGACTGCTTCTCTCAGTTCCT GC-3’ and 5 ’-TTTGACAATGTGTTGCCCAACCAAAG-3’. To avoid contamination of genomic DNA, each pair of PCR primers spanned at least one intron of the LZTS1 gene. GAPDH was used as an internal control. Its primer sequences are 5’-ATCACTGCCACCCAGAAGAC-3’ and 5’-ATGAGGTCCACCACCCTGTT-3’. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel and visualized after staining with ethidium bromide. Each RT-PCR assay was repeated at least once for confirmation. The intensity for a band was quantitated with image analysis software (Gel - Pro 4400 image System, China), and the ratio of LZTS1 signal to GAPDH signal was calculated for each normal and tumor sample. The ratio for a tumor was then divided by the ratio for matched normal tissue to indicate the relative level of expression in a tumor, and a reduced expression was defined when such a value was smaller than 0.5. In real-time PCR analysis, expression of LZTS1 in a sample was indicated by the ratio of LZTS1 signal to GAPDH signal. Each signal was the average of readings from triplicate reactions, and the ratio for each sample was normalized against the ratio from the normal control. Immunohistochemistry Tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated with xylene and a series of grades of alcohol. Antigen retrieval was carried out in 5 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 1.5 min in an autoclave, followed by cooling at room temperature for 45 min. After inactivation of endogenous peroxidase with 3% H2O2, sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 10 min and then incubated with polyclonal goat anti-LZTS1 antibody at a 1:75 dilution (Santa Cruz, USA) at 4°C overnight. The preimmune serum was used as the negative control. Sections were then reacted with biotinylated anti-goat antibody and streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase (Zhongshan Golden Bridge, China). Diaminobenzidine was used as a chromogen substrate. Finally sections were washed in distilled water and weakly counterstained with hematoxylin. All sections were examined independently by two pathologists (L.F. and L.C.), and agreement was reached for the grade of LZTS1 staining. LZTS1 immunoreactivity was classified into four groups using a previously reported scoring method ( 4 ): +/+ or strong (96-100% positive cells), +/- or moderate (51-95% positive cells), -/+ or weak (2-50% positive cells), and -/- or absent (<2% positive cells). Bisulfite sequencing We treated DNA with bisulfite as previously described ( 12 ). Briefly, 2 ?g of genomic DNA was diluted into 50 ?l with distilled water, 5.5 ?l of 2 M NaOH was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes. Thirty ?l of freshly prepared 10 mM hydroquinone (Sigma, USA) and 520 ?l of freshly prepared 3 M sodium bisulfite (pH 5.0) (Sigma, USA) were added to each tube. After thorough mixing, mineral oil was added to each tube and incubated at 50°C for 16 hours. Then 1 ml of DNA wizard cleanup resin (Promega, USA) was added and DNA was purified and eluted in 50 ?l of water following the instructions in the kit. After adding 5.5 ?l of 3 M NaOH and incubation at room temperature for 5 minutes, 1 ?l glycogen was added to each sample (Roch, USA), with 33 ?l of 10 M NH4Ac (Sigma, USA) and 3 volumes of ethanol to precipitate DNA. DNA was resuspended in 20 ?l distilled water and stored at -20°C until use. To analyze the CpG methylation status of LZTS1 promoter, two pairs of primers were designed from the CpG-enriched region within LZTS1 promoter: 2263/2662 (400 bp), 5’-GGTTTTGTGAGGGTTTTGTTATG-3’/5’-AA CCTAACCCCCTAAATCCC-3’; 2651/2967 (317 bp), 5’-GGGGGTTAGGTTGG GGTGGA-3’/5’-ACCTAACCCAAAACTTCTACTTCA-3’. PCR reaction was performed in a volume of 50 ?l containing 1 ?l of bisulfite-treated DNA. The PCR cycling profile consisted of an initial denaturing at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 4 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 62°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s; 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s; and an additional incubation at 72°C for 10 mins. PCR products from cell lines were sequenced directly, whereas PCR products from primary tumors were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promga, USA), and then subjected to sequencing (Invitrogen, China).

Results LZTS1 mRNA was frequently down-regulated in breast cancer Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the expression of LZTS1 mRNA in 50 pairs of breast cancer specimens and matched normal breast tissues. The results showed that the RNA level of LZTS1 was reduced in 25 of the 50 (50%) samples, including down-regulation in 18 of the 50 (36%) and absence of expression in 7 of the 50 (14%) samples, compared to matched normal breast tissues. Representative RT-PCR results from 6 pairs of breast cancer samples are shown in Figure 1A . Statistical analysis showed that LZTS1 mRNA expression was significantly reduced in breast cancer (?2 = 33.333, P < 0.001) compared to matched normal tissue. In addition, the absence or down-regulation of LZTS1 was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (?2 = 4.160, P <0.05, Table 1 ), but not with age, tumor size, or expression status of ER, PR, CerbB-2 and p53 expression (data not shown). Consistently, real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that LZTS1 mRNA expression was significantly reduced in breast cancer cell lines. When compared to a normal breast control, all breast cancer cell lines but Hs.578T displayed reduced LZTS1 mRNA expression by at least 60% ( Fig. 1B ). LZTS1 protein was frequently down-regulated in breast cancer To further evaluate whether down-regulation of LZTS1 in breast cancer also occurs at the protein level, immunohistochemical staining was performed in 100 pairs of breast cancer and matched normal tissue sample. The results showed that LZTS1 protein was expressed in normal breast ductal epithelial cells with a granular location in cytoplasm ( Fig. 2A, 2B ). In the 100 breast cancer samples examined, 72 (72%) showed absence or down-regulation of LZTS1 protein (28 +, 29 +/-, 29 -/+, and 14 -). LZTS1 protein expression in each pathology type is shown in Table 2 . LZTS1 protein was absent or down-regulated in 65 of 88 (74%) invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs) (23 +, 25 +/-, 26 -/+, and 14 -) ( Fig. 2C-2F ). Furthermore, absence or down-regulation of LZTS1 protein was correlated with lymph node metastasis (?2 = 9.631, P <0.05), since the rate of lymph node metastasis in the group of tumors with a status of “-“ or “-/+ expression was significantly higher than that in the group of tumors with an expression status of “+” or “+/-” (?2 = 9.423, P <0.05) ( Table. 1 ). DNA methylation of LZTS1 promoter was associated with reduced expression in breast cancer To quantitatively evaluate the status of promoter methylation of LZTS1 in cell lines and primary tumors from breast cancer, bisulfite-treated genomic DNA was subjected to PCR and sequenced to determine the level of promoter methylation. In total, we analyzed 11 breast cancer cell lines that showed down-regulation of LZTS1, 49 primary tumors of breast cancer, and 9 normal breast tissues. Methylation of CpG islands surrounding the transcription initiation site of LZTS1 was clearly increased in 8 breast cancer cell lines. Three breast cancer cell lines, HCC-202, BT-483 and HCC2218, did not show obvious promoter methylation in LZTS1 ( Fig. 3 , Table 3 ). For primary tumors, PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector and three clones were randomly picked and sequenced for each tumor sample ( Fig. 4A, 4B ). We defined the status of methylation at each CpG site as 1 when methylation was detected in all three clones (full methylation); 0.5 when methylation was detected in at least one of the three clones (partial methylation); and 0 when none of the clones showed methylation (no methylation). The methylation level for each of the 18 CpG dinucleotides within the PCR product is shown in Table 4 . While normal tissues had an average methylation level (AML) of 0.46 per CpG, that for the 49 tumors was 0.70 per CpG, which was significant higher than 0.46 ( P < 0.001, t test, Table 4 ). Figure 4B shows sequencing results for PCR products from a pair of normal and cancer tissues from the same patient, in which all three CpGs are methylated in the tumor but not in the normal tissue. According to their AMLs per CpG, we divided the tumors into three groups: higher level of methylation (AML ? 0.75), median level (0.75 > AML ? 0.65), and lower level (AML < 0.65). Chi square analysis showed that AML in the LZTS1 promoter inversely correlated with reduced expression (absence or down-regulation) of LZTS1 mRNA (?2 = 22.539, P < 0.005, Table. 5 ). Consistently, correspondence analysis showed that low AMLs for LZTS1 promoter and normal levels of LZTS1 expression were located closely, whereas high AMLs located closely with reduced or absent expression of LZTS1 ( Fig. 4C ). In the correspondence analysis, the shorter the distance between the AML spot and the expression spot, the stronger the correlation between the two parameters. Therefore, hypermethylation of CpGs in the LZTS1 promoter significantly correlated with absent or reduced expression of LZTS1 mRNA in breast cancer ( Fig. 4C ). As expected, RNA expression of LZTS1 significantly correlated with its protein expression (?2 = 29.965, P < 0.005, Table 5 ).

Furthermore, absence or down-regulation of LZTS1 protein was correlated with lymph node metastasis (?2 = 9.631, P <0.05), since the rate of lymph node metastasis in the group of tumors with a status of “-“ or “-/+ expression was significantly higher than that in the group of tumors with an expression status of “+” or “+/-” (?2 = 9.423, P <0.05) ( Table. 1 ).  DNA methylation of LZTS1 promoter was associated with reduced expression in breast cancer To quantitatively evaluate the status of promoter methylation of LZTS1 in cell lines and primary tumors from breast cancer, bisulfite-treated genomic DNA was subjected to PCR and sequenced to determine the level of promoter methylation. In total, we analyzed 11 breast cancer cell lines that showed down-regulation of LZTS1, 49 primary tumors of breast cancer, and 9 normal breast tissues. Methylation of CpG islands surrounding the transcription initiation site of LZTS1 was clearly increased in 8 breast cancer cell lines. Three breast cancer cell lines, HCC-202, BT-483 and HCC2218, did not show obvious promoter methylation in LZTS1 ( Fig. 3 , Table 3 ). For primary tumors, PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector and three clones were randomly picked and sequenced for each tumor sample ( Fig. 4A, 4B ). We defined the status of methylation at each CpG site as 1 when methylation was detected in all three clones (full methylation); 0.5 when methylation was detected in at least one of the three clones (partial methylation); and 0 when none of the clones showed methylation (no methylation). The methylation level for each of the 18 CpG dinucleotides within the PCR product is shown in Table 4 . While normal tissues had an average methylation level (AML) of 0.46 per CpG, that for the 49 tumors was 0.70 per CpG, which was significant higher than 0.46 ( P < 0.001, t test, Table 4 ). Figure 4B shows sequencing results for PCR products from a pair of normal and cancer tissues from the same patient, in which all three CpGs are methylated in the tumor but not in the normal tissue. According to their AMLs per CpG, we divided the tumors into three groups: higher level of methylation (AML ? 0.75), median level (0.75 > AML ? 0.65), and lower level (AML < 0.65). Chi square analysis showed that AML in the LZTS1 promoter inversely correlated with reduced expression (absence or down-regulation) of LZTS1 mRNA (?2 = 22.539, P < 0.005, Table. 5 ). Consistently, correspondence analysis showed that low AMLs for LZTS1 promoter and normal levels of LZTS1 expression were located closely, whereas high AMLs located closely with reduced or absent expression of LZTS1 ( Fig. 4C ). In the correspondence analysis, the shorter the distance between the AML spot and the expression spot, the stronger the correlation between the two parameters. Therefore, hypermethylation of CpGs in the LZTS1 promoter significantly correlated with absent or reduced expression of LZTS1 mRNA in breast cancer ( Fig. 4C ). As expected, RNA expression of LZTS1 significantly correlated with its protein expression (?2 = 29.965, P < 0.005, Table 5 ).  DNA methylation of LZTS1 promoter was associated with reduced expression in breast cancer To quantitatively evaluate the status of promoter methylation of LZTS1 in cell lines and primary tumors from breast cancer, bisulfite-treated genomic DNA was subjected to PCR and sequenced to determine the level of promoter methylation.

In the correspondence analysis, the shorter the distance between the AML spot and the expression spot, the stronger the correlation between the two parameters. Therefore, hypermethylation of CpGs in the LZTS1 promoter significantly correlated with absent or reduced expression of LZTS1 mRNA in breast cancer ( Fig. 4C ). As expected, RNA expression of LZTS1 significantly correlated with its protein expression (?2 = 29.965, P < 0.005, Table 5 ).  Discussion In this study, we found that the expression of LZTS1 was frequently reduced or even absent at both RNA and protein levels in primary tumors and cell lines from breast carcinoma. In addition, promoter methylation of LZTS1 was also frequently detected, and was found to correlate with downregulation of LZTS1 in breast cancer, indicating that promoter methylation is at least partially responsible for the downregulation of LZTS1 in breast cancer. Furthermore, downregulation and promoter methylation status were associated with metastasis in breast cancer. Promoter methylation is a common mechanism for transcriptional inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in human cancer, and tumor-specific promoter methylation and associated downregulation suggest a tumor suppressor function for a gene ( 13 ). While downregulation of LZTS1 was frequent in human tumors, occurrence of promoter methylation in LZTS1 has been detected in gastric cancer ( 3 ) and treatment of cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2’deoxycytidine restored the expression of LZTS1 in cancer cell lines ( 10 ), supporting the notion that LZTS1 is a tumor suppressor gene ( 1 ). Transfer of a large fragment of genomic DNA into cancer cells also demonstrated a tumor suppressor function of LZTS1 in tumor growth ( 6 ). More definitively, knockout of LZTS1 in mice significantly increased incidence of both spontaneous and carcinogen-induced cancers ( 14 , 15 ), likely through inhibition of cell cycle progression by regulating cell cycle regulators CDC25C and cdk1 ( 1 , 14 ). Consistent with these results, our findings of frequent downregulation and promoter methylation further support the status of LZTS1 as a tumor suppressor gene in human cancer. The role of LZTS1 as a tumor suppressor has been suggested by downregulation, promoter methylation, or mutation in different types of tumors, including gastric, lung, bladder, oral, prostate, and kidney cancers ( 2 - 4 , 7 - 11 ). In breast cancer, previous analysis of a smaller number of samples (15 cell lines and 10 primary tumors) showed frequent downregulation of LZTS1 ( 5 ). Our analysis of a larger number of samples and detection of both downregulation and promoter methylation indicate that LZTS1 also plays a role in the development of breast cancer as a tumor suppressor gene. In the present study, we found a significant correlation between reduced expression of LZTS1 and lymph node metastases in breast cancer, suggesting that loss of LZTS1 plays a role in tumor progression. Consistently, reduced expression of LZTS1 was positively associated with higher tumor grade in lung cancer ( 8 ) and presence of lymph node metastases in collecting duct carcinoma of the kidney ( 11 ). Loss of expression and/or promoter methylation were also associated with poorer survival of patients with cancer. For example, in malignant mesothelioma, the methylation status of LZTS1 was associated with worse patient survival ( 16 ) and in non-small cell lung cancer, which is more malignant and has worse survival than small cell lung cancer, the expression of LZTS1 was more frequently downregulated ( 2 ). Collectively, these findings suggest that reduced expression of LZTS1 could be a prognostic marker predicting patient survival in different cancers. In summary, LZTS1 was frequently down-regulated in breast cancer, which involves promoter methylation. Downregulation of LZTS1 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. These results not only indicate a role of LZTS1 in breast carcinogenesis, they also suggest that LZTS1 could become a biomarker predicting clinical outcome in breast cancer.  Discussion In this study, we found that the expression of LZTS1 was frequently reduced or even absent at both RNA and protein levels in primary tumors and cell lines from breast carcinoma.
