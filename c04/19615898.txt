Synthesis, Characterization and Anti-Melanoma Activity of Tetra- O -substituted Analogs of Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid Synthesis of seven semi-synthetic analogs of NDGA is described. An approach to NDGA derivitization is described in which the ortho -phenolic groups are tethered together by one atom, forming a 5-membered heterocyclic ring. The analogs were evaluated for cytotoxicity in four cancer cell lines and compared to NDGA and tetra- O -methyl-NDGA (M4N) (1a) . NDGA bis -cyclic sulfate (2a) , NDGA bis -cyclic carbonate (2b) , and methylenedioxyphenyl-NDGA (2d) and NDGA tetra acetate (1b) showed anti-cancer activity in vitro . Two compounds, (1b) and (2b) , were evaluated for anticancer activity in a mouse xenograft model of human melanoma and showed dose-dependent activity.
