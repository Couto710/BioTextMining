Synthesis and Evaluation of Radamide Analogues, A Chimera of Radicicol and Geldanamycin Previously, we reported the Hsp90 inhibitory activity of radamide, an open chain amide chimera of geldanamycin and radicicol. Attempts to further expand upon structure–activity relationships for this class of Hsp90 inhibitors led to the preparation of a series of radamide analogues focused on differing tether lengths and quinone mimics. In addition, the cup-shaped conformation adopted by the two natural products when bound to the Hsp90 N-terminal ATP binding pocket suggests that conformationally biased compounds may demonstrate improved binding and inhibition. The preparation and evaluation of radamide analogues with cis / trans ?, ? -unsaturated amides yielded compounds that exhibit improved antiproliferative activity. In addition, several analogues demonstrated the ability to induce degradation of Hsp90-dependent oncogenic signaling proteins in vitro, a hallmark of Hsp90 N-terminal inhibition.  Introduction Inhibition of the 90 kDa family of heat shock proteins (Hsp90) has become a major target for the development of anticancer drugs because of their well-defined role as molecular chaperones responsible for folding nascent polypeptides and refolding denatured proteins into their biologically active, three-dimensional conformations. 1 Numerous oncogenic proteins directly associated with all six hallmarks of cancer, including Her2, Raf, PLK, RIP, AKT, FAK, telomerase, and MET, have been shown to be dependent upon the Hsp90 protein folding machinery. 2 Hsp90 inhibition results in the simultaneous disruption of multiple oncogenic pathways, leading to client protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Known inhibitors of the Hsp90 protein folding process include the natural products, geldanamycin (GDA) and radicicol (RDC) ( Figure 1 ). RDC, the most potent inhibitor in vitro, exhibits no activity in vivo 3 as the allylic epoxide and the ?, ? , ? , ? -unsaturated ketone undergo nucleophilic addition that results in metabolites that exhibit little or no affinity for Hsp90. GDA, while less potent than RDC in vitro, maintains inhibitory activity in vivo. 4 In fact, an analogue of GDA, 17-AAG, exhibits enhanced affinity for tumorgenic Hsp90 and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of various cancers. Unfortunately, 17-AAG exhibits poor solubility and toxicity that is proving difficult to overcome for this class of inhibitors. Co-crystal structures of the Hsp90 N-terminal ATP binding site bound to RDC and GDA have provided information that was used to design chimeric inhibitors of Hsp90. 5 The resorcinolic phenols of RDC form hydrogen bonds with Leu34, Asp79, Gly83, and Thr171 through conserved water molecules, mimicking key interactions of the natural adenine base ( Figure 1 ). In contrast, the quinone moiety of GDA binds toward the surface of the pocket in the region corresponding to the diphosphate group of ADP, providing hydrogen bonding interactions with Lys58 and Asp40. In addition, the 17-methoxy substituent of the GDA quinone and the RDC epoxide form hydrogen bonds with Lys44, emphasizing the importance of this amino acid in inhibitor binding. We hypothesized that incorporating the key binding interactions provided by the resorcinol ring of RDC and the quinone moiety of GDA into a single molecule would result in a novel class of Hsp90 inhibitors that could unveil structure–activity relationships (SAR) for the natural products themselves. Radamide ( Figure 2 ) exhibited low micromolar inhibition of Hsp90 as measured by Her2 degradation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. 6 Interestingly, the corresponding hydroquinone precursor demonstrated ~3-fold increased inhibition, suggesting that a hydrogen bond donor in the quinone binding region results in increased activity. Similar studies with the chimeric Hsp90 inhibitors, radester and radanamycin, further supported this finding, suggesting that the hydroquinone is more active in vitro. 7 – 9 This observation was later confirmed by researchers at Infinity Pharmaceuticals who identified the hydroquinone of GDA as the active form in vivo. 10 These initial findings suggest that modifications to the quinone moiety may provide analogues that demonstrate improved activity and decreased toxicity. Santi and co-workers recently reported the co-crystal structure of 17-dimethylaminoethylamino geldanamycin (DMAG) bound to Hsp90 and performed a series of computational studies to understand the relationship between the bent conformation of GDA present in the ATP binding site versus its native conformation. 11 Their studies suggest that GDA binds Hsp90 and is twisted into a bent conformation by isomerization of the amide bond ( trans ? cis ), which results in an entropic penalty between 2.2 and 6.4 kcal/mol. They further suggested that analogues of GDA that contain a cis -amide could exhibit >1000-fold increase in Hsp90 affinity. In contrast to GDA, RDC binds Hsp90 in a bent conformation identical to its native conformation and exhibits little entropic penalty. 5 Therefore, conformationally biased inhibitors that contain an ?, ? -unsaturated amide bond in either a cis or trans orientation represent inhibitors that are predisposed to a bent conformation and may exhibit improved inhibition. In this article, we describe the synthesis of saturated and unsaturated cis / trans ?, ? -unsaturated amides that incorporate quinone mimics along with their inhibitory activities.  Results and Discussion Chemistry The first series of radamide analogues prepared and evaluated were derivatives incorporating varying saturated alkyl linkers between the resorcinol and quinone moieties ( Scheme 1 ). The hydroquinone and quinone analogues were prepared as previously described for radamide 6 and radanamycin 9 with minor modification ( Scheme 1 ). Briefly, silyl protection and chlorination of 2,4-dihydroxy-5-methyl benzoate gave the fully protected resorcinolic ester 1 , which was used as an intermediate for subsequent analogues. Alkylation of 1 with appropriate alkenyl bromides and LDA furnished alkenes 2 – 4 . Conversion of the terminal olefins to the corresponding carboxylic acids ( 8 – 10 ) and subsequent EDCI/DMAP-catalyzed coupling with the MOM-protected aniline 6 gave protected amides 12 – 14 . Deprotection of the resorcinol phenols, followed by removal of the MOM protecting groups via in situ generated trimethylsilyl iodide afforded a 1:1 mixture of the hydroquinone/quinone. The instability of the hydroquinone at room temperature resulted in significant oxidation to the quinone during chromatographic separation. Therefore, the mixture was subjected to air oxidation in the presence of palladium acetate immediately following MOM removal to furnish quinones 21 – 23 . Quantitative conversion of the quinone to the corresponding hydroquinones ( 24 – 26 ) was achieved by stirring with excess sodium hydrosulfite in EtOAc and H2O (50:50) for 20 min at room temperature. A library of radamide analogues ( 44 – 56 ) was prepared through EDCI/DMAP coupling of acids 5 – 7 with a variety of anilines ( Schemes 2 and 3 ) chosen to probe SAR between the quinone and the ATP binding pocket. Conformationally biased radamide analogue preparation commenced via a Still–Gennari modification of a Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons (HWE) reaction of aldehyde 5 . Utilizing bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) (methoxycarbonylmethyl)phosphonate gave the cis -methyl ester 57 in good yield ( Scheme 4 ). The corresponding trans -ester was formed through homologation procedures with triethyl phosphonoacetate and aldehyde 5 to give a 7:1 mixture of trans / cis -ethyl esters ( Scheme 5 ). The trans isomer, 63 , was easily separated via flash chromatography, and both isomers were utilized in subsequent coupling steps. Trimethyl aluminum (Me3Al)-mediated coupling of the ester and aniline 11 , followed by deprotection and oxidation/reduction steps described above, produced the cis - and trans -quinones, 61 and 68 , and hydroquinones, 62 and 69 . The anilines used for the saturated analogues were coupled to both ester isomers to furnish the respective trans ( 79a – 87a ) and cis ( 79b – 83b ) conformationally biased derivatives ( Scheme 6 ). The majority of anilines used to construct the conformationally biased amides were produced in good yields (>75%); however, the heterocyclic anilines were unreactive toward the cis -ester. In contrast, yields for the coupling of the same anilines with the trans -ester were moderate (30–48%, Table 1 ). These results suggested that orientation about the olefin was preventing attachment of the activated aniline due to steric congestion. Therefore, the corresponding cis analogues were prepared by alkylation of resorcinol 1 with propargyl bromide upon treatment with LDA to give the terminal alkyne, 88 ( Scheme 7 ). 88 was inseparable from the starting material; however, after alkylation with methyl chloroformate, the resulting propargyl ester, 89 , cleanly separated from the starting ester under normal chromatographic conditions (34% overall for the two steps). Tri-methyl aluminum-mediated coupling of the alkyne ester with the heterocyclic anilines resulted in formation of the desired amides, 90a – c , in good yields (63–85%), confirming steric congestion significantly retards this reaction. The methyl ester aniline D ( Table 1 ) required modification as described in the Experimental Section to prevent polymerization of this compound upon exposure to trimethyl aluminum. Reduced aniline activation times resulted in poor yields for cis -amide coupling. However, utilizing the alkyne ester, the desired compound 90d was furnished in excellent yield (81%). The alkyne-linked compounds 90a – d were treated with Lindlar’s catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere to give the corresponding cis isomer analogues in moderate yield. Finally, removal of the resorcinol protecting groups furnished the cis -radamide analogues 92a – d in quantitative yield. Biological Results Upon completion of the synthesis of radamide analogues 21 – 26 , 44 – 56 , 61 – 69 , 79a – 87a , 79b – 83b , and 92a – d , their antiproliferative activities against two distinct human breast cancer cell lines, an estrogen receptor positive cell line, MCF-7, and an estrogen receptor negative, Her2 overexpressing cell line, SKBr3, were determined. In addition, each compound was tested for its ability to decrease cellular levels of Her2, a Hsp90-dependent client protein involved with oncogenic signaling pathways in several types of cancer. The anilines utilized as quinone mimics ( Scheme 3 ) were chosen to take advantage of the key interactions previously described for the Hsp90 N-terminal ATP binding site. In order to establish the optimal distance between the quinone and resorcinol moieties of radamide, a series of compounds containing an increasing number of methylene units were synthesized and evaluated ( 21 – 26 and 44 – 49 ). In addition, compounds 44 – 49 were also designed to determine whether the nitrile could provide additional hydrogen bonding interactions with Lys44 and improve Hsp90 inhibitory activity. The general trend for these compounds demonstrated that increasing tether length provided an increase in antiproliferative activity against both cell lines ( Table 2 ). This was most evident when comparing the nitrile derivatives 44 – 49 , wherein each additional methylene resulted in the conversion of inactive analogues ( 44 and 47 , IC50 > 100) into analogues with IC50 values of ~30 ? M against MCF-7 cells ( Table 1 ). These results prompted the synthesis of a series of radamide analogues that contained a saturated four-carbon linker and the corresponding quinone mimics ( 50 – 56 ) that provided insight into the SAR for the quinone binding region. Analogues that contained no ( 52 ) or one ( 50 and 54 ) substituent exhibited poor antiproliferative activity, indicating the importance of having multiple interactions with the phosphate binding region. Substitution of the para -nitrile ( 46 ) with a para -methyl ester ( 50 ) resulted in two-fold decreased activity, suggesting that the nitrile at this position provides beneficial hydrogen bond acceptor properties. Comparison of the activities of compounds 46 , 49 , 51 , and 55 suggested that the pyridine/pyrazine nitrogens that were chosen to mimic the quinone oxygens are not essential for inhibitory activity when the nitrile is present. However, when absent, the pyridine nitrogens are important and may facilitate isomerization of the amide via their electron-withdrawing properties. These compounds were generally more active against MCF-7 cells, and overall, their ability to decrease Her2 levels in vitro correlated well with their antiproliferative activity against the SKBr3 cell line. Overall, the most active analogues contained the natural quinone/hydroquinone of GDA, prompting the design of a new class of radamide analogues that could demonstrate improved binding and inhibiton. Because GDA and RDC bind Hsp90 in a bent conformation, it has been proposed that analogues of these natural products predisposed to this conformation will demonstrate improved Hsp90 binding affinity and subsequently exhibit higher inhibition in vitro. 11 Conformationally biased analogues of radamide containing an ?, ? -unsaturated amide bond in either a cis or trans orientation represent a class of inhibitors predisposed to a bent conformation that were prepared and tested for their Hsp90 inhibitory activity. Surprisingly, both the cis -quinone ( 61 ) and hydroquinone ( 62 ) were significantly less active in vitro than the corresponding trans -oriented analogues (quinone, 68 , and hydroquinone, 69 ) ( Table 3 ). In addition, both the cis and trans analogues demonstrated less antiproliferative activity compared to the corresponding saturated analogue, 26 . Taken together, these data suggest that increased rigidity of both the cis and trans orientations prevents the quinone from forming hydrogen bonding interactions with Asp40 and Lys98, which are observed upon GDA binding to Hsp90. The decrease in activity exhibited by these compounds also suggests that the orientation may provide improved interactions for various quinone mimics within the binding pocket. The antiproliferative activity exhibited by the conformationally biased analogues incorporating various quinone mimics provided additional insights into the SAR for this series of compounds ( 79a – 87a , 79b – 83b , and 92a – d , Table 3 ). Similar to the saturated analogues, these compounds were generally more active against MCF-7 cells. In addition, the trans -oriented unsaturated compounds were slightly less active than the corresponding saturated quinone mimics, further supporting the SAR previously reported for both the quinone and the hydroquinone analogues. Direct comparison of the cis -and trans -oriented quinone mimics shows significant improvement in antiproliferative activity for the majority of cis compounds, suggesting that their predisposed bent conformation creates improved binding interactions with Hsp90 or, at least, less entropic penalties upon binding. Five cis analogues demonstrated comparable ( 83b , 92b , and 92d ) or improved ( 79b and 81b ) antiproliferative activity compared to the quinone/hydroquinone analogues in at least one in vitro assay. These quinone mimics also demonstrated the most potent inhibitory activity in the saturated series. Surprisingly, the cis -oriented analogue containing the para -nitrile, 79b , was completely inactive against SKBr3 cells. This result, coupled with the increased activity observed for most compounds against the MCF-7 cell line, suggests that Hsp90 found in this cell line is more susceptible to drug treatment for some unknown reason. In a more direct determination of in vitro Hsp90 inhibition, Her2 degradation, the most active analogues were the cis - and trans -quinone/hydroquinones ( 61 – 69 ), which exhibited IC50 values from ~35 to 57 ? M. On the basis of the data gathered for the radamide analogues, three compounds, 23 , 61 , and 81b , were chosen for Western blot analyses based on their ability to induce degradation of Hsp90-dependent client proteins ( Figure 3 ). Compounds 23 and 61 were chosen because they represent the most potent analogues from their respective series in both antiproliferative and Her2 degradation assays. Because these analogues contain the natural quinone, 81b was also chosen for analysis as the most active cis -radamide analogue containing a quinone mimic (2,4,5-trifluoroaniline). Each compound induced degradation of Hsp90 client proteins in a concentration-dependent fashion and produced IC50 values that correspond well with antiproliferative and Her2 results. Similar to results obtained for the antiproliferative and Her2 assays, the saturated four-carbon quinone 23 was most active and produced IC50 values of ~25 ? M. Both 61 and 81b were less active, with IC50 values of ~50–100 ? M.  Chemistry The first series of radamide analogues prepared and evaluated were derivatives incorporating varying saturated alkyl linkers between the resorcinol and quinone moieties ( Scheme 1 ).

Both 61 and 81b were less active, with IC50 values of ~50–100 ? M.  Conclusion Analogues of radamide, a chimeric Hsp90 inhibitor that contains the quinone ring of GDA and the resorcinol moiety of RDC linked through an amide bond, were prepared and evaluated. Increasing the length of the saturated chain analogues to four carbons resulted in increased activity for all analogues evaluated. Derivatives containing quinone mimics designed to investigate the importance of the various positions of the aromatic ring were generally less active than the natural quinone, highlighting its importance for optimal Hsp90 inhibitory activity. A series of cis -radamide analogues that are conformationally predisposed to adopt the cup shape necessary for high-affinity binding to the N-terminal ATP binding site were also designed, synthesized, and evaluated for Hsp90 inhibition. While these analogues demonstrated reduced Hsp90 inhibitory activity, several analogues were more active in antiproliferation assays, suggesting the potential for an alternative target for cis analogues. The design and synthesis of novel chimeric analogues that are conformationally biased toward the bent cup-shaped conformation is currently underway and will be reported in due course.
