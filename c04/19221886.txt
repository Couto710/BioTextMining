Role of endothelial progenitors and other bone marrow-derived cells in the development of the tumor vasculature Increasing evidence suggests the importance of bone marrow-derived cells for blood vessel formation (neovascularization) in tumors, which can occur in two mechanisms: angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Angiogenesis results from proliferation and sprouting of existing blood vessels close to the tumor, while vasculogenesis is believed to arise from recruitment of circulating cells, largely derived from the bone marrow, and de novo clonal formation of blood vessels from these cells. Although bone marrow-derived cells are crucial for neovascularization, current evidence suggests a promotional role of these cells on the existing blood vessels rather than de novo neovascularization in tumors. This is believed to be due to the highly proangiogenic features of these cells. The bone marrow-derived cells are heterogeneous, consisting of many different cell types including endothelial progenitor cells, myeloid cells, lymphocytes, and mesenchymal cells. These cells are highly orchestrated under the influence of the specific tumor microenvironment, which varies depending on the tumor type, thereby tightly regulating neovascularization in the tumors. In this review, we high-light some of the recent findings on each of these cell types by outlining some of the essential proangiogenic cytokines that these cells secrete to promote tumor angiogenesis and vasculogenesis.  Conclusions In this review, we have highlighted some of the recent findings on the role of bone marrow-derived cells and their proangiogenic cytokines for new blood vessel formation in tumors. Convincing evidence indicates a critical role played by bone marrow-derived cells in promoting tumor angiogenesis and progression. This suggests that solid tumors have the capability of modulating their tumor environment such that infiltrating immune cells favor, rather than inhibit tumor growth. Molecular mechanisms by which the bone marrow-derived cells promote tumor angiogenesis are not well-understood. This is largely because of the heterogeneity of the bone marrow-derived cells and the complex nature of these cells including the diverse interactions occurring among them. But, this is an exciting time for this field because of the development of powerful genetic mouse models as wells as the availability of specifically targeted therapies against each population of the bone marrow-derived cells. This will enable future studies to dissect out the critical players promoting tumor angiogenesis as well as develop new anticancer strategies.
