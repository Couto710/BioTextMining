Ethnic Differences in Symptoms Experienced During the Menopausal Transition Our purpose in this study was to explore ethnic differences in symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition among four major ethnic groups in the U.S. using a feminist perspective. This was a cross-sectional correlational study among 158 midlife women. The instruments included are: questions on sociodemographic characteristics, health, and menopausal status, and the Midlife Women’s Symptom Index. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Significant ethnic differences in the total number of symptoms ( p <.01) were found. The most frequently reported symptoms differed by ethnicity. The symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition were significantly associated with some contextual factors.  Instruments Both Internet and pen-and-pencil (PP) format of the questionnaires were used, depending on the recruitment settings. Both formats were comprised of self-administered questions on six sociodemographic characteristics, health, and menopausal status, and the MSI. There were no significant differences in the reliability and validity between the Internet questionnaire and the PP questionnaire (Author, 2005). Detailed information on each instrument is as follows. Sociodemographic characteristics The questions on sociodemographic characteristics included 8 questions on age, education, religion, marital status, employment status, family income, self-reported ethnic identity (ethnic group membership), and country of birth. Self-reported health and menopausal status The questions on self-reported health and menopausal status included a 5-point Likert scale item rating general health (1 item); 2 open-ended questions on diagnosed diseases and medicine (2 items); 7 items asking last menstrual cycle, menstrual regularity, and menstrual flow (7 items); and 1 question on steroid and hormone usage. Symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition The Midlife Women’s Symptom Index (MSI) ( Im, 2006 ) was used to measure symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition. The MSI was developed based on the Cornell Medical Index ( Brodman et al., 1956 ), which has a 195-item dichotomous scale and is divided into 18 sections including physiological symptoms and psychological symptoms. For the menopausal study by Im, Meleis, & Lee (1999) , the CMI was modified to include additional 14 questions on menopause specific symptoms reported in previous menopausal studies among both Western and Asian populations ( Blatt et al., 1953 ; Im, 1994 ; Neugarten & Kraines, 1965 ), and to exclude questions on family history of diseases. Nevertheless, the modified CMI still included non-symptom questions and tended to be too long (164 items). Thus, the modified CMI was again refined based on recent studies on symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition ( Avis et al., 2001 ; Mitchell & Woods, 1996 ; Sowers et al., 2003 ), recent menopause-specific instruments (the SWAN study instrument and the WWHD), and reviews of an expert panel (8 experts in the area of women’s health), which resulted in the MSI ( Im, 2006 ). The MSI includes a total number of 88 dichotomous items, and categorizes the items into physical, psychological, and psychosomatic.

The MSI includes a total number of 88 dichotomous items, and categorizes the items into physical, psychological, and psychosomatic.  Data Collection Procedures The study was approved by the Internet Review Board of the institution where the researchers are affiliated. For the women who were recruited through real settings, when a potential participant contacted the researcher by phone or email, her eligibility for the study was checked. When she met the inclusion criteria, the informed consent form and the PP survey questionnaire were mailed or delivered in person to her. Then, she was asked to review and sign the consent form, self-administer the questionnaire, and return the signed consent form and the questionnaire by mail or in person. For the women who were recruited through the Internet, a project website was developed and maintained in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations on patient anonymity and the online security recommendations of the SysAdmin Audit, Network, and Security Institute and Federal Bureau of Investigations (SANS/FBI). When a potential participant visited the project website, she was asked to review the digital informed consent sheet and give her consent by clicking the button of “I agree to participate.” When she clicked the button, her eligibility was checked with several screening questions related to the inclusion criteria. Then, only those who met the inclusion criteria were automatically forwarded to the Internet survey webpage and asked to fill out the questionnaire there.  Data Management and Analysis The data were saved in ASCII format in CD ROMs, which conforms to the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) data format. No individual identities were used throughout the data management and analysis process; only serial ID numbers (assigned by the researchers) were attached to the data. The data were confidentially dealt with and maintained in a locked file cabinet in a research office. If missing fields were less than 10%, the missing data were substituted with means for continuous variables and “999” for categorical variables. The data of the women for whom 10% or more data were missing and who did not enter their answer for the question on self-reported ethnic identity were not included in the data analysis. Data were analyzed using the SPSS. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported health and menopausal status, and self-reported symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition were described using frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, and range. Also, total scores of the MSI were calculated and analyzed using mean and standard deviation. Then, to explore ethnic differences in symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition, the data were analyzed using ANOVA. The associations between symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition and other contextual factors were analyzed using correlation analyses, chi-square tests, and ANOVA tests. The associations between continuous variables and the total numbers of symptoms, physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, and psychosomatic symptoms (continuous variables) were analyzed using correlation analyses. The associations between categorical variables with more than two categories and the total numbers of symptoms, physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, and psychosomatic symptoms were analyzed using ANOVA. The associations between categorical variables and each symptom included in the MSI (dichotomous variables) were analyzed using chi-square tests.  Methods For this study, a cross-sectional correlational design was used. Settings and Participants Using a convenience sampling method, a total of 158 middle-aged women aged 40 to 60 years who could read and write English were recruited through both Internet and community settings including 20 Internet communities/groups for midlife women that were identified through Google search, shopping malls, hair salons, and ethnic churches. The study announcement distributed and/or posted on both settings included general information about the study and information on contact numbers, e-mail address, and the dates data were collected. The reason for recruiting the participants online was to reach mid-life women from a broader geographical range nationally. The women recruited through the community settings and those recruited through the Internet settings were not statistically significantly different in their selected sociodemographic characteristics (age, education, family income, and hormone usage). Sociodemographic characteristics of the 158 women are summarized in Table 1 . With a medium effect size ( f =0.20) and an alpha of 0.05, 120 subjects are required to achieve a power of 0.86 in ANOVA. Based on the previous studies ( Grisso et al., 1999 ; Laferrere et al., 2002 ; Lovejoy et al., 2001 ; McCarthy, 1994 ; McCrohon et al., 2000 ; Parfitt et al., 1997 ; Probst-Hensch et al., 2000 ; Wilbur et al., 1998 ), a medium effect size of 0.20 was assumed in the study. Thus, the sample size of 158 is adequate to describe and explore ethnic differences in symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition.

Sociodemographic characteristics of the 158 women are summarized in Table 1 . With a medium effect size ( f =0.20) and an alpha of 0.05, 120 subjects are required to achieve a power of 0.86 in ANOVA. Based on the previous studies ( Grisso et al., 1999 ; Laferrere et al., 2002 ; Lovejoy et al., 2001 ; McCarthy, 1994 ; McCrohon et al., 2000 ; Parfitt et al., 1997 ; Probst-Hensch et al., 2000 ; Wilbur et al., 1998 ), a medium effect size of 0.20 was assumed in the study. Thus, the sample size of 158 is adequate to describe and explore ethnic differences in symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition.  Findings Symptoms The mean total number of total symptoms was 23.34 ( SD =13.65); that of physical symptoms was 13.23 ( SD =7.58); that of psychological symptoms was 6.88 ( SD =5.65); and that of psychosomatic symptoms was 1.83 ( SD =1.83). The mean total number of total symptoms was 23.86 ( SD =13.75) among White women, 31.0 ( SD =13.70) among African American women, 17.75 ( SD =13.15) among Asian American women, and 27.56 ( SD =13.63) among Hispanic women. The mean total number of physical symptoms was 13.74 ( SD =7.66) among White women, 17.0 ( SD =7.63) among African American women, 10.15 ( SD =.7.15) among Asian American women, 13.70 ( SD =7.74) among Hispanic women. The mean total number of psychological symptoms was 7.12 ( SD =5.80) among White women, 5.70 ( SD =3.56) among African American women, 5.20 ( SD =4.43) among Asian American women, and 8.26 ( SD =6.74) among Hispanic women. The mean total number of psychosomatic symptoms was 1.84 ( SD =1.29) among White women, 4.00 ( SD =1.22) among African American women, 1.40 ( SD =1.77) among Asian American women, and 2.20 ( SD =1.03) among Hispanic women. The most frequently reported symptoms across ethnic groups include “allergy symptoms” (64%), “changes in vision” (61%), “feeling hot or cold” (61%), “forgetfulness” (61%), “sleep difficulty” (54%), and “stiff and sore joints” (52%). The most frequently reported symptoms according to ethnic groups are summarized in Table 2 . Ethnic Differences in Symptoms The ANOVA tests indicated that there was no statistical significant difference in the total number of total symptoms, physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, and psychosomatic symptoms according to ethnic identity. However, the chi-square tests indicated that there were significant associations between the frequencies of the following symptoms and the ethnicity of the participants: “feeling hot or cold” (?2=22.55, p <.01), “tense or jumpy during period” (?2=40.08, p <.01), “hot flushes” (?2=14.42, p <.01), “frequent urination” (?2=12.33, p <.01), and “feeling grouchy” (?2=21.40, p =.01). Other Correlates of Symptoms A correlation analysis indicated that there were no significant associations between age and the total number of total symptoms, physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, and psychosomatic symptoms. However, the ANOVA tests indicated that the symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition were significantly different according to several contextual variables. First, according to income satisfaction, there were significant differences in total number of total symptoms ( F =8.39, p <.01) and physical symptoms ( F =8.42, p <.01). Post-hoc tests could not be conducted because only two income groups had an adequate number of participants for the post-hoc comparisons. In terms of self-reported health status, there were significant differences in total number of psychological symptoms ( F =6.37, p <.01). The women who reported “excellent” or “very good” health status had a lower number of psychological symptoms compared with the women who reported “fair” health status. When chi-square tests were conducted to determine the associations between each of the symptoms included in the MSI (dichotomous variables) and categorical sociodemographic characteristics, significant associations between some symptoms and the following variables were found (please see Table 3 ): (a) income satisfaction; (b) education; (c) marital status; (d) religion (having a religion, or no religion); (e) birth place (US born or non-US born); (f) employment status (employed or not-employed); (g) disease status (disease or no-disease); (h) health status; (i) medication status (currently medicated or not medicated); (j) menopausal status; and (k) hysterectomy status.  Findings Symptoms The mean total number of total symptoms was 23.34 ( SD =13.65); that of physical symptoms was 13.23 ( SD =7.58); that of psychological symptoms was 6.88 ( SD =5.65); and that of psychosomatic symptoms was 1.83 ( SD =1.83).

Other Correlates of Symptoms A correlation analysis indicated that there were no significant associations between age and the total number of total symptoms, physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, and psychosomatic symptoms. However, the ANOVA tests indicated that the symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition were significantly different according to several contextual variables. First, according to income satisfaction, there were significant differences in total number of total symptoms ( F =8.39, p <.01) and physical symptoms ( F =8.42, p <.01). Post-hoc tests could not be conducted because only two income groups had an adequate number of participants for the post-hoc comparisons. In terms of self-reported health status, there were significant differences in total number of psychological symptoms ( F =6.37, p <.01). The women who reported “excellent” or “very good” health status had a lower number of psychological symptoms compared with the women who reported “fair” health status. When chi-square tests were conducted to determine the associations between each of the symptoms included in the MSI (dichotomous variables) and categorical sociodemographic characteristics, significant associations between some symptoms and the following variables were found (please see Table 3 ): (a) income satisfaction; (b) education; (c) marital status; (d) religion (having a religion, or no religion); (e) birth place (US born or non-US born); (f) employment status (employed or not-employed); (g) disease status (disease or no-disease); (h) health status; (i) medication status (currently medicated or not medicated); (j) menopausal status; and (k) hysterectomy status.

Discussions In the study reported in this paper, the existence of certain ethnic differences in the symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition was noted. Asian women were found to experience the smallest number of total symptoms, physical, psychological, and psychosomatic symptoms compared with all other ethnic groups, a finding that agrees with previous findings among Asian women ( Chim et al., 2002 ; Im, 1997 ; Lock, 2001 ; Pan et al., 2002 ). In addition, African American women were found to experience the largest number of total, physical, and psychosomatic symptoms compared with other ethnic groups. Despite some conflicting findings on ethnic differences in specific symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition, certain ethnic variations in the symptoms have been clearly reported in relatively recent studies among ethnically diverse groups of women ( Avis et al., 2001 ; Fu et al., 2003 ; Kravitz et al., 2003 ; Lasley et al., 2002 ; Lovejoy et al., 2001 ; McCrohon et al., 2000 ; Wilbur et al., 1998 ). In these studies, ethnic variations in vasomotor symptoms were frequently reported. Brazilian women were reported to experience highly prevalent and similar vasomotor symptoms to those reported among Western women ( Pedro et al., 2003 ); only 12 to 20 percent of Asian women were reported to experience them ( Chim et al., 2002 ; Im, 1997 ; Lock, 2001 ; Pan et al., 2002 ); and Mayan women in Mexico were reported to experience none of them at all ( Beyene & Martin, 2001 ). The findings reported in this paper were slightly different than those of previous studies. For example, studies among African American women reported that African American women tended to have hot flashes and vaginal dryness more than Caucasian women, but they tended to have urine leakage and difficulty sleeping less than Caucasians ( Gold et al., 2000 ). Yet in the study reported in this paper, there were significant ethnic differences in “hot flushes” and “frequent urination,” but not in “vaginal dryness.” The most frequently reported symptoms according to ethnic groups were also different. Across the ethnic groups, “forgetfulness” and “sleep difficulty” were included as one of the most frequently reported symptoms. As presented in the findings section, significant associations of income, education, marital status, religion, the country of birth (US born or non-US born), employment status (employed or not-employed), the disease status (disease or no-disease), health status, medication status (currently medicated or not medicated), menopausal status, and hysterectomy status to the symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition were found. These findings are similar to those of previous studies on associations of some contextual factors to symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition, although those studies tend to be limited to White women. Statistically significant correlations of symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition to multiple factors (e.g., age, educational level, socioeconomic status, employment status, number of children, diet [soy consumption], height, body size, body weight, body mass, alcohol consumption, smoking, level of physical activity, exercise, physical functioning, health status, osteoarthritis, mental illness, tubal ligation, attitudes toward menopause and aging, menopausal status, marital satisfaction, and interpersonal relationships, and usage of hormone replacement therapy and calcium supplements) have been reported in previous studies ( Avis et al., 2001 ; Barrett-Connor et al., 2000 ; Brzyski et al., 2001 ; Chim et al., 2002 ; Gold et al., 2000 ; Ho et al., 2003 ; Punyahotra et al., 1997 ; Sommer et al., 1999 ; Sowers et al., 2003 ). Yet, the findings on the associations of contextual factors to the symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition that are reported in this paper did not include information on ethnic-specific contextual factors circumscribing women’s symptom experience during the menopausal transition because of the inherent characteristics of a quantitative study design. Despite positive findings on ethnic differences in the symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition, the study presented in this paper has some limitations. The first limitation is related to authenticity of the Internet interactions among the participants recruited through the Internet (e.g., if the participants recruited online actually were midlife women in the ethnic group as they reported). Because Internet recruitment is based on non-face-to-face interactions, researchers working in this environment must rely heavily on the honesty of the participants, which might have resulted in bias. Second, although the participants were recruited nationally through the Internet recruitment process, the sampling could not be claimed to be a national sample of midlife women, which might raise questions about the generalizability of the study findings. Third, as mentioned above, the participants did not represent all the diverse ethnic subgroups of Whites, Hispanics, Asians, and African Americans in the U.S. Rather, in this study, Whites, Hispanics, Asians, and African Americans were treated as distinct ethnic groups for the convenience of comparisons. Fourth, because of the pilot descriptive nature of the study and the small sample size in some ethnic groups (e.g., only 13 African American women), contextual variables could not be controlled in the study. Finally, another limitation would be that there still might be some differences between the participants recruited through the Internet and those recruited through community settings although there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups identified in the study reported in this paper.  Discussions In the study reported in this paper, the existence of certain ethnic differences in the symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition was noted. Asian women were found to experience the smallest number of total symptoms, physical, psychological, and psychosomatic symptoms compared with all other ethnic groups, a finding that agrees with previous findings among Asian women ( Chim et al., 2002 ; Im, 1997 ; Lock, 2001 ; Pan et al., 2002 ).

Implications and Conclusions In the study presented in this paper, ethnic differences in symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition were explored among 158 mid-life women who were recruited through both Internet and community settings. In the study, significant ethnic differences in symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition and significant associations of contextual factors including sociodemographic characteristics, health, and menopausal status to the symptoms were found. Based on the findings, the following implications for future menopausal research and health care practice with ethnic minority mid-life women are proposed. First, further investigations on ethnic differences in symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition among larger multi-ethnic groups of participants are essential for developing the knowledge base on ethnic differences. With such a foundation, the health care needs of ethnic minority women in the menopausal transition can be adequately and appropriately assessed. Second, national approaches to recruit mid-life women need to be further explored and used in future research on ethnic differences in the symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition. As discussed above, a lack of national samples in menopausal studies is a major concern in research on ethnic differences in symptom experience during the menopausal transition. A larger number of multi-ethnic groups of midlife women across the nation would help develop the knowledge base on ethnic differences in the symptom experience. As the study reported in this paper indicated, Internet recruitment would make it possible for researchers to reach a large number of multi-ethnic groups of midlife women across the nation. The Internet will also allow researchers to reach midlife women in different countries for cross-cultural studies comparing the symptoms of different ethnic groups of women in different geographical areas. Finally, further qualitative investigations on ethnic-specific contextual factors influencing symptom experience during the menopausal transition of multi-ethnic groups of women are needed. In the study presented in this paper, significant associations between contextual factors and symptoms experienced during the menopausal transition were found. However, as pointed out above, the findings could not include any information on ethnic-specific contexts within which women are experiencing symptoms because of the inherent characteristics of a quantitative study design. Without knowing ethnic-specific contexts circumscribing women’s symptom experience during the menopausal transition, the health care needs of the women cannot be adequately and appropriately assessed and provided.
