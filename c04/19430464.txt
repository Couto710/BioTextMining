Haematopoietic malignancies caused by dysregulation of a chromatin-binding PHD finger Histone H3 Lys4 methylation (H3K4me) was proposed as a critical component in regulating the gene expression, epigenetic states, and cellular identities 1 . The biological meaning of H3K4me is interpreted via conserved modules including p lant h omeo d omain (PHD) fingers that recognize varied H3K4me states 1 , 2 . The dysregulation of PHD finger has been implicated in a variety of human diseases including cancers and immune or neurological disorders 3 . Here we report that fusing an H3K4-trimethylation (H3K4me3)-binding PHD finger, such as the C-terminal PHD finger of JARID1A or PHF23 (JARID1APHD3, PHF23PHD), to a common fusion partner nucleoporin-98 (NUP98) as identified in human leukemias 4 , 5 , generated potent oncoproteins that arrested hematopoietic differentiation and induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In these processes, a PHD finger that specifically recognizes H3K4me3/2 marks was essential for leukemogenesis. Mutations in PHD fingers that abrogated H3K4me3-binding also abolished leukemic transformation. NUP98-PHD fusion prevented the differentiation-associated removal of H3K4me3 at many loci encoding lineage-specific transcription factors ( Hox(s), Gata3, Meis1, Eya1, Pbx1 ), and enforced their active gene transcription. Mechanistically, NUP98-PHD fusions act as ‘chromatin boundary factors’, dominating over polycomb-mediated gene silencing to ‘lock’ developmentally crucial loci into an active chromatin state (H3K4me3 with induced histone acetylation), a state that defined leukemia stem cells. Collectively, our studies represent the first report wherein the deregulation of PHD finger, ‘effector’ of specific histone modification, perturbs the epigenetic dynamics on developmentally critical loci, catastrophizes cellular fate decision-making, and even causes oncogenesis during development.  METHODS SUMMARY Hematopoietic cell transformation assays Protocols for the culture of primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were previously described 18 .

Supplementary Material 1 2  METHODS Plasmid construction and retroviral expression system The NUP98-JARID1A fusion cDNA 4 was generated by ligating NUP98 sequences encoding amino acids 1-514 to those encoding amino acids 1489-1690 of JARID1A transcript variant 1 (NCBI accession No. NM_001042603) or amino acids 1489-1641 of JARID1A transcript variant 2 (NCBI accession No. NM_005056), producing two fusion isoforms (NJL or NJS) respectively. The same method was used to generate NUP98-PHF23 5 . The fusion cDNA with an N-terminal 3xFLAG was cloned into MSCV retroviral expression vector (Clontech). JARID1A (RBP2), PHF23 and BHC80 cDNAs were purchased from Open Biosystems. NUP98 plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. J.M. van Deursen, Hoxa9 by Dr. M.P. Kamps, MLL-ENL by Dr. R.K. Slany, Yng1 by Dr. S.D. Taverna, CBX7 by Dr. E. Bernstein, and ING2 by Dr. Z. Tang. Mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, and all used plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Purification and culture of primary hematopoietic cells Bone marrow cells harvested from femur and tibia of balb/C or b/6 mice were subject to lineage-negative (Lin-) enrichment using Hematopoietic Progenitor Enrichment Kit (StemCell Technologies or Miltenyi Biotec) to remove cells expressing differentiation antigens as described before 16 . ?400,000 of Lin- enriched hematopoietic progenitors were obtained per mouse with ?10% c-Kit+Lin-Sca1+ HSCs. Before retroviral infection, Lin--enriched hematopoietic progenitors were stimulated in OptiMEM base medium (Invitrogen, cat#31985) complemented with 10% of FBS (Invitrogen, cat#16000-044), 1% of antibiotics, 50?M of ?-mercaptoethanol and a cytokine cocktail containing SCF (supernatant of SCF-producer cells), 5ng/mL FLT3 ligand (Sigma), 5ng/mL IL3 and IL6 (Miltenyi) for 2-3 days as described 18 , 31 . After retroviral infection and selection (1?g/mL puromycin), marrow cells were plated in the same medium with SCF as the sole cytokine. Cell splitting and replating to fresh medium were performed every 3-4 days to keep cell number <2 million per well (6- or 12-well plate). Cell morphology was examined by Wright-Giemsa staining. Macrophages were obtained by culture of marrow cells in M-CSF (Miltenyi) for 1-2 weeks as described 32 ; Immortalized cell lines that mimic committed neutrophil-macrophage progenitors were generated as described before 18 , 31 , 33 . Murine bone marrow transplantation leukemogenic assay Leukemogenic potentials of oncogenes were evaluated in sublethally irradiated syngeneic mice after tail vein injection with 100,000 of bone marrow-derived Lin- cells that were infected with retrovirus encoding the fusion gene as described 18 . Mice exhibiting leukemic phenotype were subjected to pathological analyses. Recombinant protein production and GST pull-down JARID1APHD3 (amino acids 1601-1660) GST-fusion proteins were produced using a previously described protocol 19 . GST pull-down using total histone extracts was performed as described with modification 9 . Briefly, ?2?g GST-fusion protein bound to glutathione beads (Amersham) were incubated with 10?g of calf thymus histone extracts (Worthington) in a binding buffer containing 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.2mM EDTA, 1mM DTT and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) at 4°C for 4 h. Native co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) Mononucleosomes-containing fractions were prepared as described before 6 . Briefly, intact nuclei were subject to limited micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion so that the major form of released chromatin is mononucleosome. After the removal of insoluble fraction by centrifugation, supernatant containing mononucleosomes was then incubated with FLAG or HA-agarose beads (Sigma), or with Dynal magnetic beads (Invitrogen) coupled with ?H3K4me3 (Abcam) or control antibodies. After extensive washing, precipitated proteins were subject to immunoblot. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements Calorimetric experiments were conducted at 25.0°C with an MicroCal iTC200 instrument (Northampton, MA) as described 7 . Recombinant JARID1APHD3 protein and H31-15K4me peptides were dialyzed overnight against 25mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 50mM KCl, and 2mM ?-mercatoethanol. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance spectroscopy (Tyr ?280=1,420 M-1cm-1; Trp ?280=5,600 M-1cm-1; Cys ?280=125 M-1 cm-1). H31-15K4me peptides were quantified by the absorbance of an added C-terminal Tyr with ?280=1,280 M-1cm-1 for peptide. Acquired calorimetric titration data were analyzed using software Origin7.0 (MicroCal, LLC ITC 200) based on a 1:1 binding stoichiometry. Antibodies and immunoblot Antibodies used were ?-FLAG (Sigma; M2), ?-HA (Covance, MMS101), ?-Hoxa9 (Upstate, 07-178), ?-Pbx1 (Santa Cruz, sc889), ?-phosph-c-Kit (Cell signaling) and ?-Tubulin (Sigma). ChIP analysis ChIP analysis was performed using Upstate ChIP kit and a protocol described before 34 . 1?2 million cells per ChIP were used for histones, and 2?3 million for others. Antibodies and amount used were ?-Flag (Sigma M2, 1-3?g), ?-HA (Covance MMS101, 1-3?g), ?-H3K4me3 (Upstate 07-473, 1?L; Abcam 8580, 0.5?g), ?-H3K27me3 (Upstate 07-449, 0.5?g), ?-acetyl-H3 (Upstate 06-599, 1?g), ?-general H3 (Abcam 1791, 0.5?g), ?-acetyl-H3K9 (Upstate 06-942, 1?g), ?-acetyl-H3K27 (Abcam 4729, 1?g), ?-Ezh2 (Cell signaling 4905, 4-5ul), ?-Suz12 (Upstate 07-379, 2ul), ?-MLL2 (Bethyl A300-113A, 4?g), ?-WDR5 (Upstate 07-706, 2?g), ?-RBBP5 (Bethyl A300-109A, 3?g; a gift of Dr. Christina Hughes) and ?-p300 (Santa Cruz, N15/C20, 10?g). The same amount of nonspecific IgG (Upstate) was used as antibody control, and a silenced intragenic locus, Chr8Int, as locus control for H3K4me3 or activator binding as described 21 . The promoter sequence was acquired from UCSC genomic browser ( http://genome.ucsc.edu ). ChIP primers were shown in Supplementary Table 5 . ChIP signals were represented in the percentage (%) of signals from total chromatin used, and fold of enrichment calculated by normalizing against signals of nonspecific IgG. Microarray analysis Total RNA was extracted and the transcript expression quantified using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse arrays as described 18 . RNA hybridization, scanning and signal quantification were performed by RU Gemonic Resources Center. Hybridization signals were retrieved and normalized, followed by differential expression analysis and statistical analysis using GeneSpring Analysis Platform GX 7.0 (Agilent Technologies). RT-PCR analysis Reverse transcription of RNA was performed using the random hexamer and Invitrogen Superscript III kit. Usually the PCR amplicon (size ?90-200bp) is designed to span over large intron regions. Exon-intron information was obtained from UCSC genomic browser. Quantitative PCR was performed in triplicate using SYBR green master mix reagent (Applied Biosystem) on a Stratagene Mx3005P QPCR system. Primer information is shown in Supplementary Table 5 . Flow cytometry (FACS) Cells were blocked with BD FcBlock (2.4G2) and stained on ice with fluro-conjugated antibodies (1:1,000 dilution of Cd117FITC, Sca-IPE:CY7, Cd34APC, Cd34FITC, Cd11bAPC, Gr-1PE, Cd19PE or B220PE, BD Biosciences) and analyzed on BD FACSCalibor cytometer. Data was collected and analyzed using CellQuestPro and FlowJo software. Immunofluorescence microscopy Suspension cultured hematopoietic cells were attached to cover slips treated with 0.01% (w/v) poly-lysine, followed by 15-minute fixation in 4% of parafomaldehyde and 10-min solubilization in PBS, 0.2% Triton-X100 and 0.2% NP-40. After a 30-min block in PBS, 2.5% BSA and 10% normal goat serum, cells were stained with primary antibodies (M2 ?-FLAG [1:1,000?2,000 dilution of 1mg/mL], rabbit ?-H3K4me3 [Upstate 07-473 or Abcam 8580, 1:2,000] or rabbit ?-H3K9me3 antibodies [Upstate 07-442, 1:1,000]) followed by washing and staining with fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies. After washing, fluorescent signal was visualized and analyzed with a DeltaVision Image Restoration Microscope and a Cofocal Microscope (Applied Precision/Olympus). Deconvolution microscopy image analysis was performed to reassign the out-of-focus blurred light to its origin 35 , and subcellular co-localization analysis was carried out from stacks of deconvolved images using ImageJ (Rasband WS, et al. NIH, Bethesda, USA; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ ) and the plugin JACoP 36 . Confocal microscopy analysis was performed as previously described 37 . Co-immunostaining statistics was analyzed using Pearson’s Coefficient of Correlation method. Image acquisition, processing and analyses were performed with the expert help from RU Bio-Imaging Center, and detailed protocols are available upon request. Statistics All results are presented as the mean and standard deviation (s.d). Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t-test. Protein preparation for structural studies The gene fragment encoding JARID1APHD3 was fused to the C-terminus of a His(6x)-SUMO tag in a modified pRSFDuet-1 vector (Novagen), with a ubiquitin-like-protease (ULP) cleavage site located at the linker region. The bacterial expressed protein was purified using a Ni-NTA affinity column, followed by ULP cleavage, separation of JARID1APHD3 from His(6x)-SUMO via a second Ni-NTA chromatography step, and gel filtration. The JARIPD1APHD3-H3K4me3 complex was obtained by mixing JARIPD1APHD3 protein with an equal molar amount of H31-9K4me3 peptides (H3 amino acids 1-9, with Lys4 tri-methylated), then purified by gel filtration, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Crystal growth The crystals of JARIPD1APHD3-H3K4me3 complexes were obtained by equilibrating a reservoir consisting of 20% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether 2000, 10mM nickel (II) chloride hexahydrate, and 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5) with a hanging drop consisting of 1 ? L of the reservoir solution and 1 ? L of a 27 mg/mL protein solution in 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 5mM DTT and 50 mM NaCl (Crystal Screen 2 kit, Hampton Research). A mixture of the well solution with 10% (v/v) glycerol was used as cryoprotectant. Data collection and structure determination An anomalous diffraction data set for JARID1APHD3-H31-9K4me3 complex was collected at the zinc anomalous peak wavelength (1.28215 Å) at beamline NE-CAT 24ID-C, Advanced Photon Source, Chicago. The data set was indexed, integrated and merged to 2.2 Å using the program HKL2000. The crystal belongs to I41 space group and contains one molecule per asymmetric unit. Heavy-atom search, SAD phasing and model building were performed with the PHENIX 38 software package. Three zinc atoms were unambiguously identified for SAD phasing, and ?90% residues of the protein-peptide complex were successfully built into the initial model. The PHENIX-model was further manually rebuilt using COOT 39 and refined using REFMAC5 40 in successive cycles. The final refined structure has Rwork and Rfree values of 0.200 and 0.234, respectively ( Supplementary Table 2 ). One molecule forms a domain-swapped dimer with a crystallographic symmetry-related molecule ( Supplementary Fig. 5a ). The swapped segment spans the first 14 residues from the N-terminus. Using a crystal of the complex following pH optimization of crystallization conditions, we were able to collect one 1.9 Å data set at wavelength 0.97949 Å at the same beamline. The crystal belongs to the same crystal form as the previous one. We solved the high-resolution structure by molecular replacement using PHASER 41 with the above 2.2 Å model after removing all the water molecules and some flexible residues. Structure refinement was done using CNSsolve 42 , cycled with manual model building in COOT. Prior to the refinement, the same Rfree set of reflections were transferred from the low-resolution data using the program Freerflag in CCP4 suite 43 for effective cross validation. For both data sets, ?10% reflections were selected in a ‘random’ mode throughout the resolution range. After resetting the overall B-factor to 20 Å2 and rigid body refinement, simulated annealing starting at 5,000 K was performed to reduce model bias before extensive B-factor and positional refinement. The final model contains full length JARID1APHD3 (1609-1659) with one additional serine at the N-terminus from the expression vector, histone H31-8K4me3, three zinc ions and thirty-two water molecules. The JARID1APHD3-H3K4me3 complex in the crystal shows that one molecule forms a domain-swapped dimmer with a crystallographically symmetry-related molecule ( Supplementary Fig. 5a ). Two zinc ions are integral to the folding of the PHD finger, while the third zinc ion locates at the interface between two domain-swapped dimers, thereby mediating crystal packing ( Supplementary Fig. 5c ). The Rwork and Rfree of the final structure are 0.208 and 0.225 respectively ( Supplementary Table 2 ). Isotopic labeling, NMR data collection and structure determination Samples used for NMR chemical shift assignments, 15N relaxation measurements, and structure determination contained 0.2-0.5 mM uniformly-[15N]- or [13C, 15N]-labeled JARID1APHD3 in the free state and in complex with unlabeled H31-9K4me3 peptide dissolved in NMR buffer (20 mM Na-phosphate, 1 mM ZnCl2, 5 mM DTT, 90% H2O/10% D2O) at pH 7.0. The sample used for measurements of 15N-1H residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) contained 0.2 mM JARID1APHD3 aligned in 12 mg/ml of bacteriophage Pf1 (Alsa, Riga, Latvia), 10 mM MOPS, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.0. All NMR spectra were collected at the New York Structural Biology Center (NYSBC) using 800 MHz Bruker NMR spectrometers equipped with 1H, 15N, 13C triple-resonance cryogenic probes. Unless indicated otherwise, the sample temperature was controlled at 20°C. A suite of 3D heteronuclear NMR experiments, including HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HBHA(CO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY were acquired for sequential backbone and non-aromatic side chain assignments of JARIPD1APHD3 both in the free state and in complex with H31-9K4me3 peptide in solution. 2D NOESY ( ? mix = 100 ms), 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC ( ? mix = 100 ms), 3D aromatic 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC ( ? mix = 100 ms) and 3D aliphatic 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC ( ? mix = 100 ms) data sets were acquired and used for additional assignments (side chain amide and aromatic groups) and distance constraints. To selectively observe the NOEs between JARIPD1APHD3 and H31-9K4me3 peptide, a [13C,15N]-filtered,13C-edited NOESY ( ? mix = 120 ms) spectrum 44 of uniformly [15N,13C]-labeled JARIPD1APHD3 bound to unlabeled H31-9K4me3 peptide was recorded. One-bond N-H RDCs were determined by using the IPAP 15N-HSQC sequence at 25°C 45 . Standard pulse sequences 46 were used for measurements of the 15N relaxation rates ( R 1, R 2) of JARIPD1APHD3 at 25°C. The spectra were processed and analyzed, respectively, with the NMRPipe 47 and Sparky ( http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky ) software. The solution structures of JARIPD1APHD3 both in the free state and in complex with H31-9K4me3 peptide were first calculated using the CYANA program 48 . Interproton distance constraints were derived from 2D NOESY, 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and 3D 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra. Backbone ? and ? angles were derived from TALOS-based analysis of backbone chemical shifts 49 . A number of hydrogen bonds derived from chemical shift analysis and from observed NOEs characteristic for ? -helices and ? -sheets, were added in the final rounds of structure refinement. Of the 100 final structures calculated by CYANA, 20 structures with the lowest target functions were chosen for further refinement using the Xplor-NIH program 50 , in which 1 D NH RDC restraints, physical force field terms and explicit solvent terms 51 were added to the calculation. The final structures were validated by Procheck-NMR 52 , and the statistics for the 20 final structures are listed in Supplementary Table 3 . Monomeric state of JARID1A<sub>PHD3</sub> in free and H3<sub>1-9</sub>K4me3-bound states in solution The oligomeric states of JARID1APHD3 (mol. wt. 5.8 kD) and JARID1APHD3-H31-9K4me3 complex (mol. wt. 6.8 kD) were first evaluated by comparing their elution volumes on a Superdex G75 16/60 column, with the calibration line derived from a number of molecular standards. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 7a , the elution volumes of both free JARID1APHD3 and JARID1APHD3-H31-9K4me3 complex are comparable with those expected for their monomeric states, but considerably larger that those expected for their dimeric states. This suggests that JARID1APHD3 is monomeric in solution, for both the free and H31-9K4me3 states. Furthermore, the rotational correlation times of JARID1APHD3 in the free and H31-9K4me3-bound states were estimated as 3.5 ns and 4.5 ns, respectively, based on an analysis of 15N R2/R1 relaxation time ratios ( Supplementary Fig. 7b ) using the quadratic diffusion program 53 . These values are consistent with isotropic tumbling values of a monomeric protein of their respective sizes, further supporting that both free and complexed JARID1APHD3 exist as monomers in solution. Thus, although JARID1APHD3-H3K4me3 complex exhibits a domain-swapped dimer in the crystal, gel filtration and NMR relaxation measurements ( Supplementary Figure 7 ) clearly showed such a complex to be monomeric in solution. Hence the domain-swapped dimerization observed in the crystal is likely to be a characteristic feature of the crystalline state, originating perhaps in packing interactions. 31 Wang GG Quantitative production of macrophages or neutrophils ex vivo using conditional Hoxb8 Nat Methods 2006 3 287 93 16554834 32 Sawka-Verhelle D PE-1/METS, an antiproliferative Ets repressor factor, is induced by CREB-1/CREM-1 during macrophage differentiation J Biol Chem 2004 279 17772 84 14754893 33 Calvo KR Sykes DB Pasillas M Kamps MP Hoxa9 immortalizes a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-dependent promyelocyte capable of biphenotypic differentiation to neutrophils or macrophages, independent of enforced meis expression Mol Cell Biol 2000 20 3274 85 10757811 34 Okada Y hDOT1L links histone methylation to leukemogenesis Cell 2005 121 167 78 15851025 35 Wallace W Schaefer LH Swedlow JR A workingperson’s guide to deconvolution in light microscopy Biotechniques 2001 31 1076 8 1080 1082 passim 11730015 36 Bolte S Cordelieres FP A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy J Microsc 2006 224 213 32 17210054 37 Fischle W Regulation of HP1-chromatin binding by histone H3 methylation and phosphorylation Nature 2005 438 1116 22 16222246 38 Adams PD PHENIX: building new software for automated crystallographic structure determination Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 2002 58 1948 54 12393927 39 Emsley P Cowtan K Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 2004 60 2126 32 15572765 40 Murshudov GN Vagin AA Dodson EJ Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 1997 53 240 55 15299926 41 McCoy AJ Solving structures of protein complexes by molecular replacement with Phaser Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 2007 63 32 41 17164524 42 Brunger AT Version 1.2 of the Crystallography and NMR system Nat Protoc 2007 2 2728 33 18007608 43 The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 1994 50 760 3 15299374 44 Zwahlen C Methods for Measurement of Intermolecular NOEs by Multinuclear NMR Spectroscopy: Application to a Bacteriophage gamma N-Peptide/boxB RNA Complex J.

After the removal of insoluble fraction by centrifugation, supernatant containing mononucleosomes was then incubated with FLAG or HA-agarose beads (Sigma), or with Dynal magnetic beads (Invitrogen) coupled with ?H3K4me3 (Abcam) or control antibodies. After extensive washing, precipitated proteins were subject to immunoblot.  Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements Calorimetric experiments were conducted at 25.0°C with an MicroCal iTC200 instrument (Northampton, MA) as described 7 . Recombinant JARID1APHD3 protein and H31-15K4me peptides were dialyzed overnight against 25mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 50mM KCl, and 2mM ?-mercatoethanol. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance spectroscopy (Tyr ?280=1,420 M-1cm-1; Trp ?280=5,600 M-1cm-1; Cys ?280=125 M-1 cm-1). H31-15K4me peptides were quantified by the absorbance of an added C-terminal Tyr with ?280=1,280 M-1cm-1 for peptide. Acquired calorimetric titration data were analyzed using software Origin7.0 (MicroCal, LLC ITC 200) based on a 1:1 binding stoichiometry.  Antibodies and immunoblot Antibodies used were ?-FLAG (Sigma; M2), ?-HA (Covance, MMS101), ?-Hoxa9 (Upstate, 07-178), ?-Pbx1 (Santa Cruz, sc889), ?-phosph-c-Kit (Cell signaling) and ?-Tubulin (Sigma).  ChIP analysis ChIP analysis was performed using Upstate ChIP kit and a protocol described before 34 . 1?2 million cells per ChIP were used for histones, and 2?3 million for others. Antibodies and amount used were ?-Flag (Sigma M2, 1-3?g), ?-HA (Covance MMS101, 1-3?g), ?-H3K4me3 (Upstate 07-473, 1?L; Abcam 8580, 0.5?g), ?-H3K27me3 (Upstate 07-449, 0.5?g), ?-acetyl-H3 (Upstate 06-599, 1?g), ?-general H3 (Abcam 1791, 0.5?g), ?-acetyl-H3K9 (Upstate 06-942, 1?g), ?-acetyl-H3K27 (Abcam 4729, 1?g), ?-Ezh2 (Cell signaling 4905, 4-5ul), ?-Suz12 (Upstate 07-379, 2ul), ?-MLL2 (Bethyl A300-113A, 4?g), ?-WDR5 (Upstate 07-706, 2?g), ?-RBBP5 (Bethyl A300-109A, 3?g; a gift of Dr. Christina Hughes) and ?-p300 (Santa Cruz, N15/C20, 10?g). The same amount of nonspecific IgG (Upstate) was used as antibody control, and a silenced intragenic locus, Chr8Int, as locus control for H3K4me3 or activator binding as described 21 . The promoter sequence was acquired from UCSC genomic browser ( http://genome.ucsc.edu ). ChIP primers were shown in Supplementary Table 5 . ChIP signals were represented in the percentage (%) of signals from total chromatin used, and fold of enrichment calculated by normalizing against signals of nonspecific IgG.  Microarray analysis Total RNA was extracted and the transcript expression quantified using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse arrays as described 18 . RNA hybridization, scanning and signal quantification were performed by RU Gemonic Resources Center. Hybridization signals were retrieved and normalized, followed by differential expression analysis and statistical analysis using GeneSpring Analysis Platform GX 7.0 (Agilent Technologies).  RT-PCR analysis Reverse transcription of RNA was performed using the random hexamer and Invitrogen Superscript III kit. Usually the PCR amplicon (size ?90-200bp) is designed to span over large intron regions. Exon-intron information was obtained from UCSC genomic browser. Quantitative PCR was performed in triplicate using SYBR green master mix reagent (Applied Biosystem) on a Stratagene Mx3005P QPCR system. Primer information is shown in Supplementary Table 5 .  Flow cytometry (FACS) Cells were blocked with BD FcBlock (2.4G2) and stained on ice with fluro-conjugated antibodies (1:1,000 dilution of Cd117FITC, Sca-IPE:CY7, Cd34APC, Cd34FITC, Cd11bAPC, Gr-1PE, Cd19PE or B220PE, BD Biosciences) and analyzed on BD FACSCalibor cytometer. Data was collected and analyzed using CellQuestPro and FlowJo software.  Immunofluorescence microscopy Suspension cultured hematopoietic cells were attached to cover slips treated with 0.01% (w/v) poly-lysine, followed by 15-minute fixation in 4% of parafomaldehyde and 10-min solubilization in PBS, 0.2% Triton-X100 and 0.2% NP-40. After a 30-min block in PBS, 2.5% BSA and 10% normal goat serum, cells were stained with primary antibodies (M2 ?-FLAG [1:1,000?2,000 dilution of 1mg/mL], rabbit ?-H3K4me3 [Upstate 07-473 or Abcam 8580, 1:2,000] or rabbit ?-H3K9me3 antibodies [Upstate 07-442, 1:1,000]) followed by washing and staining with fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies. After washing, fluorescent signal was visualized and analyzed with a DeltaVision Image Restoration Microscope and a Cofocal Microscope (Applied Precision/Olympus). Deconvolution microscopy image analysis was performed to reassign the out-of-focus blurred light to its origin 35 , and subcellular co-localization analysis was carried out from stacks of deconvolved images using ImageJ (Rasband WS, et al. NIH, Bethesda, USA; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ ) and the plugin JACoP 36 . Confocal microscopy analysis was performed as previously described 37 . Co-immunostaining statistics was analyzed using Pearson’s Coefficient of Correlation method. Image acquisition, processing and analyses were performed with the expert help from RU Bio-Imaging Center, and detailed protocols are available upon request.  Statistics All results are presented as the mean and standard deviation (s.d). Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t-test.  Protein preparation for structural studies The gene fragment encoding JARID1APHD3 was fused to the C-terminus of a His(6x)-SUMO tag in a modified pRSFDuet-1 vector (Novagen), with a ubiquitin-like-protease (ULP) cleavage site located at the linker region. The bacterial expressed protein was purified using a Ni-NTA affinity column, followed by ULP cleavage, separation of JARID1APHD3 from His(6x)-SUMO via a second Ni-NTA chromatography step, and gel filtration. The JARIPD1APHD3-H3K4me3 complex was obtained by mixing JARIPD1APHD3 protein with an equal molar amount of H31-9K4me3 peptides (H3 amino acids 1-9, with Lys4 tri-methylated), then purified by gel filtration, and concentrated by ultrafiltration.  Crystal growth The crystals of JARIPD1APHD3-H3K4me3 complexes were obtained by equilibrating a reservoir consisting of 20% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether 2000, 10mM nickel (II) chloride hexahydrate, and 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5) with a hanging drop consisting of 1 ? L of the reservoir solution and 1 ? L of a 27 mg/mL protein solution in 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 5mM DTT and 50 mM NaCl (Crystal Screen 2 kit, Hampton Research). A mixture of the well solution with 10% (v/v) glycerol was used as cryoprotectant.  Data collection and structure determination An anomalous diffraction data set for JARID1APHD3-H31-9K4me3 complex was collected at the zinc anomalous peak wavelength (1.28215 Å) at beamline NE-CAT 24ID-C, Advanced Photon Source, Chicago. The data set was indexed, integrated and merged to 2.2 Å using the program HKL2000. The crystal belongs to I41 space group and contains one molecule per asymmetric unit. Heavy-atom search, SAD phasing and model building were performed with the PHENIX 38 software package. Three zinc atoms were unambiguously identified for SAD phasing, and ?90% residues of the protein-peptide complex were successfully built into the initial model. The PHENIX-model was further manually rebuilt using COOT 39 and refined using REFMAC5 40 in successive cycles. The final refined structure has Rwork and Rfree values of 0.200 and 0.234, respectively ( Supplementary Table 2 ). One molecule forms a domain-swapped dimer with a crystallographic symmetry-related molecule ( Supplementary Fig. 5a ). The swapped segment spans the first 14 residues from the N-terminus. Using a crystal of the complex following pH optimization of crystallization conditions, we were able to collect one 1.9 Å data set at wavelength 0.97949 Å at the same beamline. The crystal belongs to the same crystal form as the previous one. We solved the high-resolution structure by molecular replacement using PHASER 41 with the above 2.2 Å model after removing all the water molecules and some flexible residues. Structure refinement was done using CNSsolve 42 , cycled with manual model building in COOT. Prior to the refinement, the same Rfree set of reflections were transferred from the low-resolution data using the program Freerflag in CCP4 suite 43 for effective cross validation. For both data sets, ?10% reflections were selected in a ‘random’ mode throughout the resolution range. After resetting the overall B-factor to 20 Å2 and rigid body refinement, simulated annealing starting at 5,000 K was performed to reduce model bias before extensive B-factor and positional refinement. The final model contains full length JARID1APHD3 (1609-1659) with one additional serine at the N-terminus from the expression vector, histone H31-8K4me3, three zinc ions and thirty-two water molecules. The JARID1APHD3-H3K4me3 complex in the crystal shows that one molecule forms a domain-swapped dimmer with a crystallographically symmetry-related molecule ( Supplementary Fig. 5a ). Two zinc ions are integral to the folding of the PHD finger, while the third zinc ion locates at the interface between two domain-swapped dimers, thereby mediating crystal packing ( Supplementary Fig. 5c ). The Rwork and Rfree of the final structure are 0.208 and 0.225 respectively ( Supplementary Table 2 ).  Isotopic labeling, NMR data collection and structure determination Samples used for NMR chemical shift assignments, 15N relaxation measurements, and structure determination contained 0.2-0.5 mM uniformly-[15N]- or [13C, 15N]-labeled JARID1APHD3 in the free state and in complex with unlabeled H31-9K4me3 peptide dissolved in NMR buffer (20 mM Na-phosphate, 1 mM ZnCl2, 5 mM DTT, 90% H2O/10% D2O) at pH 7.0. The sample used for measurements of 15N-1H residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) contained 0.2 mM JARID1APHD3 aligned in 12 mg/ml of bacteriophage Pf1 (Alsa, Riga, Latvia), 10 mM MOPS, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.0. All NMR spectra were collected at the New York Structural Biology Center (NYSBC) using 800 MHz Bruker NMR spectrometers equipped with 1H, 15N, 13C triple-resonance cryogenic probes. Unless indicated otherwise, the sample temperature was controlled at 20°C. A suite of 3D heteronuclear NMR experiments, including HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HBHA(CO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY were acquired for sequential backbone and non-aromatic side chain assignments of JARIPD1APHD3 both in the free state and in complex with H31-9K4me3 peptide in solution. 2D NOESY ( ? mix = 100 ms), 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC ( ? mix = 100 ms), 3D aromatic 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC ( ? mix = 100 ms) and 3D aliphatic 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC ( ? mix = 100 ms) data sets were acquired and used for additional assignments (side chain amide and aromatic groups) and distance constraints. To selectively observe the NOEs between JARIPD1APHD3 and H31-9K4me3 peptide, a [13C,15N]-filtered,13C-edited NOESY ( ? mix = 120 ms) spectrum 44 of uniformly [15N,13C]-labeled JARIPD1APHD3 bound to unlabeled H31-9K4me3 peptide was recorded. One-bond N-H RDCs were determined by using the IPAP 15N-HSQC sequence at 25°C 45 . Standard pulse sequences 46 were used for measurements of the 15N relaxation rates ( R 1, R 2) of JARIPD1APHD3 at 25°C. The spectra were processed and analyzed, respectively, with the NMRPipe 47 and Sparky ( http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky ) software. The solution structures of JARIPD1APHD3 both in the free state and in complex with H31-9K4me3 peptide were first calculated using the CYANA program 48 . Interproton distance constraints were derived from 2D NOESY, 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and 3D 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra. Backbone ? and ? angles were derived from TALOS-based analysis of backbone chemical shifts 49 . A number of hydrogen bonds derived from chemical shift analysis and from observed NOEs characteristic for ? -helices and ? -sheets, were added in the final rounds of structure refinement. Of the 100 final structures calculated by CYANA, 20 structures with the lowest target functions were chosen for further refinement using the Xplor-NIH program 50 , in which 1 D NH RDC restraints, physical force field terms and explicit solvent terms 51 were added to the calculation. The final structures were validated by Procheck-NMR 52 , and the statistics for the 20 final structures are listed in Supplementary Table 3 .  Monomeric state of JARID1A<sub>PHD3</sub> in free and H3<sub>1-9</sub>K4me3-bound states in solution The oligomeric states of JARID1APHD3 (mol. wt. 5.8 kD) and JARID1APHD3-H31-9K4me3 complex (mol. wt. 6.8 kD) were first evaluated by comparing their elution volumes on a Superdex G75 16/60 column, with the calibration line derived from a number of molecular standards. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 7a , the elution volumes of both free JARID1APHD3 and JARID1APHD3-H31-9K4me3 complex are comparable with those expected for their monomeric states, but considerably larger that those expected for their dimeric states. This suggests that JARID1APHD3 is monomeric in solution, for both the free and H31-9K4me3 states. Furthermore, the rotational correlation times of JARID1APHD3 in the free and H31-9K4me3-bound states were estimated as 3.5 ns and 4.5 ns, respectively, based on an analysis of 15N R2/R1 relaxation time ratios ( Supplementary Fig. 7b ) using the quadratic diffusion program 53 . These values are consistent with isotropic tumbling values of a monomeric protein of their respective sizes, further supporting that both free and complexed JARID1APHD3 exist as monomers in solution. Thus, although JARID1APHD3-H3K4me3 complex exhibits a domain-swapped dimer in the crystal, gel filtration and NMR relaxation measurements ( Supplementary Figure 7 ) clearly showed such a complex to be monomeric in solution. Hence the domain-swapped dimerization observed in the crystal is likely to be a characteristic feature of the crystalline state, originating perhaps in packing interactions.
