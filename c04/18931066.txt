EFFECT OF NMSO3 TREATMENT IN A MURINE MODEL OF HUMAN METAPNEUMOVIRUS INFECTION SUMMARY BALB/c mice, infected with human metapneumovirus (hMPV), were treated with NMSO3, one dose of 50 mg/kg given at the time of infection. NMSO3 significantly reduced viral replication in the lungs, as well as hMPV-induced body weight loss, pulmonary inflammation and cytokine production, suggesting that antiviral treatment initiated at the beginning of viral infection can modify hMPV-induced disease.
