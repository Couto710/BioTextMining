Analysis of Cross-Sectional Univariate Measurements for Family Dyads Using Linear Mixed Modeling Outcome measurements from members of the same family are likely correlated. Such intrafamilial correlation (IFC) is an important dimension of the family as a unit but is not always accounted for in analyses of family data. This article demonstrates the use of linear mixed modeling to account for IFC in the important special case of univariate measurements for family dyads collected at a single point in time. Example analyses of data from partnered parents having a child with a chronic condition on their child's adaptation to the condition and on the family's general functioning and management of the condition are provided. Analyses of this kind are reasonably straightforward to generate with popular statistical tools. Thus, it is recommended that IFC be reported as standard practice reflecting the fact that a family dyad is more than just the aggregate of two individuals. Moreover, not accounting for IFC can affect the conclusions.  Discussion The example analyses demonstrate the use of linear mixed modeling for analyzing cross-sectional univariate outcomes for family dyads while accounting for IFC. They address common analysis issues including summary statistics, regression, and mediation, providing interesting insights about family management of childhood chronic conditions. Fathers appear to rate mutuality in managing the condition higher than mothers, considering the dyad to work together more effectively than mothers. After controlling for the impact of general family functioning, mothers appear to rate the family as working together more effectively when fathers participate in the study than when they do not. Fathers’ participation in the study may be an indication that parents are more likely to function as a team in managing their child's condition. On the other hand, it is not clear that these statistically significant differences across parent types will prove to be clinically significant, but these results nonetheless suggest interesting questions for future investigation. Also, the combined family management dimensions of difficulty and parental mutuality fully mediate the impact of general family functioning on child adaptation. These two family management dimensions taken together are as useful as general family functioning for explaining child adaptation and also provide important information on the specific nature of the family's response to the child's condition. Interventions for lowering the difficulty of managing these conditions and for increasing parental mutuality in managing them have the potential for improving child adaptation to chronic conditions. Despite the full mediating effect of family management on general family functioning, investigators might still want to collect measures of family functioning to investigate relationships between specific aspects of family functioning (e.g., problem solving, conflict) with child adaptation and family management. These mediation results have not accounted for the other possible dimensions of family management and so may not provide a complete assessment of the effects of family management. Furthermore, the example analyses treat relationships as linear. It is possible that different conclusions might be reached if the possibility of nonlinear relationships were considered in analyses. This would require nonstandard methods (e.g., as formulated by Knafl, Fennie, & O'Malley, 2006 ). More thorough analyses of the childhood chronic condition data are needed. There are other issues of importance to the example data these analyses do not address, including the impact on child adaptation of child characteristics, especially the type of chronic condition, as well as interaction effects for possible moderator variables. Linear mixed modeling can be used to address such issues using approaches similar to those used in the example analyses. Also, the example data are not as general as possible. Some families of this study have only participating mothers but none only participating fathers and all have two parents. However, models can be extended to account for families with only fathers participating and/or for one-parent families. These kinds of models also can be adjusted readily to analyze cross-sectional univariate measurements for any type of dyad. General linear mixed modeling is a complex statistical method that may appear challenging to some family researchers. A wide variety of covariance matrices is possible. Random effects and/or coefficients can be included as well as fixed effects and/or coefficients. However, the kinds of models needed for analyses for cross-sectional, univariate dyadic family data are reasonably straightforward to generate with popular statistical tools. Thus, it is no longer justifiable to conduct analyses for each family member separately. Moreover, not accounting for IFC can affect the investigator's conclusions. Consequently, it is recommended that IFC estimates should be reported as standard practice in analyses of dyadic family data, reflecting the fact that a family dyad is more than just the aggregate of two individuals ( Kashy & Snyder, 1995 ). Also, a generous significance level should be used to conclude that the IFC is negligible (e.g., p = .25, Kenny & Kashy, 1991 ). General family data can be much more complicated than the childhood chronic condition data analyzed in the example examples reported here. For example, measurements also may be taken over time and/or over more than two family members. More than one type of measurement (e.g., multiple family management dimensions in combination) may need to be considered in analyses. Linear mixed models also can be used in these situations (e.g., Knafl et al., 2005 ) but are not as straightforward as in the simpler case of cross-sectional measurements of a single type of measurement for family dyads. Even in this case, certain kinds of analyses are not conducted readily with linear mixed models. For example, the development of scales measuring parents’ perception of certain aspects of the family would be based on a cross-sectional survey of both mothers and fathers. Standard exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis models assume independence across participants, and so such factor analyses should be conducted using data for only one parent within families. This limitation can be circumvented by first developing family scales using responses for one type of family member (e.g., mothers) and then demonstrating that those scales are compatible with responses from other types of family members (e.g., fathers and/or children). However, it would be preferable to develop family scales using the combined responses for all available family members, but that would require development of factor analysis methods that account for IFC, an issue for future research.
