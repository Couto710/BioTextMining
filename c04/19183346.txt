Pearson’s test, trend test, and MAX are all trend tests with different types of scores Summary Pearson’s test is one of the most commonly used statistics for testing genetic association of case-control data. The trend test is another one which assumes a dose-response model between the risk of the disease and genotypes. To apply the trend test, a set of ordered scores is assigned a priori based on the underlying genetic model. Pearson’s test is model-free and robust, but is less powerful for common genetic models. MAX is another robust test statistic, which takes the maximum of the trend tests over a family of scientifically plausible genetic models. We show that the three test statistics are all trend tests but with different types of scores; whether the scores are prespecified or data-driven, or whether the scores are ordered (restricted) or not ordered (unrestricted). We then provide insights into power performance of the three tests when the underlying genetic model is unknown and discuss which test to use for the analyses of case-control genetic association studies.  INTRODUCTION A case-control study is a useful design to test for association between a genetic marker and a disease. Case-control samples for a single marker can be summarized in a 2 by 3 contingency table, with the rows corresponding to the case and control groups and the columns to three genotypes. Basic test statistics for genetic association using case-control samples are reviewed in Balding (2006) . Pearson’s Chi-square test (Pearson’s test for short) is one of the most commonly used statistics to test for genetic association. The Cochran-Armitage trend test (trend test for short) has also been proposed to test for genetic association ( Sasieni 1997 ), which assumes a dose-response effect between the risk of having the disease and genotypes, i.e. the risk of having the disease increases with the number of risk alleles in the genotype. Three trend tests are often used corresponding to the recessive, additive (multiplicative) and dominant models ( Sasieni 1997 ; Freidlin et al. 2002 ; Lettre et al . 2007 ). For common and complex diseases, the underlying genetic model is usually unknown and is not even necessarily restricted to the above four common genetic models. Choosing a single trend test is not robust when the genetic model is unknown. Therefore, the maximum of the three trend tests across the recessive, additive (multiplicative) and dominant models is proposed ( Freidlin et al. 2002 ), denoted by MAX3. Gonzalez et al. (2008) proposed a method similar to MAX3. MAX3 is included in SAS JMP Genomics Software ( SAS 2008 ) and has been frequently applied to genome-wide association studies ( Sladek et al. 2007 ; Li et al . 2008a ; 2008b ). We consider here a generalization of MAX3 based on ( Davies 1977 , 1987 ). We take the maximum of the trend tests over all possible genetic models rather than only the three genetic models. We denote this maximum-type test by MAX. From Zheng & Chen (2005) , it is expected that MAX and MAX3 would have similar power performance. We only focus on Pearson’s test, the trend test and MAX, because our goal is to find insightful relationship among them. Other tests, including the allelic test and restricted likelihood ratio test ( Wang & Sheffield 2005 ), are also used in practice. But their power performance is similar to that of the three test statistics we consider here ( Sasieni 1997 ; Wang & Sheffield 2005 ; Guedj et al. 2008 ; Knapp 2008 ). Empirical studies have shown that Pearson’s test is more robust than the trend test, and that the maximum-type tests are more powerful than Pearson’s test ( Freidlin et al. 2002 ; Zheng et al. 2006 ; Gonzalez et al. 2008 ). Why and when one test is better than the other is not specifically studied. We will show that the link among the three test statistics is that they are all trend tests with different types of scores, either prespecified or data-driven; either restricted or unrestricted. Our results can then be used to explain the power performance of the three tests and provide insight into the choices of appropriate testing method for case-control genetic association studies.  METHODS Notation and Model Denote the genotype counts for cases by ( r 0, r 1, r 2) and for controls by ( s 0, s 1, s 2). Let r = r 0 + r 1 + r 2 and s = s 0 + s 1 + s 2 be the numbers of cases and controls, and n i = r i + s i for i = 0, 1, 2. Let n = r + s . Penetrances are denoted by f i = pr(disease| G i ), i = 0, 1, 2, where ( G 0, G 1, G 2) = ( AA, AB, BB ) are three genotypes. Genotype relative risks (GRRs) are given by ?1 = f 1/ f 0 and ?2 = f 2/ f 0. The null hypothesis H 0 is expressed as H 0: ?1 = ?2 = 1. If allele B is the risk allele under the alternative hypothesis H 1, we expect under the dose-response model that ?2 ? ?1 ? 1 and ?2 > 1. The recessive, additive, multiplicative and dominant models correspond to ?1 = 1, ?1 = (1 + ?2)/2, ?1 = ? 2 1 / 2 , and ?1 = ?2 respectively. To illustrate the three models, we consider a reparameterization with ?1 = 1 + ? cos ? and ?2 = 1 + ? sin ?, where ? ? [0, 2?] and ? ? 0 ( Figure 1 ). Under the alternative hypothesis H 1, (?1, ?2) and (?, ?) are one-to-one correspondent. Under H 0, (?1, ?2) = (1,1) is equivalent to H 0 : ? = 0, under which the parameter ? vanishes and is not defined. Under H 1, the parameter ? corresponds to a genetic model. For examples, the recessive, additive and dominant models correspond to ? = ?/2, arctan(2), and ?/4, respectively. How ? = arctan(2) = tan?1(2) is obtained under the additive model is as follows. Under the additive model, we have 2?1 = 1 + ?2, which is equivalent to 2?cos? = ?sin?. Since ? ? 0 under H 1, it is equivalent to tan ? = sin ? / cos ? = 2, i.e. ? = arctan ?. Using ? can make it easier to plot the powers across all possible genetic models. However, we will use both parameterizations, one using GRRs (?1, ?2) and the other using the new coordinates (?, ?), for the comparison of powers When (?1, ?2) ? (1,1), the additive model approximates the multiplicative model. If we restrict our attention to a family of genetic models ranging from the recessive to the dominant models (including the additive and multiplicative models), then ? is contained in [?/4, ?/2] when B is the risk allele or in [5?/4, 3?/2] when A is the risk allele, where the interval [5?/4, 3?/2] is obtained by adding ? to [?/4,?/2]. Adding ?, cos(?+?) = ?cos ? and sin(?+?) = ?sin ?. Thus, by adding ?, the genetic model does not change, but the order of 1 ? ?1 ? ?2 is reversed to ?1 ? ?2 ? 1. If we do not put restrictions on the underlying genetic model, then ? ? [0, 2?]. Cochran-Armitage Trend Test and Scores To obtain the Cochran-Armitage trend test (CATT), a set of increasing scores is specified, denoted by ( x 0, x 1, x 2) such that x 0 ? x 1 ? x 2 and x 0 < x 2. Later we show that the scores can be decreasing too ( x 0 ? x 1 ? x 2 and x 0 > x 2). Then the trend test can be written as ( Sasieni 1997 ; Freidlin et al. 2002 ) (1) T CATT ( x 0 , x 1 , x 2 ) = { ? j = 0 2 x j ( ( 1 ? ? ) r j ? ? s j ) } 2 [ n ? ( 1 ? ? ) { ? j = 0 2 x j 2 n j / n ? ( ? j = 0 2 x j n j / n ) 2 } ] , where ? = r/n . The trend test T CATT( x 0, x 1, x 2) is invariant to a linear transformation of the scores. That is, T CATT( x 0, x 1, x 2) ? T CATT (0, x , 1) where x = ( x 1 ? x 0)/( x 2 ? x 0). Under H 0, T CATT(0, x , 1) asymptotically follows a Chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom (DF) for a fixed x . For the recessive, additive (or multiplicative) and dominant models, x = 0, 1/2 and 1, respectively. These choices of scores correspond to ? = ?/2, arctan(2), and ?/4, respectively. Note that the scores ( x 0, x 1, x 2) increase when x = ( x 1 ? x 0)/( x 2 ? x 0) ? [0, 1]. The scores ( x 0, x 1, x 2) can be decreasing, under which linear transformations can change the decreasing scores to increasing scores. For example, a linear transformation of the decreasing scores ( x 0, x 1, x 2) is given by (1, ( x 1 ? x 2)/( x 0 ? x 2), 0) followed by another linear transformation to (0, 1 ? ( x 1 ? x 2)/( x 0 ? x 2), 1) = (0, ( x 0 ? x 1)/( x 0 ? x 2), 1) = (0, x , 1), which are increasing scores. Therefore we only require the scores in the trend test in (1) be ordered or x ? [0, 1]. When the possible genetic model ranges from the recessive model to the dominant model, we have x ? [0, 1] with increasing scores, which corresponds to ? ? [?/4,?/2]. (? ? [5?/4, 3?/2] corresponds to the decreasing scores.) For the underlying genetic models outside of this range, x ? [0, 1], e.g. the overdominant model ( x > 1) or underdominant model ( x < 0). In practice, when the GRRs (?1, ?2) are ordered, ?2 ? ?1 ? 1 and ?2 > 1 or ?2 ? ?1 ? 1 and ?2 < 1, the trend test is a powerful statistic if it incorporates the correct orders in the scores. However, the trend test may not be robust when the orders are misspecified. Pearson’s Test Pearson’s test, denoted by T ? 2 2 , is given by (2) T ? 2 2 = ? i = 0 2 ( r i ? n i r / n ) 2 n i r / n + ? i = 0 2 ( s i ? n i s / n ) 2 n i s / n . Under H 0, T ? 2 2 asymptotically follows a Chi-square distribution with 2 DF. From (2) , unlike the trend test T CATT(0, x , 1), T ? 2 2 does not depend on the scores or the underlying genetic model. Thus, it is more robust than T CATT(0, x , 1), in particular when the score x is misspecified. Analyses of ordered categorical data using Pearson’s test and its decomposition studied in Haberman (1974) and Goodman (1979) indicated that Pearson’s test is related to the trend tests for ordered categorical data. One such relationship is obtained here in the following result (its proof is given in the Appendix ). RESULT 1 Define scores ( x 0 * , x 1 * , x 2 * ) = ( r 0/n0, r 1/ n 1, r 2/ n 2). Let x * = ( x 1 * ? x 0 * ) / ( x 2 * ? x 0 * ) . Then (3) T ? 2 2 ? T CATT ( 0 , x * , 1 ) . This result shows that Pearson’s test is also the trend test with the scores (0, x *, 1). For the retrospective case-control design, the score x * is not determined a priori. It is data-driven. One insight of these scores can be seen from a prospective case-control study, in which the scores ( x 0 * , x 1 * , x 2 * ) are the maximum likelihood estimates of the penetrances ( f 0, f 1, f 2). For the retrospective case-control study, however, ( x 0 * , x 1 * , x 2 * ) are the proportions of cases with the given genotypes, which are biased as estimates for the penetrances. As a contrast, the trend test, T CATT(0, x , 1) with x ? [0, 1], uses increasing scores. Thus, even when the true GRRs are not ordered, the scores for the trend test are still ordered, while the scores (0, x *, 1) for Pearson’s test are not necessarily ordered. The data-driven scores (0, x *, 1) may capture more information about whether or not the true GRRs are ordered than just using arbitrary ordered scores. Result (3) provides insight into the performance between Pearson’s test and the trend test. The robustness of Pearson’s test comes from its use of the data-driven scores which is not necessarily ordered. On the other hand, the trend test is more powerful when the scores are correctly specified in terms of the orders. In addition, because the scores for Pearson’s test are random, Pearson’s test needs higher DF than the trend test that uses fixed scores. Therefore, when the true GRRs are ordered, the trend test with smaller DF is more powerful than Pearson’s test with higher DF. MAX The MAX statistic discussed in Freidlin et al. (2002) can be written as MAX 3 = max ( T CATT 1 / 2 ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) , T CATT 1 / 2 ( 0 , 1 / 2 , 1 ) , T CATT 1 / 2 ( 0 , 1 , 1 ) ) . Under H 0, the distribution of MAX3 can be obtained by simulation ( Freidlin et al. 2002 ) or multiple integrations ( Conneely & Boehnke 2007 ; Gonzalez et al. 2008 ; Li et al. 2008). We consider the modified MAX-type test studied by Davies (1977 , 1987) , given by (4) MAX = max x ? [ 0 , 1 ] T CATT ( 0 , x , 1 ) . The MAX statistic given in (4) not only covers all three genetic models considered in MAX3 but also includes all other models between the recessive model ( x = 0) and the dominant model ( x = 1). Following the isotonic regression and pool adjacent violator algorithm ( Robertson et al. 1988 ; Kimeldorf et al. 1992 ; Zheng, 2003 ), we show in Appendix that MAX is attained at T CATT(0, x *, 1) if the x * given in Result 1 lies in interval [0, 1] and, otherwise, MAX is reached at max ( T CATT(0, 0, 1), T CATT(0, 1, 1)). This can be summarized as follows MAX = T CATT ( 0 , x * , 1 ) if x * ? [ 0 , 1 ] ; = max ( T CATT ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) , T CATT ( 0 , 1 , 1 ) ) if x * ? [ 0 , 1 ] . From the above argument, we obtain RESULT 2 When the data-driven score x * ? [0, 1], we have MAX ? T ? 2 2 . This result shows that, when the score x * is restricted to 0 and 1 due to the orders corresponding to the underlying genetic model from the recessive model to the dominant model, MAX is identical to Pearson’s test. In other words, MAX captures all the information in Pearson’s test. In addition, when the true GRRs are ordered from the recessive model to the dominant models, MAX is more powerful than Pearson’s test due to its restriction. On the other hand, when the true GRRs are not ordered (i.e. a large family of genetic models is considered), Pearson’s test may be more powerful than MAX. Hence, Pearson’s test should be more robust than MAX when the family of genetic models include the overdominant (underdominant) model. The above results are summarized in Table 1 . The comparison in Table 1 also includes MAX3.  METHODS Notation and Model Denote the genotype counts for cases by ( r 0, r 1, r 2) and for controls by ( s 0, s 1, s 2). Let r = r 0 + r 1 + r 2 and s = s 0 + s 1 + s 2 be the numbers of cases and controls, and n i = r i + s i for i = 0, 1, 2. Let n = r + s . Penetrances are denoted by f i = pr(disease| G i ), i = 0, 1, 2, where ( G 0, G 1, G 2) = ( AA, AB, BB ) are three genotypes.

If allele B is the risk allele under the alternative hypothesis H 1, we expect under the dose-response model that ?2 ? ?1 ? 1 and ?2 > 1. The recessive, additive, multiplicative and dominant models correspond to ?1 = 1, ?1 = (1 + ?2)/2, ?1 = ? 2 1 / 2 , and ?1 = ?2 respectively. To illustrate the three models, we consider a reparameterization with ?1 = 1 + ? cos ? and ?2 = 1 + ? sin ?, where ? ? [0, 2?] and ? ? 0 ( Figure 1 ). Under the alternative hypothesis H 1, (?1, ?2) and (?, ?) are one-to-one correspondent. Under H 0, (?1, ?2) = (1,1) is equivalent to H 0 : ? = 0, under which the parameter ? vanishes and is not defined. Under H 1, the parameter ? corresponds to a genetic model. For examples, the recessive, additive and dominant models correspond to ? = ?/2, arctan(2), and ?/4, respectively. How ? = arctan(2) = tan?1(2) is obtained under the additive model is as follows. Under the additive model, we have 2?1 = 1 + ?2, which is equivalent to 2?cos? = ?sin?. Since ? ? 0 under H 1, it is equivalent to tan ? = sin ? / cos ? = 2, i.e. ? = arctan ?. Using ? can make it easier to plot the powers across all possible genetic models. However, we will use both parameterizations, one using GRRs (?1, ?2) and the other using the new coordinates (?, ?), for the comparison of powers When (?1, ?2) ?

Adding ?, cos(?+?) = ?cos ? and sin(?+?) = ?sin ?. Thus, by adding ?, the genetic model does not change, but the order of 1 ? ?1 ? ?2 is reversed to ?1 ? ?2 ? 1. If we do not put restrictions on the underlying genetic model, then ? ? [0, 2?].

Then the trend test can be written as ( Sasieni 1997 ; Freidlin et al. 2002 ) (1) T CATT ( x 0 , x 1 , x 2 ) = { ? j = 0 2 x j ( ( 1 ? ? ) r j ? ? s j ) } 2 [ n ? ( 1 ? ? ) { ? j = 0 2 x j 2 n j / n ? ( ? j = 0 2 x j n j / n ) 2 } ] , where ? = r/n . The trend test T CATT( x 0, x 1, x 2) is invariant to a linear transformation of the scores. That is, T CATT( x 0, x 1, x 2) ? T CATT (0, x , 1) where x = ( x 1 ? x 0)/( x 2 ? x 0). Under H 0, T CATT(0, x , 1) asymptotically follows a Chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom (DF) for a fixed x . For the recessive, additive (or multiplicative) and dominant models, x = 0, 1/2 and 1, respectively. These choices of scores correspond to ? = ?/2, arctan(2), and ?/4, respectively. Note that the scores ( x 0, x 1, x 2) increase when x = ( x 1 ? x 0)/( x 2 ? x 0) ? [0, 1]. The scores ( x 0, x 1, x 2) can be decreasing, under which linear transformations can change the decreasing scores to increasing scores. For example, a linear transformation of the decreasing scores ( x 0, x 1, x 2) is given by (1, ( x 1 ? x 2)/( x 0 ? x 2), 0) followed by another linear transformation to (0, 1 ? ( x 1 ? x 2)/( x 0 ? x 2), 1) = (0, ( x 0 ? x 1)/( x 0 ? x 2), 1) = (0, x , 1), which are increasing scores. Therefore we only require the scores in the trend test in (1) be ordered or x ? [0, 1]. When the possible genetic model ranges from the recessive model to the dominant model, we have x ? [0, 1] with increasing scores, which corresponds to ? ? [?/4,?/2]. (? ? [5?/4, 3?/2] corresponds to the decreasing scores.) For the underlying genetic models outside of this range, x ? [0, 1], e.g. the overdominant model ( x > 1) or underdominant model ( x < 0). In practice, when the GRRs (?1, ?2) are ordered, ?2 ? ?1 ? 1 and ?2 > 1 or ?2 ? ?1 ? 1 and ?2 < 1, the trend test is a powerful statistic if it incorporates the correct orders in the scores. However, the trend test may not be robust when the orders are misspecified.

Under H 0, T ? 2 2 asymptotically follows a Chi-square distribution with 2 DF. From (2) , unlike the trend test T CATT(0, x , 1), T ? 2 2 does not depend on the scores or the underlying genetic model. Thus, it is more robust than T CATT(0, x , 1), in particular when the score x is misspecified.

Genotype relative risks (GRRs) are given by ?1 = f 1/ f 0 and ?2 = f 2/ f 0. The null hypothesis H 0 is expressed as H 0: ?1 = ?2 = 1. If allele B is the risk allele under the alternative hypothesis H 1, we expect under the dose-response model that ?2 ? ?1 ? 1 and ?2 > 1. The recessive, additive, multiplicative and dominant models correspond to ?1 = 1, ?1 = (1 + ?2)/2, ?1 = ? 2 1 / 2 , and ?1 = ?2 respectively. To illustrate the three models, we consider a reparameterization with ?1 = 1 + ? cos ? and ?2 = 1 + ? sin ?, where ? ? [0, 2?] and ? ? 0 ( Figure 1 ). Under the alternative hypothesis H 1, (?1, ?2) and (?, ?) are one-to-one correspondent. Under H 0, (?1, ?2) = (1,1) is equivalent to H 0 : ? = 0, under which the parameter ? vanishes and is not defined. Under H 1, the parameter ? corresponds to a genetic model. For examples, the recessive, additive and dominant models correspond to ? = ?/2, arctan(2), and ?/4, respectively. How ? = arctan(2) = tan?1(2) is obtained under the additive model is as follows. Under the additive model, we have 2?1 = 1 + ?2, which is equivalent to 2?cos? = ?sin?. Since ? ? 0 under H 1, it is equivalent to tan ? = sin ? / cos ? = 2, i.e. ? = arctan ?. Using ? can make it easier to plot the powers across all possible genetic models. However, we will use both parameterizations, one using GRRs (?1, ?2) and the other using the new coordinates (?, ?), for the comparison of powers When (?1, ?2) ? (1,1), the additive model approximates the multiplicative model. If we restrict our attention to a family of genetic models ranging from the recessive to the dominant models (including the additive and multiplicative models), then ? is contained in [?/4, ?/2] when B is the risk allele or in [5?/4, 3?/2] when A is the risk allele, where the interval [5?/4, 3?/2] is obtained by adding ? to [?/4,?/2]. Adding ?, cos(?+?) = ?cos ? and sin(?+?) = ?sin ?. Thus, by adding ?, the genetic model does not change, but the order of 1 ? ?1 ? ?2 is reversed to ?1 ? ?2 ? 1. If we do not put restrictions on the underlying genetic model, then ? ? [0, 2?].  Cochran-Armitage Trend Test and Scores To obtain the Cochran-Armitage trend test (CATT), a set of increasing scores is specified, denoted by ( x 0, x 1, x 2) such that x 0 ? x 1 ? x 2 and x 0 < x 2. Later we show that the scores can be decreasing too ( x 0 ? x 1 ? x 2 and x 0 > x 2). Then the trend test can be written as ( Sasieni 1997 ; Freidlin et al. 2002 ) (1) T CATT ( x 0 , x 1 , x 2 ) = { ? j = 0 2 x j ( ( 1 ? ? ) r j ? ? s j ) } 2 [ n ? ( 1 ? ? ) { ? j = 0 2 x j 2 n j / n ? ( ? j = 0 2 x j n j / n ) 2 } ] , where ? = r/n . The trend test T CATT( x 0, x 1, x 2) is invariant to a linear transformation of the scores. That is, T CATT( x 0, x 1, x 2) ? T CATT (0, x , 1) where x = ( x 1 ? x 0)/( x 2 ? x 0). Under H 0, T CATT(0, x , 1) asymptotically follows a Chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom (DF) for a fixed x . For the recessive, additive (or multiplicative) and dominant models, x = 0, 1/2 and 1, respectively. These choices of scores correspond to ? = ?/2, arctan(2), and ?/4, respectively. Note that the scores ( x 0, x 1, x 2) increase when x = ( x 1 ? x 0)/( x 2 ? x 0) ? [0, 1]. The scores ( x 0, x 1, x 2) can be decreasing, under which linear transformations can change the decreasing scores to increasing scores. For example, a linear transformation of the decreasing scores ( x 0, x 1, x 2) is given by (1, ( x 1 ? x 2)/( x 0 ? x 2), 0) followed by another linear transformation to (0, 1 ? ( x 1 ? x 2)/( x 0 ? x 2), 1) = (0, ( x 0 ? x 1)/( x 0 ? x 2), 1) = (0, x , 1), which are increasing scores. Therefore we only require the scores in the trend test in (1) be ordered or x ? [0, 1]. When the possible genetic model ranges from the recessive model to the dominant model, we have x ? [0, 1] with increasing scores, which corresponds to ? ? [?/4,?/2]. (? ? [5?/4, 3?/2] corresponds to the decreasing scores.) For the underlying genetic models outside of this range, x ? [0, 1], e.g. the overdominant model ( x > 1) or underdominant model ( x < 0). In practice, when the GRRs (?1, ?2) are ordered, ?2 ? ?1 ? 1 and ?2 > 1 or ?2 ? ?1 ? 1 and ?2 < 1, the trend test is a powerful statistic if it incorporates the correct orders in the scores. However, the trend test may not be robust when the orders are misspecified.  Cochran-Armitage Trend Test and Scores To obtain the Cochran-Armitage trend test (CATT), a set of increasing scores is specified, denoted by ( x 0, x 1, x 2) such that x 0 ? x 1 ? x 2 and x 0 < x 2. Later we show that the scores can be decreasing too ( x 0 ? x 1 ? x 2 and x 0 > x 2). Then the trend test can be written as ( Sasieni 1997 ; Freidlin et al. 2002 ) (1) T CATT ( x 0 , x 1 , x 2 ) = { ? j = 0 2 x j ( ( 1 ? ? ) r j ? ? s j ) } 2 [ n ? ( 1 ? ? ) { ? j = 0 2 x j 2 n j / n ? ( ? j = 0 2 x j n j / n ) 2 } ] , where ? = r/n . The trend test T CATT( x 0, x 1, x 2) is invariant to a linear transformation of the scores. That is, T CATT( x 0, x 1, x 2) ? T CATT (0, x , 1) where x = ( x 1 ? x 0)/( x 2 ? x 0). Under H 0, T CATT(0, x , 1) asymptotically follows a Chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom (DF) for a fixed x . For the recessive, additive (or multiplicative) and dominant models, x = 0, 1/2 and 1, respectively. These choices of scores correspond to ? = ?/2, arctan(2), and ?/4, respectively. Note that the scores ( x 0, x 1, x 2) increase when x = ( x 1 ? x 0)/( x 2 ? x 0) ? [0, 1]. The scores ( x 0, x 1, x 2) can be decreasing, under which linear transformations can change the decreasing scores to increasing scores. For example, a linear transformation of the decreasing scores ( x 0, x 1, x 2) is given by (1, ( x 1 ? x 2)/( x 0 ? x 2), 0) followed by another linear transformation to (0, 1 ? ( x 1 ? x 2)/( x 0 ? x 2), 1) = (0, ( x 0 ? x 1)/( x 0 ? x 2), 1) = (0, x , 1), which are increasing scores. Therefore we only require the scores in the trend test in (1) be ordered or x ? [0, 1]. When the possible genetic model ranges from the recessive model to the dominant model, we have x ? [0, 1] with increasing scores, which corresponds to ? ? [?/4,?/2]. (? ? [5?/4, 3?/2] corresponds to the decreasing scores.) For the underlying genetic models outside of this range, x ? [0, 1], e.g. the overdominant model ( x > 1) or underdominant model ( x < 0). In practice, when the GRRs (?1, ?2) are ordered, ?2 ? ?1 ? 1 and ?2 > 1 or ?2 ? ?1 ? 1 and ?2 < 1, the trend test is a powerful statistic if it incorporates the correct orders in the scores. However, the trend test may not be robust when the orders are misspecified.  Pearson’s Test Pearson’s test, denoted by T ? 2 2 , is given by (2) T ? 2 2 = ? i = 0 2 ( r i ? n i r / n ) 2 n i r / n + ? i = 0 2 ( s i ? n i s / n ) 2 n i s / n . Under H 0, T ? 2 2 asymptotically follows a Chi-square distribution with 2 DF. From (2) , unlike the trend test T CATT(0, x , 1), T ? 2 2 does not depend on the scores or the underlying genetic model. Thus, it is more robust than T CATT(0, x , 1), in particular when the score x is misspecified. Analyses of ordered categorical data using Pearson’s test and its decomposition studied in Haberman (1974) and Goodman (1979) indicated that Pearson’s test is related to the trend tests for ordered categorical data. One such relationship is obtained here in the following result (its proof is given in the Appendix ). RESULT 1 Define scores ( x 0 * , x 1 * , x 2 * ) = ( r 0/n0, r 1/ n 1, r 2/ n 2). Let x * = ( x 1 * ? x 0 * ) / ( x 2 * ? x 0 * ) . Then (3) T ? 2 2 ? T CATT ( 0 , x * , 1 ) . This result shows that Pearson’s test is also the trend test with the scores (0, x *, 1). For the retrospective case-control design, the score x * is not determined a priori. It is data-driven. One insight of these scores can be seen from a prospective case-control study, in which the scores ( x 0 * , x 1 * , x 2 * ) are the maximum likelihood estimates of the penetrances ( f 0, f 1, f 2). For the retrospective case-control study, however, ( x 0 * , x 1 * , x 2 * ) are the proportions of cases with the given genotypes, which are biased as estimates for the penetrances. As a contrast, the trend test, T CATT(0, x , 1) with x ? [0, 1], uses increasing scores. Thus, even when the true GRRs are not ordered, the scores for the trend test are still ordered, while the scores (0, x *, 1) for Pearson’s test are not necessarily ordered. The data-driven scores (0, x *, 1) may capture more information about whether or not the true GRRs are ordered than just using arbitrary ordered scores. Result (3) provides insight into the performance between Pearson’s test and the trend test. The robustness of Pearson’s test comes from its use of the data-driven scores which is not necessarily ordered. On the other hand, the trend test is more powerful when the scores are correctly specified in terms of the orders. In addition, because the scores for Pearson’s test are random, Pearson’s test needs higher DF than the trend test that uses fixed scores. Therefore, when the true GRRs are ordered, the trend test with smaller DF is more powerful than Pearson’s test with higher DF.  Pearson’s Test Pearson’s test, denoted by T ? 2 2 , is given by (2) T ? 2 2 = ? i = 0 2 ( r i ? n i r / n ) 2 n i r / n + ? i = 0 2 ( s i ? n i s / n ) 2 n i s / n . Under H 0, T ? 2 2 asymptotically follows a Chi-square distribution with 2 DF. From (2) , unlike the trend test T CATT(0, x , 1), T ? 2 2 does not depend on the scores or the underlying genetic model.

(2002) can be written as MAX 3 = max ( T CATT 1 / 2 ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) , T CATT 1 / 2 ( 0 , 1 / 2 , 1 ) , T CATT 1 / 2 ( 0 , 1 , 1 ) ) . Under H 0, the distribution of MAX3 can be obtained by simulation ( Freidlin et al. 2002 ) or multiple integrations ( Conneely & Boehnke 2007 ; Gonzalez et al. 2008 ; Li et al. 2008). We consider the modified MAX-type test studied by Davies (1977 , 1987) , given by (4) MAX = max x ? [ 0 , 1 ] T CATT ( 0 , x , 1 ) . The MAX statistic given in (4) not only covers all three genetic models considered in MAX3 but also includes all other models between the recessive model ( x = 0) and the dominant model ( x = 1). Following the isotonic regression and pool adjacent violator algorithm ( Robertson et al. 1988 ; Kimeldorf et al. 1992 ; Zheng, 2003 ), we show in Appendix that MAX is attained at T CATT(0, x *, 1) if the x * given in Result 1 lies in interval [0, 1] and, otherwise, MAX is reached at max ( T CATT(0, 0, 1), T CATT(0, 1, 1)). This can be summarized as follows MAX = T CATT ( 0 , x * , 1 ) if x * ? [ 0 , 1 ] ; = max ( T CATT ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) , T CATT ( 0 , 1 , 1 ) ) if x * ? [ 0 , 1 ] . From the above argument, we obtain RESULT 2 When the data-driven score x * ? [0, 1], we have MAX ? T ? 2 2 . This result shows that, when the score x * is restricted to 0 and 1 due to the orders corresponding to the underlying genetic model from the recessive model to the dominant model, MAX is identical to Pearson’s test. In other words, MAX captures all the information in Pearson’s test. In addition, when the true GRRs are ordered from the recessive model to the dominant models, MAX is more powerful than Pearson’s test due to its restriction. On the other hand, when the true GRRs are not ordered (i.e. a large family of genetic models is considered), Pearson’s test may be more powerful than MAX. Hence, Pearson’s test should be more robust than MAX when the family of genetic models include the overdominant (underdominant) model. The above results are summarized in Table 1 . The comparison in Table 1 also includes MAX3.  MAX The MAX statistic discussed in Freidlin et al. (2002) can be written as MAX 3 = max ( T CATT 1 / 2 ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) , T CATT 1 / 2 ( 0 , 1 / 2 , 1 ) , T CATT 1 / 2 ( 0 , 1 , 1 ) ) .

This can be summarized as follows MAX = T CATT ( 0 , x * , 1 ) if x * ? [ 0 , 1 ] ; = max ( T CATT ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) , T CATT ( 0 , 1 , 1 ) ) if x * ? [ 0 , 1 ] . From the above argument, we obtain RESULT 2 When the data-driven score x * ? [0, 1], we have MAX ? T ? 2 2 . This result shows that, when the score x * is restricted to 0 and 1 due to the orders corresponding to the underlying genetic model from the recessive model to the dominant model, MAX is identical to Pearson’s test.

The comparison in Table 1 also includes MAX3.  NUMERICAL RESULTS Table 2 reports the results from a simulation study to examine how often the data-driven scores ( x 0 * , x 1 * , x 2 * ) are ordered when the true GRRs are ordered. We chose ?0 = ?/(2?) ? [0, 1] with increments of 0.001 for a genetic model and ? = 1.0 for the alternative hypothesis. The sample sizes were r = s = 150 with a minor allele frequency of 0.3. The frequency that the scores ( x 0 * , x 1 * , x 2 * ) are ordered, denoted by freq , was estimated using 1,000 replicates. Results in Table 2 show that the frequencies with the ordered scores ( x 0 * , x 1 * , x 2 * ) are usually higher when the true GRRs are ordered (order = yes). Figure 2 shows the box plots of the frequencies of ordered data-driven scores when the true GRRs are ordered or not. We noticed that when the true GRRs are ordered, the frequency of ordered data-driven scores ranges from 48.2% (in Table 2 ) to 99.7% with a mean and median frequencies of 79.2% and 77.0%, and a standard deviation of 15.4% (data not shown). Table 3 reports some of the simulated powers of the three test statistics given ?0 ? [0, 1] or ? ? [0, 2?]. The genotype counts ( r 0, r 1, r 2) in cases and ( s 0, s 1, s 2) in controls were simulated from the multinomial distributions Mul ( r;p 0, p 1, p 2) and Mul ( s; q 0, q 1, q 2), respectively, where p i = pr( G i ) f i / k and q i = pr( G i )(1 ? f i )/(1 ? k ) for i = 0, 1, 2, and k is the disease prevalence. Genotype frequencies q i = pr( G i ) were calculated under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for a given minor allele frequency. Under H 0, f 0 = f 1 = f 2 = k and p i = q i = pr( G i ) for all i = 0, 1, 2. Under H 1, (?1, ?2) were obtained given (?, ?). Then, f 0 = k /{pr( G 0) + ?1pr( G 1) + ?2pr( G 2)}, f 1 = ?1 f 0 and f 2 = ?2 f 0 were calculated. Finally, the probabilities p i and q i were calculated. In all simulations, k and the minor allele frequency were fixed. We chose k = 0.1 and minor allele frequencies p = 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5. We first simulated data under H 0 so that the critical values for the three test statistics were determined. The sample sizes are r = s = 150. The critical values for the three statistics (Pearson’s test, the trend test and MAX) were determined using 100,000 replicates. Then we simulated data under H 1 and estimated the power using 10,000 replicates and the previously simulated critical values. The sample sizes for the power comparison were also r = s = 150. All test statistics have good control of Type I errors using this Monte-Carlo simulation approach (results not shown). In Table 3 , ? = 1. The largest power among the three tests is highlighted (in some cases, the second largest power is also highlighted when the difference of power is less than 0.1%). We see that, in the top panel in Table 3 (for the ordered GRRs), either the CATT or MAX is most powerful, and Pearson’s test is usually less powerful, in particular that MAX is always more powerful than Pearson’s test when ?0 ? [0.125,0.250] corresponding to the ordered GRRs with ? ? [?/4,?/2]. (Note that when ?0 ? [0.625,0.750] or ? ? [5?/4, 3?/2], the genetic model is also ordered.) The CATT is often most powerful for ?0 in the middle around the additive model (?0 = 0.176 with (?1, ?2) = (1.448,1.894)), while MAX is often most powerful for the models around the recessive model (?0 = 0.250 with (?1, ?2) = (1, 2)) and the dominant model (?0 = 0.125 with (?1, ?2) = (1.707,1.707)). On the other hand, when the GRRs are not ordered (the bottom panel), i.e. ?0 ? [0.125, 0.250], we only present some results for ?0 ? [0.275, 0.400]. When the GRRs are not ordered, Pearson’s test is always most powerful under the models of consideration, while the CATT loses substantial power when the ordered scores are still used. For minor allele frequency p = 0.3 and ? = 0.8, the maximum power of the three test statistics was chosen over all values of ?0 ? [0,1] and plotted in Figure 3 , where D (?0 = 0.125 with (?1, ?2) = (1.566,1.566) and 0.625 with (?1,?2) = (0.434,0.434)), A (?0 = 0.176 with (?1, ?2) = (1.359,1.715) and 0.676 with (?1, ?2) = (0.641, 0.285)) and R (?0= 0.25 with (?1, ?2) = (0,1.8) and 0.75 with (?1, ?2) = (0,0.2)) stand for the dominant, additive and recessive models, respectively. Figure 3 shows that within the range from the recessive model to the dominant model (?0 ? [0.125, 0.250]) or in the range from the dominant model to the recessive model (?0 ? [0.625, 0.750]), either the CATT or MAX is most powerful. The CATT is most powerful when the genetic model is close to the additive to the dominant models while MAX is most powerful when the genetic model is close to the recessive. Pearson’s test is often most powerful outside of the two ordered ranges. The results also show that the CATT and MAX may be also most powerful for some ?0 outside of the two ordered ranges.  NUMERICAL RESULTS Table 2 reports the results from a simulation study to examine how often the data-driven scores ( x 0 * , x 1 * , x 2 * ) are ordered when the true GRRs are ordered. We chose ?0 = ?/(2?) ? [0, 1] with increments of 0.001 for a genetic model and ? = 1.0 for the alternative hypothesis. The sample sizes were r = s = 150 with a minor allele frequency of 0.3. The frequency that the scores ( x 0 * , x 1 * , x 2 * ) are ordered, denoted by freq , was estimated using 1,000 replicates. Results in Table 2 show that the frequencies with the ordered scores ( x 0 * , x 1 * , x 2 * ) are usually higher when the true GRRs are ordered (order = yes). Figure 2 shows the box plots of the frequencies of ordered data-driven scores when the true GRRs are ordered or not. We noticed that when the true GRRs are ordered, the frequency of ordered data-driven scores ranges from 48.2% (in Table 2 ) to 99.7% with a mean and median frequencies of 79.2% and 77.0%, and a standard deviation of 15.4% (data not shown). Table 3 reports some of the simulated powers of the three test statistics given ?0 ? [0, 1] or ? ? [0, 2?]. The genotype counts ( r 0, r 1, r 2) in cases and ( s 0, s 1, s 2) in controls were simulated from the multinomial distributions Mul ( r;p 0, p 1, p 2) and Mul ( s; q 0, q 1, q 2), respectively, where p i = pr( G i ) f i / k and q i = pr( G i )(1 ? f i )/(1 ? k ) for i = 0, 1, 2, and k is the disease prevalence. Genotype frequencies q i = pr( G i ) were calculated under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for a given minor allele frequency. Under H 0, f 0 = f 1 = f 2 = k and p i = q i = pr( G i ) for all i = 0, 1, 2. Under H 1, (?1, ?2) were obtained given (?, ?). Then, f 0 = k /{pr( G 0) + ?1pr( G 1) + ?2pr( G 2)}, f 1 = ?1 f 0 and f 2 = ?2 f 0 were calculated. Finally, the probabilities p i and q i were calculated. In all simulations, k and the minor allele frequency were fixed. We chose k = 0.1 and minor allele frequencies p = 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5. We first simulated data under H 0 so that the critical values for the three test statistics were determined. The sample sizes are r = s = 150. The critical values for the three statistics (Pearson’s test, the trend test and MAX) were determined using 100,000 replicates. Then we simulated data under H 1 and estimated the power using 10,000 replicates and the previously simulated critical values. The sample sizes for the power comparison were also r = s = 150. All test statistics have good control of Type I errors using this Monte-Carlo simulation approach (results not shown). In Table 3 , ? = 1. The largest power among the three tests is highlighted (in some cases, the second largest power is also highlighted when the difference of power is less than 0.1%). We see that, in the top panel in Table 3 (for the ordered GRRs), either the CATT or MAX is most powerful, and Pearson’s test is usually less powerful, in particular that MAX is always more powerful than Pearson’s test when ?0 ? [0.125,0.250] corresponding to the ordered GRRs with ? ? [?/4,?/2]. (Note that when ?0 ? [0.625,0.750] or ? ? [5?/4, 3?/2], the genetic model is also ordered.) The CATT is often most powerful for ?0 in the middle around the additive model (?0 = 0.176 with (?1, ?2) = (1.448,1.894)), while MAX is often most powerful for the models around the recessive model (?0 = 0.250 with (?1, ?2) = (1, 2)) and the dominant model (?0 = 0.125 with (?1, ?2) = (1.707,1.707)). On the other hand, when the GRRs are not ordered (the bottom panel), i.e. ?0 ? [0.125, 0.250], we only present some results for ?0 ? [0.275, 0.400]. When the GRRs are not ordered, Pearson’s test is always most powerful under the models of consideration, while the CATT loses substantial power when the ordered scores are still used. For minor allele frequency p = 0.3 and ? = 0.8, the maximum power of the three test statistics was chosen over all values of ?0 ? [0,1] and plotted in Figure 3 , where D (?0 = 0.125 with (?1, ?2) = (1.566,1.566) and 0.625 with (?1,?2) = (0.434,0.434)), A (?0 = 0.176 with (?1, ?2) = (1.359,1.715) and 0.676 with (?1, ?2) = (0.641, 0.285)) and R (?0= 0.25 with (?1, ?2) = (0,1.8) and 0.75 with (?1, ?2) = (0,0.2)) stand for the dominant, additive and recessive models, respectively. Figure 3 shows that within the range from the recessive model to the dominant model (?0 ? [0.125, 0.250]) or in the range from the dominant model to the recessive model (?0 ? [0.625, 0.750]), either the CATT or MAX is most powerful. The CATT is most powerful when the genetic model is close to the additive to the dominant models while MAX is most powerful when the genetic model is close to the recessive. Pearson’s test is often most powerful outside of the two ordered ranges. The results also show that the CATT and MAX may be also most powerful for some ?0 outside of the two ordered ranges.  DISCUSSION We provided comparisons among the three commonly used test statistics for case-control genetic association studies: Pearson’s Chi-square test, the Cochran-Armitage trend test and MAX. We showed that Pearson’s test is just a trend test with unrestricted data-driven scores, compared to the trend test using prespecified scores. In addition, we showed that MAX captures all information contained in Pearson’s test when the data-driven scores used by Pearson’s test are ordered or restricted. These comparisons provide us insights into the power performance among the three statistics. It explains the trade-off in power and robustness between Pearson’s test and the trend test, and also explains why MAX is always more powerful than Pearson’s test when the underlying genetic model is restricted to the family of genetic models between the recessive model and the dominant model. Similar conclusions can be obtained when MAX3 ( Freidlin et al. 2002 ; Gonzalez et al. 2008 ) is used. In practice, if we know a genetic model, we should choose the trend test corresponding to that model. Also, if we know the scientifically plausible model is restricted to the genetic models between the recessive model and the dominant model, MAX should be used. On the other hand, if the genetic model outside of the above range is likely, e.g. the overdominant model, we should consider Pearson’s test. Recently, WTCCC (2007) proposed a new test statistic for genome-wide association studies, which takes the minimum of the p-values for the trend test optimal for the additive model and Pearson’s test. This robust test, referred to as MIN2 in Joo et al. (2008) , utilizes the strength of both the trend test and Pearson’s test to resolve the trade-off between them. The asymptotic null distribution for MIN2 is reported in Joo et al. (2008) together with the power comparison between MIN2 and MAX3.

Proof of Result 1 The proof is given for any 2 × K table ( K ? 3). Denote the first row of a 2 × K table by ( n 11,…, n 1 K ) with the total n 1· and the second row by ( n 21,…, n 2 K ) with the total n 2·. The column totals are denoted by n ·1,…, n · K . The grand total is n ·· = n 1· + n 2·. Denote ? i = n i· / n ·· , p? kj = n ij / n i· , and p ¯ j = n . j / n ? = ? i = 1 2 ? i p ^ i j . Pearson’s test for association, denoted by T ?

From ?1 p? 1 j / p? j + ?2 p? 2 j / p? j it follows (5) ? 1 ? j p ^ 1 j ( p ^ 1 j ? p ^ 2 j ) p ¯ j + ? 2 ? j p ^ 2 j ( p ^ 1 j ? p ^ 2 j ) p ¯ j = ? j ( p ^ 1 j ? p ^ 2 j ) = 0. Therefore, we find ? 1 ? j p ^ 1 j ( p ^ 1 j ? p ^ 2 j ) p ¯ j = ? 2 ? j ( p ^ 1 j ? p ^ 2 j ) 2 ? p ^ 1 j ( p ^ 1 j ? p ^ 2 j ) p ¯ j , where the right hand side is ??2 ? j { p? 2 j ( p? 1 j ? p? 2 j ) / p? j }. Thus, the claim follows from ?j { p? 1 j ( p? 1 j ? p? 2 j )} / p? j = ??2 ? j {( p? 1 j ( p? 2 j )2} / p? j . The CATT in (1) is T CATT ( x 0 , x 1 , x 2 ) = n ? { ? j x j ( n 1 j / n 1 . ) ? ? j x j ( n . j / n ? ) } 2 ( n 2 . / n 1 . ) [ ? j x j 2 ( n . j / n ? ) ? { ? j x j ( n . j / n ? ) } 2 ] . where x 0 = 0, x 1 = x , and x 2 = 1. For the 2 × K table, the data-driven scores are x 1 * = ( n 1 j / n 1 . ) ( n 1 . / n ? ) ( n ? / n . j ) = p ^ 1 j ? 1 / p ¯ j . Note that ? j x j * ( n 1 j / n 1 . ) = ? 1 ? j ( p ^ 1 j 2 / p ¯ j ) and ? j x j * ( n . j / n ? ) = ? 1 . . Further, p? 1 j ? p? j = ?2 ( p? 1 j ? p? 2 j ). Thus, ? j x j * ( n 1 j / n 1 . ) ? ? j x j * ( n . j / n ? ) = ? 1 ? j p ^ 1 j ( p ^ 1 j ? p ¯ j ) / p ¯ j . . Hence the numerator of T CATT( x 0, x 1, x 2) using x * can be written as (6) n ? ? 1 2 ? 2 2 { ? j p ^ 1 j ( p ^ 1 j ? p ^ 2 j ) p ¯ j } 2 . Also, since ? j ( x j * ) 2 ( n . j / n ? ) = ? 1 2 ? j ( p ^ 1 j 2 / p ¯ j ) , the denominator of T CATT( x 0, x 1, x 2) using x * can be written as (7) ? 1 ? 2 ( ? j p ^ 1 j 2 / p ¯ j ? 1 ) = ? 1 ? 2 ? j p ^ 1 j ( p ^ 1 j ? p ¯ j ) p ¯ j = ? 1 ? 2 2 ? j p ^ 1 j ( p ^ 1 j ? p ^ 2 ) p ¯ j .

(1992) considered MAX of one-sided asymptotically normally distributed trend test over x ? [0, 1]. From Kimeldorf et al. (1992) , when r 0/ r ? s 0/ s and r 2/ r ? s 2/ s , cases are stochastically greater than controls and, for any x ? [0, 1], the one-sided trend test is non-negative. On the other hand, when r 0/ r ? s 0/ s and r 2/ r ? s 2/ s , cases are stochastically smaller than controls. Then the trend test is non-positive for any x ? [0, 1]. In this case, we can switch the two alleles. Since we consider two-sided trend tests, we do not need to consider this case. If cases are neither stochastically greater nor smaller than the controls, they are incomparable. Then there exists x ? [0, 1] such that the trend test equals 0. Based on the results of Kimeldorf et al. (1992) , MAX (two-sided) is reached using the scores r 0/ n 0, r 1/ n 1, and r 2/ n are used in the trend test when the scores are ordered (increasing or decreasing); otherwise the pool adjacent violators algorithm (PAVA) can be applied to find MAX. The PAVA would pool the two adjacent columns into a single column. Thus, the same score will be given to the two pooled columns. For a 2 × 3 table, this is equivalent to using scores (0, 0, 1) if the first two columns are pooled or (0, 1, 1) if the last two columns are pooled. Note that these two scores are also “extreme” scores, corresponding to the two boundaries of the genetic models.  Proof of Result 2 Kimeldorf et al.

[0, 2?]. The GRRs are calculated based on ?1 = 1 + cos ? and ?2 = 1 + sin ?. ?0 ? ?1 ?2 freq ordered 0 0 2.000 1.000 5.1% no 0.125 ?/4 1.707 1.707 48.2% yes 0.200 2?/5 1.309 1.951 77.6% yes 0.500 ? 0.000 1.000 0.0% no 0.625 5?/4 0.293 0.293 50.4% yes 0.700 7?/5 0.691 0.049 98.0% yes 0.800 8?/5 1.309 0.049 22.3% no Table 3 Empirical powers (%) for the three test statistics when GRRs are ordered or not ordered: minor allele frequencies p = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5, prevalence 0.1, sample sizes r = s = 150, the alternative is specified by ? = 1 and k = 0.1. The results are based on 10,000 replicates. The genetic model is specified by ?0 = ?/2?. The recessive, additive, and dominant models correspond to ?0 =0.25, 0.176, and 0.125. The GRRs are ordered if ?0 ? [0.125, 0.250]; otherwise the GRRs are not ordered. The highlighted powers are the most or nearly most powerful among the tests under comparison GRRs p = 0.1 p = 0.3 p = 0.5 ?0 (?1, ?2) CATT MAX T ? 2 2 CATT MAX T ? 2 2 CATT MAX T ? 2 2 0.125 (1.71,1.71) 45.4 45.7 44.9 61.7 63.2 61.4 36.4 45.4 42.4 0.150 (1.59,1.81) 38.6 38.4 36.9 60.2 58.1 54.6 46.8 47.2 43.0 0.176 (1.45,1.89) 29.6 29.4 27.8 57.3 52.6 47.9 56.9 52.5 47.1 0.200 (1.31,1.95) 21.5 21.6 19.9 52.3 48.4 42.8 64.1 60.3 55.2 0.250 (0.00,2.00) 7.4 9.5 9.6 36.0 50.3 48.4 74.8 82.3 80.8 0.275 (0.84,1.99) 6.5 10.6 14.0 26.7 58.9 64.1 77.9 90.7 91.4 0.300 (0.69,1.95) 12.3 19.0 26.0 15.6 67.3 80.9 80.5 97.0 98.1 0.325 (0.55,1.89) 25.5 35.1 44.0 8.0 79.9 94.6 80.4 99.2 99.8 0.350 (0.41,1.81) 42.4 53.3 59.6 4.6 91.3 99.5 78.6 99.2 100. 0.400 (0.19,1.59) 65.4 69.5 70.1 22.2 99.9 99.9 65.1 100. 100.
