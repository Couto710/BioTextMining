Platelet count and the risk for thrombosis and death in the elderly Aim Our aim was to examine the association between platelet count and the incidence of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, venous thrombosis, and mortality. Methods and results Platelet count was measured at baseline in 1989-1990 and at three years follow-up, or at baseline (for a newly recruited group) in 1992-1993 in 5766 community-dwelling individuals aged 65 years and older (mean age at baseline, 73 years). During 12 to 15 years of follow-up, there were 821 incident myocardial infarctions, 807 ischemic strokes, 161 hemorrhagic strokes, 159 venous thrombotic events, and 3413 participants died. Platelet count was not associated with the occurrence of myocardial infarction, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, venous thrombosis, or cardiovascular mortality. Non-cardiovascular mortality was higher among both participants with low and with high platelet count. Adjusted non-cardiovascular mortality rates for platelet counts below 100, 100 to 199, 300 to 399, and above 400 X109/l relative to the reference mortality rate in participants with platelet count values between 200 and 299 X109/l were 1.89 (1.21-2.96),1.08 (0.98-1.20), 1.20 (1.06-1.37), and 1.47 (1.14-1.90), respectively. Comment Platelet counts were not associated with vascular outcomes but low and high platelet counts were associated with non-cardiovascular mortality including cancer mortality.  Introduction Platelets are anucleate megakaryocyte fragments circulating in the blood. They are involved in the cellular mechanisms of primary hemostasis leading to the formation of blood clots. A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 400,000 platelets per cubic millimeter (150 to 400 X109 / liter).[ 1 ] Low numbers of circulating platelets as well as platelet dysfunction increase the risk of bleeding. In patients with myeloproliferative disorders such as essential thrombocythemia, high levels of platelets have been associated with thrombotic and, to a lesser extent with hemorrhagic complications, mostly at platelet counts exceeding 600 x 109/l. There are, however, a few reports of such conditions at considerably lower platelet levels.[ 2 - 4 ] It is not clear whether these conditions can be ascribed to the high platelet counts or to other conditions associated with platelet count changes in these patients. Our aim was to examine the association between platelet count and the incidence of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, venous thrombosis and mortality in a cohort of elderly individuals.  Methods and results Platelet count was measured at baseline in 1989-1990 and at three years follow-up, or at baseline (for a newly recruited group) in 1992-1993 in 5766 community-dwelling individuals aged 65 years and older (mean age at baseline, 73 years). During 12 to 15 years of follow-up, there were 821 incident myocardial infarctions, 807 ischemic strokes, 161 hemorrhagic strokes, 159 venous thrombotic events, and 3413 participants died. Platelet count was not associated with the occurrence of myocardial infarction, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, venous thrombosis, or cardiovascular mortality. Non-cardiovascular mortality was higher among both participants with low and with high platelet count. Adjusted non-cardiovascular mortality rates for platelet counts below 100, 100 to 199, 300 to 399, and above 400 X109/l relative to the reference mortality rate in participants with platelet count values between 200 and 299 X109/l were 1.89 (1.21-2.96),1.08 (0.98-1.20), 1.20 (1.06-1.37), and 1.47 (1.14-1.90), respectively.  Comment Platelet counts were not associated with vascular outcomes but low and high platelet counts were associated with non-cardiovascular mortality including cancer mortality.  Methods Study design and population The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a longitudinal cohort of adults over the age of 65 years. CHS study design and participant recruitment are described in detail elsewhere.[ 5 ] Briefly, 5201 individuals from random samples of Medicare eligibility lists in four US communities were recruited in 1989–1990. In 1992–1993, a supplemental cohort of 687 self-identified African-Americans was recruited. Eligible were persons who were 65 years or older at the time of examination, were non-institutionalized, were expected to remain in the area for the next three years, and were able to give informed consent and did not require a proxy respondent at baseline. Individuals who were receiving radiation therapy or chemotherapy for cancer at baseline, wheelchair-bound in the home or receiving hospice treatment were excluded. The study was approved by institutional review boards at each site, and the participants gave informed consent. Participants were excluded from the present analysis if platelet count had not been measured (n=122) leaving 4861 white, 868 black, and 37 ‘other-race’ participants. Measurements and follow-up Participants underwent annual evaluations including assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, measurement of seated blood pressure and venipuncture, performed after an overnight fast.[ 5 ] Platelet counts were measured in 1989-1990 and in 1992-1993. Platelet counts and white blood cell counts were measured at field center laboratories by Coulter counters. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure >=140, or diastolic blood pressure >=90, or a physician diagnosis of hypertension along with use of antihypertensive medication. Diabetes mellitus was defined as diabetes according to the 1997 American Diabetes Association criteria (fasting glucose >=126 mg/dL or receiving diabetes medications).[ 6 ] The clinic visits alternated with phone contacts every six months for up to eleven years of follow-up. Hospital records were obtained for all hospitalizations, and cardiovascular events and deaths were adjudicated by committee. Autopsy and coroner reports, when available, were also obtained for fatal events. Films and ECG tracings were forwarded to the appropriate CHS Events Committee for incident and fatal events for interpretation. The CHS Events Committee reviewed and classified all deaths according to the underlying cause.[ 7 ] A coronary event was defined as incident fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke as incident fatal or nonfatal ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke as incident fatal or nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke, deep venous thrombosis[ 8 ; 9 ] as incident deep venous thrombosis or fatal or nonfatal pulmonary embolism, mortality as all cause death, cancer mortality as deaths due to cancer, and non-cardiovascular mortality as all deaths due to non-cardiovascular causes. Statistical analyses Platelet count was categorized in five categories: 48 (lowest observed value) to 99 X 109/l, 100 to 199 X 109/l, 200 to 299 X 109/l, 300 to 399 X 109/l, and 400 to 1223 (highest observed value) X 109/l. In addition, platelet count was categorized according to quintiles of the distribution of platelet count in the total study population; findings from the latter analyses are presented in the appendix . Hazard rate ratios (HR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models with platelet counts and potential confounders modeled as time-varying exposures, updated at the follow-up visit in 1992-1993. Depending on the endpoint studied, participants were censored at (1) death attributable to causes other than the one studied in the particular analysis, (2) loss to follow-up (n = 237 (4.0 % of 5888) after 12-15 years of follow-up), or (3) June 30, 2005 for all endpoints except venous thrombotic events where Dec 31 2001 was the censoring date. Multivariate models included sex, race (white versus non-white), and time-dependent variables for age, body mass index, current smoking, hypertension, use of aspirin (more than twice during the last two weeks), total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein (CRP), to provide adjusted hazard rate ratios. We presumed platelet count could be elevated as a marker of inflammation. We therefore examined the association between platelet count and non-cardiovascular mortality in models both with and without white blood cell count and CRP. Because of the observed differences in platelet count of men and women, we separately examined the association between platelet count and non-cardiovascular death among men and women and tested whether interaction terms for sex and categories of platelet count were statistically significant, with a 0.05 type I error. For the analysis of each end point, we excluded participants with a history of that end point at baseline; 549 participants had a history of myocardial infarction, 240 had a history of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), and 344 had a history of venous thrombosis.

Results Platelet count and cardiovascular risk factors In the 5766 participants included in the analysis, platelet counts ranged between 48 and 1223 X109/l; the mean was 250 X109/l, and 95 percent of platelet counts were between 102 to 398 X109/l. 3977 participants had a second platelet count measurement three years after baseline. Pearson's correlation coefficient between first and second measurement was 0.69, p<0.001. 65% of all patients with two platelet count measurement remained in the same category. Women had higher platelet counts than men, mean 264 X109/l (95% confidence interval (CI) 261 to 266 X109/l) and mean 232 X109/l (CI 229 to 235 X109/l) respectively. Table 1 presents levels of thrombotic risk factors according to categories of baseline platelet counts. Smokers had higher mean platelet counts than non-smokers, 261 (CI 255 to 267) X109/l and 249 (CI 247 to 251) X109/l, respectively. High total, LDL and HDL cholesterol levels were all associated with increased platelet counts ( Table 1 ). High C-reactive protein levels were associated with increased platelet counts; participants with C-reactive protein concentrations between 0 and 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and higher than 3 mg/l had mean platelet counts of 238, 243, 249 and 259 X109/l, respectively. There was no difference in platelet count between participants who used aspirin and those who did not use aspirin, and age was not associated with platelet count. Platelet count and incident thrombotic events During 12 to 15 years of follow-up, there were 821 incident myocardial infarctions, 807 ischemic strokes, 161 hemorrhagic strokes, and 159 venous thrombotic events, and 3413 participants died. Table 2 presents the association between platelet count and the occurrence of these outcomes. Platelet count was not associated with occurrence of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or venous thrombotic events. Platelet count and mortality Mortality was higher both in participants with low and with high platelet counts compared to those with platelet counts between 200 and 299 X109/l. While this association was attenuated after adjustment for potential confounders, participants with platelet counts between 300 and 399 X109/l, and those with counts above 400 X109/l had higher mortality rates than participants with platelet counts between 200 and 299 X109/l (Hazard ratio 1.13 (CI 1.02-1.25) and 1.28 (CI 1.04-1.57), respectively). We separately examined the association of platelet count with death due to cardiovascular causes, with death due to cancer and with death due to other (i.e. non-cardiovascular and non-cancer) causes ( Table 2 ). The association between platelet count and mortality appeared to be completely due to an association with non-cardiovascular causes of death. Adjusted cardiovascular mortality rates for platelet counts below 100, 100 to 199, 300 to 399, and above 400 X109/l relative to the reference mortality rate in participants with platelet count values between 200 and 299 X109/l were 0.95 (CI 0.80-1.12), 0.91 (CI 0.77-1.08), 0.85 (CI 0.71-1.02), and 1.00 (CI 0.84-1.19), respectively. In the subgroup of 3820 participants who were not using regular aspirin at baseline, adjusted relative hazard ratios for cardiovascular death were 0.75 (CI 0.31-1.83), 1.06 (CI 0.90-1.26), 1.02 (CI 0.82-1.25), and 1.05 (CI 0.67-1.67), respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders, non-cardiovascular mortality rates for platelet counts below 100, 100 to 199, 300 to 399, and above 400 X109/l relative to the reference group of participants with platelet count values between 200 and 299 X109/l were 1.89 (CI 1.21-2.96),1.08 (CI 0.98-1.20), 1.20 (CI 1.06-1.37), and 1.47 (CI 1.14-1.90), respectively. Similar patterns were observed for deaths due to cancer and for deaths due to non-cardiovascular non-cancer causes (presented in Table 2 ). Findings were similar for deaths occurring during the first three years after assessment of platelet count and deaths occurring after that period; if anything, associations with low and high platelet counts were more pronounced for deaths occurring after three years (data not shown). The association between platelet count and non-cardiovascular death was similar among men and women (data not shown).

Adjusted cardiovascular mortality rates for platelet counts below 100, 100 to 199, 300 to 399, and above 400 X109/l relative to the reference mortality rate in participants with platelet count values between 200 and 299 X109/l were 0.95 (CI 0.80-1.12), 0.91 (CI 0.77-1.08), 0.85 (CI 0.71-1.02), and 1.00 (CI 0.84-1.19), respectively. In the subgroup of 3820 participants who were not using regular aspirin at baseline, adjusted relative hazard ratios for cardiovascular death were 0.75 (CI 0.31-1.83), 1.06 (CI 0.90-1.26), 1.02 (CI 0.82-1.25), and 1.05 (CI 0.67-1.67), respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders, non-cardiovascular mortality rates for platelet counts below 100, 100 to 199, 300 to 399, and above 400 X109/l relative to the reference group of participants with platelet count values between 200 and 299 X109/l were 1.89 (CI 1.21-2.96),1.08 (CI 0.98-1.20), 1.20 (CI 1.06-1.37), and 1.47 (CI 1.14-1.90), respectively. Similar patterns were observed for deaths due to cancer and for deaths due to non-cardiovascular non-cancer causes (presented in Table 2 ). Findings were similar for deaths occurring during the first three years after assessment of platelet count and deaths occurring after that period; if anything, associations with low and high platelet counts were more pronounced for deaths occurring after three years (data not shown). The association between platelet count and non-cardiovascular death was similar among men and women (data not shown).  Discussion In this study, differences in platelet count were not associated with the risk of myocardial infarction, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, venous thrombosis, or cardiovascular mortality. However, both high and low platelet counts predicted non-cardiovascular mortality (including cancer mortality) independent of other risk factors including inflammation markers. Thrombocytosis and thrombocytopenia have been associated with the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. Findings among patients with mild thrombocytosis suggested that high-normal platelet count is associated with the occurrence of thrombotic events.[ 2 - 4 ] Among patients with acute myocardial infarction, higher platelet counts on presentation were associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, and among the same patients a decrease in platelet count from baseline was associated with a higher risk of reinfarction.[ 10 ] Thrombocytopenia in patients with acute coronary syndromes treated with hirudin or heparin had a graded positive association with adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality.[ 11 ] In a large study among patients with secondary thrombocytosis, thrombotic events were restricted to the venous system and occurred only in the presence of other risk factors.[ 12 ] A few reports of population-based studies reported that platelet count was not associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular events, but none of these studies showed detailed findings.[ 13 - 17 ] From these reports, it is not clear whether a non-linear association between platelet count and events was examined. Our findings in a detailed analysis suggest that both high and low platelet counts, within the normal range in otherwise healthy participants, are not related to the risk of arterial or venous thrombosis, or to the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, but that they are related to non-cardiovascular mortality. In contrast to cardiovascular mortality, cancer mortality was associated with higher platelet counts (greater than 300 x 109/l). This observation is consistent with several studies that have demonstrated an association between thrombocytosis and poor prognosis in a number of solid tumor types including gynecological, colon, renal and gastric cancer.[ 18 - 21 ] At least part of the observed increase in mortality in patients with cancer is likely due to the fundamental role of platelets in promoting tumor metastasis and invasion as well as angiogenesis.(reviewed in[ 22 ; 23 ]) In murine models, decreased platelet counts and anti-platelet agents have been found to reduce metastasis.[ 24 ; 25 ] The mechanism of thrombocytosis in patients with cancer is incompletely elucidated and host responses to malignancy as well tumor secretion of humoral factors and cytokines have been suggested.[ 26 ; 27 ] In both cases, the presence of tumor is required. In our study, higher platelet counts might be interpreted as reflective of underlying, undiagnosed malignancy although we can not exclude alternate hypotheses such as an increased risk of metastasis and death when cancer develops in individuals with high platelet counts. We were unable to discern if the association between platelet count and cancer mortality is related to an increase in cancer incidence or an increase in cancer death. Nevertheless, given the increasing burden of cancer in the elderly, the association between platelet counts and cancer mortality is deserving of further and confirmatory study. Like thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia was also associated with an increase in cancer mortality. A mechanistic explanation for cancer related mortality in association with low platelet counts is likely different from that seen with high platelet counts. An association with low platelet counts might be explained by thrombocytopenia due to underlying illnesses with an increased risk of malignancy. Diseases such as myelodysplastic syndrome are not uncommon in the elderly and may transform to acute leukemia in a subset of patients. Other causes of thrombocytopenia such as underlying liver disease also carry an increased risk of malignancy, for example due to active hepatitis C. In addition, undiagnosed coagulopathies may lead to thrombocytopenia and reflect underlying malignancy prior to clinical symptoms. Alternatively, the thrombocytopenia may be reflective of medication use in the population or the presence of undiagnosed malignancy involving the bone marrow. The strengths of this analysis include the large population-based sample of white and black participants and careful ascertainment of risk factors and cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, the number of participants with platelet counts below 100 or above 400 X109/l was low. We therefore base our conclusions primarily on the findings in participants with platelet counts between 100 and 400 X109/l. Findings in the extreme groups suggest that there may be a higher risk of ischemic stroke and venous thrombosis events among participants with platelet counts above 400 X109/l. Our study lacked the power to further investigate this. In addition, the sizes of the hazard ratios are insufficient to merit use of platelet count as a screening tool for cancer risk. In this study of the elderly, thrombotic and cerebral hemorrhagic risks were similar across the whole range of platelet counts between 100 and 400 X109/l. However, both low-normal and high-normal platelet counts were associated with increased non-cardiovascular mortality.
