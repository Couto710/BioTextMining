The role of moral objections to suicide in the assessment of suicidal patients Background Moral and religious objections to suicide (MOS) are reported to be associated with less suicidal behavior in depressed patients, and are proposed to act as a protective factor against suicidal behavior. It is unclear whether MOS are a protective factor against suicide attempt per se, or if this effect is mediated through other variables. Method Depressed inpatients ( n = 265) reporting low or high MOS were compared on history of suicidal behaviour, demographic and clinical characteristics. Results Patients with low MOS had significantly more lifetime suicide attempts, were more often without religious affiliation, had greater depression severity, hopelessness and trait impulsivity, less anxiety and fewer reasons for living. Logistic regression revealed that lower MOS was independently associated with suicide attempt. Conclusions Moral and religious objections to suicide may serve as a protective factor against suicidal acts given their unique association with less suicidal behavior in depressed inpatients.
