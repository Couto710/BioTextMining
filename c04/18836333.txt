Contemporary Renal Cell Cancer Epidemiology We analyzed renal cell cancer incidence patterns in the United States and reviewed recent epidemiologic evidence with regard to environmental and host genetic determinants of renal cell cancer risk. Renal cell cancer incidence rates continued to rise among all racial/ethnic groups in the United States, across all age groups, and for all tumor sizes, with the most rapid increases for localized stage disease and small tumors. Recent cohort studies confirmed the association of smoking, excess body weight, and hypertension with an elevated risk of renal cell cancer, and suggested that these factors can be modified to reduce the risk. There is increasing evidence for an inverse association between renal cell cancer risk and physical activity and moderate intake of alcohol. Occupational exposure to TCE has been positively associated with renal cell cancer risk in several recent studies, but its link with somatic mutations of the VHL gene has not been confirmed. Studies of genetic polymorphisms in relation to renal cell cancer risk have produced mixed results, but genome-wide association studies with larger sample size and a more comprehensive approach are underway. Few epidemiologic studies have evaluated risk factors by subtypes of renal cell cancer defined by somatic mutations and other tumor markers.  CONCLUSIONS Renal cell cancer incidence has continued to rise among all race/ethnic groups in the United States through 2005, and the increases were mostly due to localized disease and tumors of small size. Improved screening and incidental diagnosis may have contributed to these increases, but it has been estimated that most of the preclinical small tumors would become clinically evident eventually. The rising prevalences of obesity and hypertension likely have contributed to the upward cancer trends. Results from recent cohort studies, however, suggested that the obesity- and hypertension-related renal cell cancer risk may be tempered by effective hypertension control and reduced weight fluctuations. There is also increasing epidemiologic evidence that physical activity and moderate alcohol intake may reduce risk. Several recent investigations have confirmed an association between renal cell cancer risk and occupational exposure to TCE, although the link between high cumulative TCE exposure and somatic VHL mutation remains inconclusive. Epidemiologic investigations have increasingly incorporated analysis of germline and somatic mutations and assessed their interactions with environmental exposures in cancer risk. Polymorphisms in genes involved in a variety of pathways, including genes encoding metabolic enzymes, vitamin D receptor, DNA repair, and immune function, have been examined in relation to renal cell cancer risk, but the results have been mixed. Telomere shortening in peripheral blood DNA also has been linked to elevated risk in a dose-response manner, but it is unclear whether this association is modified by any environmental exposures. Somatic mutations of VHL and other genes have been observed in subtypes of renal cell cancer, but their link to environmental exposures has yet to be clarified. The recent rapid advancement in high-throughput laboratory technology, such as the genome-wide scanning, will allow for more thorough evaluation of molecular changes. In conjunction with detailed environmental exposure data in large epidemiologic studies, these technological innovations hold promise for novel discoveries in the etiology and prognosis of renal cell cancer.
