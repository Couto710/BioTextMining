Interaction between RANTES promoter variant and CCR5 ? 32 favors recovery from hepatitis B Recovery from acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection occurs in 95% of adult-acquired infections. A 32-base pair deletion in CCR5 (CCR5 ? 32) , which encodes for a nonfunctional receptor, increases the likelihood of recovery. Using 181 subjects with persistent HBV infection and 316 who had recovered, we tested the hypothesis that an epistatic interaction between functional polymorphisms in RANTES (a CCR5 ligand) and CCR5 impacts recovery. Specific models designed to assess individual contributions of compound genotypes demonstrated that the only combination associated with recovery from an HBV infection was RANTES -403A with CCR5 ? 32 (OR 0.36, P = 0.02). Since the phenotypic consequence of -403A is reported to be higher levels of RANTES, we propose a model where excess RANTES in combination with low CCR5 favor recovery from an HBV infection, which will require validation through functional testing. “This is an author-produced version of a manuscript accepted for publication in The Journal of Immunology (The JI).

However, approximately 5% of adults remain chronically infected with HBV and are at risk for developing end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma ( 1 ). Hepatitis B recovery occurs more often in individuals who develop a broad and strong T-cell response rather than in those with a weak and narrowly-focused response ( 2 ), but the genetic basis for differences in adaptive immunity remain poorly understood. CCR5 (chemokine receptor 5) influences the migration and activation of cells that express the receptor, including granulocytes, macrophages, immature dendritic cells, CD8+ lymphocytes, and Th1 lymphocytes ( 3 ). The gene encoding CCR5 consists of a single open reading frame producing a single transcript. Thus, a 32-base pair deletion ( CCR5 ? 32 ) in this gene leads to a functionally null allele, which was previously identified in 10-15% of Caucasians ( 4 ). We found this deletion to be associated with recovery from acute HBV infection ( 5 ). RANTES (CCL5), a ligand for CCR5, is a Th1 chemokine that promotes T-cell activation and proliferation. The binding of RANTES to its alternate receptor, CCR1, has been shown to upregulate the inflammatory response during sepsis ( 6 ) and to increase recruitment of natural killer cells to the liver in an autoimmune hepatitis mouse model ( 7 ). The RANTES gene has several known polymorphisms including two functional promoter polymorphisms at positions -403 (G?A) and -28 (C?G), both of which associate with increased RANTES expression ( 8 - 10 ). These variants have been associated with several diseases including HIV, asthma, sarcoidosis and type 1 diabetes ( 9 - 13 ). Haplotypes composed of these two polymorphisms along with two others, the intronic variant INT1.1 T?C and a 3' untranslated region variant 524 T?C, associate with levels of HIV RNA ( 14 ). We hypothesized that epistatic interactions between functional RANTES polymorphisms and CCR5 genotype may affect the likelihood of recovery from an acute HBV infection. In order to test this hypothesis, we genotyped the RANTES polymorphisms -403, -28, Int1.1 and 524 ( Figure 1 ) in our Caucasian cohort, which has well-defined HBV outcomes and known CCR5 genotypes from an earlier study ( 5 ).  Materials and Methods Study participants The subjects in this study were the same ones that we had previously genotyped for CCR5 ? 32 ( 5 ). They were Caucasian participants in one of the following ongoing studies: (i) Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), which is a study of 5622 gay men enrolled in one of four United States cities between 1984-1985 and between 1987-1991, ( 15 ) (ii) Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study, a prospectively-followed cohort of patients with hemophilia, von Willebrand's disease, or a related coagulation disorder from 16 comprehensive hemophilia treatment centers enrolled between 1982 and 1986, as previously described ( 16 ), and the Hemophilia Growth and Development Study (HGDS), which is a continuing study of 333 children and adolescents with hemophilia enrolled between March 1989 and May 1990 ( 17 ). The majority of the subjects were from the MACS cohort (80%) with the HGDS and MHCS each contributing 10%. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. To investigate our hypothesis, a nested case-control design was used in which all individuals who had a persistent hepatitis B infection from one of the above cohorts was matched to two persons, from the same cohort, who recovered from an HBV infection but were otherwise similar with regard to non-genetic factors. Matching criteria included geographic location and factors that have been associated with HBV recovery including age within 10 years, gender, and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) status ( 18 ). In this study, there were 190 subjects with a persistent HBV infection matched to 336 who had recovered; thus, for 44 persistently infected persons only one match was available. Of these, RANTES genotyping was successful in 181 and 316 individuals with viral persistence and recovery, respectively. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at participating institutions. Subjects were considered persistently infected with HBV if their serum or plasma tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at two visits separated by a minimum of six months. Testing for antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and HBsAg (anti-HBs) was performed as needed to exclude primary HBV infection. Individuals with HBV recovery were positive for anti-HBc and anti-HBs without the presence of HBsAg at two time points separated by a minimum of six months. All initial tests were performed on serum at the time of entry into the cohort study. HBV status of HIV-positive subjects was determined before antiretroviral therapy (including lamivudine) was available. Serologic testing All serum specimens were stored at -70° C prior to testing. HIV type 1 antibody testing was done by enzyme immunoassay with reactive results confirmed as positive by Western blotting ( 15 , 16 ). HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc testing was done using commercially available kits according to the manufacturer's specifications (AUSZYME, AUSAB, and CORZYME, respectively; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). RANTES genotyping For all the considered RANTES polymorphisms, samples were genotyped using a pre-developed TaqMan allelic discrimination assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCR was carried out with mixes consisting of 5 ng of genomic DNA, 2.5 ?l of Taqman master mix, 0.0625 ?l of 80x assay mix, and ddH2O up to 5 ?l of final volume. The following amplification protocol was used: denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 92°C for 15 sec and annealing and extension at 60°C for 1 min. After PCR, the genotype of each sample was attributed automatically by measuring the allelic specific fluorescence on the ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection Systems using the SDS 2.2.2 software for allelic discrimination (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). All polymorphisms in this study were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which was assessed for each SNP using the chi-square test with 1 degree of freedom. Allele frequencies for RANTES were calculated and compared between those with viral recovery and persistence using conditional logistic regression (SAS, version 10, Cary, NC). An odds ratio (OR) >1 was associated with persistence and <1 with recovery. RANTES haplotypes were inferred from the genotypes in the study population and were constructed using a program designed for population-based studies, PHASE v 2.0 ( http://www.stat.washington.edu/stephens/phase.html )( 19 )( Figure 1 ). P <0.05 was considered significant in all analyses. Specific models were constructed to determine individual contributions from genotypes combinations.  Study participants The subjects in this study were the same ones that we had previously genotyped for CCR5 ? 32 ( 5 ). They were Caucasian participants in one of the following ongoing studies: (i) Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), which is a study of 5622 gay men enrolled in one of four United States cities between 1984-1985 and between 1987-1991, ( 15 ) (ii) Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study, a prospectively-followed cohort of patients with hemophilia, von Willebrand's disease, or a related coagulation disorder from 16 comprehensive hemophilia treatment centers enrolled between 1982 and 1986, as previously described ( 16 ), and the Hemophilia Growth and Development Study (HGDS), which is a continuing study of 333 children and adolescents with hemophilia enrolled between March 1989 and May 1990 ( 17 ).

RANTES haplotypes were inferred from the genotypes in the study population and were constructed using a program designed for population-based studies, PHASE v 2.0 ( http://www.stat.washington.edu/stephens/phase.html )( 19 )( Figure 1 ). P <0.05 was considered significant in all analyses. Specific models were constructed to determine individual contributions from genotypes combinations.  Results No significant differences were detected between those with viral persistence and recovery in terms of the matched, non-genetic factors (median age of 31.5, 100% male, and 69% HIV-infected). None of the individual RANTES genotypes were associated with recovery from HBV infection ( Table 1 ). Homozygosity for these SNPs was also not associated with HBV outcomes (data not shown). Similarly, none of the RANTES haplotypes was significantly associated with HBV recovery; the haplotype -403A, -28G, In1.1C, 524T was more common in those with HBV recovery (OR 0.45), but it did not reach statistical significance ( P = 0.11). We next examined each of these RANTES SNPs in combination with CCR5 ? 32 or CCR5 wildtype ( WT ) using the CCR5 genotype data previously generated in the same cohort ( 5 ). For these univariate analyses, the reference group for each of these combinations included those with neither or only one of the genotypes in the combination. As expected from our prior study ( 5 ), most of the RANTES combinations with CCR5 ? 32 had ORs favoring HBV recovery (0.46-0.58) due to the favorable effect of CCR5 ? 32 ; however, two of the combinations had lower ORs ( Table 2 ). The presence of at least one copy of RANTES -403A , a SNP that leads to increased RANTES expression, in combination with CCR5 ? 32 had an OR for recovery from an HBV infection of 0.36 (95% CI 0.16-0.83, P = 0.02). The compound genotype RANTES 524C and CCR5 ? 32 had a similar OR of 0.38. Since RANTES 524C is always found with RANTES-403A ( Table 1 ) and the converse is not true, this finding with 524C is probably due to its tight linkage disequilibrium with RANTES -403A . In the univariate analysis of RANTES -403A and CCR5 ? 32 combination, the reference group included those with CCR5 ? 32 with the wild type RANTES ( -403G ) making it difficult to determine the independent associations of CCR5 ? 32 with the mutant and wild type RANTES -403 polymorphisms. In order to overcome this, we constructed a more specific model to determine the independent contribution of each genotype combination for these two polymorphisms. One combination served as the reference group and was composed of the individuals who were homozygous for the wild type RANTES ( -403G/G ) and the wild type CCR5 . The variables in the model were each of the other possible genotype combinations ( Table 3 ). We found that only individuals with both minor variants, RANTES -403A and CCR5 ? 32 , were significantly more likely to have HBV recovery (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16-0.85, P = 0.02). The combination of CCR5 wildtype and at least one copy of RANTES -403A was not associated with clearance (OR 1.37). Individuals with CCR5 ? 32 but no copies of RANTES -403A (i.e. -403G/G ) had an OR for recovery from an HBV infection that was intermediate between the other two (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.38-1.31, P = 0.26). Thus, in this model, having CCR5 ? 32 without the minor RANTES variant was no longer statistically significantly associated with HBV recovery. Likewise, the minor RANTES variant, -403A , without CCR5 ? 32 also was not associated with HBV outcome. When the other RANTES promoter polymorphisms were included in such a model, the combinations with CCR5 ? 32 were not significantly associated with HBV recovery (data not shown).  Results No significant differences were detected between those with viral persistence and recovery in terms of the matched, non-genetic factors (median age of 31.5, 100% male, and 69% HIV-infected).

When the other RANTES promoter polymorphisms were included in such a model, the combinations with CCR5 ? 32 were not significantly associated with HBV recovery (data not shown).  Discussion The data presented in this report demonstrate a protective epistatic effect of CCR5 ? 32 and RANTES -403A in recovery from a HBV infection. In our previous study that did not include RANTES polymorphisms (but used the same study subjects) ( 5 ), we demonstrated that CCR5 ? 32 conferred a protective effect against HBV. We now show that it is the combination of CCR5 ? 32 and RANTES -403A that is protective against this virus, where individuals with this compound genotype were nearly three times as likely to recover compared to those who had neither of these genotypes. Interestingly, RANTES -403A without the CCR5 ? 32 was not associated with HBV recovery and CCR5 ? 32 without RANTES -403A showed only weak, non-significant protection. This is the first demonstration of an interactive effect between a RANTES and CCR5 compound genotype, one that makes sense given the receptor/ligand relationship of these two molecules. We cannot totally eliminate the possibility that the interaction with CCR5 ? 32 is due to RANTES 524C rather than RANTES -403A, since RANTES 524C is in tight linkage disequilibrium with RANTES -403A . Two other studies have examined the effects of RANTES promoter polymorphisms on HBV outcomes, but neither looked at interactive effects with CCR5 genotypes. In a Korean study, 350 people with HBV recovery and 607 with a persistent HBV infection were genotyped for the -403 RANTES polymorphism, but no association was present ( 20 ). A second Korean study genotyped the -28 polymorphism in addition to the -403 and no association was detected ( 21 ). These data are consistent with our data in that we did not see an association with HBV clearance without the presence of CCR5 ? 32 , an allele that is virtually missing in Asian populations. HIV co-infection in nearly 70% of our subjects was carefully considered in our study, as CCR5 ? 32 and RANTES polymorphisms are known to affect HIV outcomes. In our previous study, we found that the association with CCR5 ? 32 and HBV recovery was not affected by HIV status ( 5 ). In our current study, we also conclude that the effect of CCR5 ? 32 and RANTES -403A on HIV infection cannot explain the effect of these variants on HBV recovery based on the following: 1) those with viral recovery and persistence were matched on HIV status in our study and 2) HBV infection occurred prior to HIV infection in nearly all cases, so the outcome of HBV infection (i.e. clearance/persistence) is determined prior to acquiring HIV ( 22 ). For those few cases in which the HIV infection did occur first, it is unlikely that immunosuppression from HIV played a significant role in these results since the HBV status was determined at study entry, prior to clinical HIV-induced immunosuppression. Of note, the status of the HBV infection was established prior to availability of oral antiretroviral agents with activity against both HIV and HBV; thus none of the individuals had been treated for HIV or HBV prior to the time the HBV infection status was determined. It is intriguing to consider why the compound genotype of CCR5 ? 32 and the RANTES - 403A would enhance recovery from an HBV infection since CCR5 is not a receptor for HBV. Characteristics of the cellular and cytokine profiles in the Conconavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis mouse model give some clues to understanding this finding ( 7 ). In this model, natural killer (NK) cells do not infiltrate the liver in the wild type mouse upon Con A treatment, but they do accumulate in the liver of CCR5 deficient mice upon Con A treatment, a situation that would theoretically enhance an immune response and aid in the spontaneous recovery of HBV infection. The study showed that CCR5 deficiency associates specifically with elevated RANTES expression in the mouse liver but not that of other CCR5 ligands. The authors postulated that the increase in liver RANTES subsequently leads to enhanced interactions between this chemokine and its alternative receptor, CCR1, an interaction that results in recruitment of NK cells. Indeed, upon treatment of the mice with anti-RANTES antibody, there was a significantly reduced recruitment of NK cells into the liver after Con A administration. A second observation from the mouse work, potentially relating to HBV clearance, is that Con A treatment of CCR5 deficient mice leads to NK cell activation and subsequent production of interferon-gamma (If-gamma). Like the anti-RANTES treatment, treatment of the mice with anti-If-gamma monoclonal antibodies reduced cellular and cytokine responses in this model, underscoring the importance of If-gamma in the response. So, why do individuals with CCR5 ? 32 have an even further advantage when combined with RANTES -403A ? Data from cell lines demonstrate that the RANTES -403A promoter polymorphism leads to higher levels of RANTES expression ( 8 ). Thus, it is possible that individuals with the protective compound genotype may produce high amounts of RANTES in the liver upon infection with HBV, which is more likely to interact with CCR1 when CCR5 levels are low (i.e. presence of CCR5 ? 32 ), leading to an increase in NK cell recruitment to the liver. And, based on the enhanced If-gamma production in the absence of CCR5 in the mouse model, the decrease in CCR5 due to the presence of the null CCR5 ? 32 allele may lead to increased activation of the NK cells to produce If-gamma and thus aid in the immune response to HBV. A limitation to our study is that we were not able to obtain RANTES levels from the livers or serum of our participants at the time of their hepatitis B infection. It would be of particular interest to determine the level of CCL5 in liver tissue of patients with compared to those without the CCR5 ? 32 + RANTES -403A genotype since several mouse studies have demonstrated differences in CCL5 levels in affected tissues as opposed to systemic alterations ( 7 , 23 , 24 ). Liver biopsies are not performed on individuals who are disease-free (i.e. cleared the virus or have persistent infection without disease symptoms), so a hepatitis B transgenic mouse model may be required in order to approach such studies. In summary, these data are the first to demonstrate an epistatic effect of RANTES -403A and CCR5 ? 32 on the outcome of an infectious disease. Data from a mouse model provide a potential explanation for why this compound genotype favors recovery from HBV infection. If valid, the data would support an important role for NK cells in recovery from an HBV infection.  Discussion The data presented in this report demonstrate a protective epistatic effect of CCR5 ? 32 and RANTES -403A in recovery from a HBV infection. In our previous study that did not include RANTES polymorphisms (but used the same study subjects) ( 5 ), we demonstrated that CCR5 ? 32 conferred a protective effect against HBV.
