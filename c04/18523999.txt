Predicting Disease Progression After Nephrectomy for Localized Renal Cell Carcinoma: The Utility of Prognostic Models and Molecular Biomarkers Disease progression after nephrectomy for pathologically localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is associated with a significant mortality rate, given the limited efficacy of available treatment regimens for metastatic disease. As such, several adjuvant trials have been designed to treat patients at particularly high risk for post-surgical RCC progression. Several different prognostic models designed to identify patients at high risk of disease progression are available. Although these available predictive models provide a reasonable assessment of patients’ risks of disease progression, the accuracy of these models may further be improved via the incorporation of molecular prognostic biomarkers. Although numerous candidate molecules have been described, few have been specifically assessed for the association with disease progression after nephrectomy. IMP-3, CXCR3, p53, Survivin, cIAP1, B7-H1, and B7-H4 have all been associated with disease progression after nephrectomy. The incorporation of 1 or several of these biomarkers may increase the accuracy of currently available prognostic models and thereby facilitate the appropriate use of adjuvant therapies aimed at preventing future disease progression. As such, the authors review the current prognostic tools for predicting disease progression for localized RCC, and detail studies to date that have evaluated various biomarkers in this setting.  Conclusions Disease progression after nephrectomy for RCC continues to occur in a significant proportion of patients who have pathologically localized disease, and is associated with a significant mortality rate. As such, the need to accurately identify those patients at high risk for disease recurrence and subsequent progression, who might benefit from early intervention provided via enrollment onto a clinical adjuvant therapy trial, will prove vital to extending long-term survival of RCC patients. Although multiple current prognostic models based on clinicopathologic variables exist, further improvements in the accuracy of these models may be attained through the incorporation of molecular prognostic biomarkers. Such accuracy is particularly important when considering the potential morbidity of overtreating patients with adjuvant therapy who are not likely to experience disease progression or undertreating those patients who will certainly progress and die of their disease.
