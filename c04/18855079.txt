Generation of embryonic stem cells from mouse insulin I promoter-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice and characterization in a teratoma model Insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Potential new treatments for this disease include cell-replacement therapies using embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We have generated ESCs from a transgenic mouse model, mouse insulin 1 promoter (MIP)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) mice, in which embryonic and adult beta-cells are genetically tagged with GFP. The aim of the present study is to examine the differentiation potential of MIP-GFP ESCs in the microenvironment of the kidney capsule. The ESCs grew rapidly and formed a teratoma with GFP-expressing beta-like cells present in clusters that formed a cord-like structure similar to what is seen in the embryonic pancreas. These structures also included glucagon-expressing alpha-cells and amylase-expressing acinar cells. Electron microscopic analysis showed insulin-like granules in columnar epithelium with microvilli adjacent to exocrine-like granule containing cells. The MIP-GFP ESCs should be a useful research tool to study the differentiation capacity of ESCs towards pancreatic lineages.
