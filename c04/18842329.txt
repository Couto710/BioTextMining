Does performance on the standard antisaccade task meet the co-familiality criterion for an endophenotype? The “co-familiality” criterion for an endophenotype has two requirements: (1) clinically unaffected relatives as a group should show both a shift in mean performance and an increase in variance compared with controls; (2) performance scores should be heritable. Performance on the antisaccade task is one of several candidate endophenotypes for schizophrenia. In this paper we examine whether the various measures of performance on the standard version of the antisaccade task meet the co-familiality criterion for an endophenotype. The three measures of performance—reflexive saccade errors, latency of correct antisaccades, and gain—show a wide range of effect sizes and variance ratios as well as evidence of significant or near significant heterogeneity. The estimated mean effect sizes [Cohen's d : error rate: 0.34 ( SD : 0.29); latency: 0.33 ( SD : 0.30); gain: 0.54 ( SD : 0.38)] are significantly greater than 0, but the magnitude of the departures from 0 is relatively small, corresponding to modest effect sizes. The width of the 95% confidence intervals for the estimated effect sizes (error rate: 0.2?0.49; latency: 0.17?0.50; gain: 0.23?0.85) and the coefficients of variation in effect sizes (error rate: 85.3%; latency: 90.9%; gain: 68.4%) reflect heterogeneity in effect sizes. The effect sizes for error rate showed statistically significant heterogeneity and those for latency ( P = .07) and gain ( P = .09) showed a trend toward heterogeneity. These results indicate that the effect sizes are not consistent with a single mean and that the average effect size may be a biased estimate of the magnitude of differences in performance between relatives of schizophrenics and controls. Relatives of schizophrenics show a small but significant increase in variance in error rate, but the confidence interval is broad, perhaps reflecting the heterogeneity in effect size. The variance ratios for latency and gain did not differ in relatives of schizophrenics and controls. Performance, as measured by error rate, is moderately heritable. The data do not provide compelling support for a consistent shift in mean or variance in relatives of schizophrenia patients compared with nonpsychiatric controls, both of which are required for a major gene involved in co-familial transmission. This set of findings suggests that although intra-familial resemblance in antisaccade performance is due in part to genetic factors, it may not be related to a schizophrenia genotype. Based on the current literature, it would be premature to conclude that any of the measures of antisaccade performance unambiguously meets the co-familiality criterion for an endophenotype.  1. Introduction Gottesman and Gould (2003) define an endophenotype (see glossary) as a heritable trait that co-segregates with a disease, is state-independent, and has a significantly higher recurrence risk in unaffected relatives of individuals with the disease than in the general population. A primary rationale for incorporating endophenotypes into linkage studies (see glossary) is to improve power to detect common susceptibility alleles ( Holzman & Matthysse, 1990 ; Matthysse & Parnas, 1992 ). This improvement in power would occur because more accurate identification of non-penetrant gene carriers through a segregating endophenotype lowers the risk of false negatives ( Botstein & Risch, 2003 ; Matthysse & Parnas, 1992 ). Since endophenotypes also have a much higher recurrence than the disease in families with an affected individual ( Gottesman & Gould, 2003 ), a pleiotropic (see glossary) locus that is one of several for a complex disease would have a higher probability of being detected through its effect on a more penetrant endophenotype than through its effect on a less penetrant disease phenotype ( Freedman, Adler, & Leonard, 1999 ; Holzman, 1994 ; Holzman & Matthysse, 1990 ; Lander, 1988 ; Matthysse & Parnas, 1992 ). Endophenotypes are thought: (1) to be potentially closer to the biological actions of a single gene; (2) to have a simpler genetic architecture than complex diseases (i.e., are more likely to be monogenic); (3) to be useful for clarifying the neurobiological effects of genes and the pathophysiology of the disease; and (4) to provide a method for subtyping potentially more homogeneous forms of a clinical disorder ( Braff, Freedman, Schork, & Gottesman, 2007 ; Carlson, Eberle, Kruglyak, & Nickerson, 2004 ; Freedman et al., 1999 ; Gottesman & Gould, 2003 ; Holzman & Matthysse, 1990 ; Jablensky, 2006 ; Matthysse & Parnas, 1992 ; Szatmari et al., 2007 ). For more extensive discussions of endophenotypes, their value in genetic studies of schizophrenia, and their various definitions, (see also Adler, Freedman, Ross, Olincy, & Waldo, 1999 ; Almasy & Blangero, 2001 ; Bearden & Freimer, 2006 ; Calkins et al., this issue; Adler, Freedman, Ross, Olincy, & Waldo, 1999 ; Almasy & Blangero, 2001 ; Bearden & Freimer, 2006 ; Flint & Munafo, 2006 ; Glahn et al., 2007 ; Greenberg, 1992 ; Iacono, 1998 ; Keating et al., 1991 ; Keri & Janka, 2004 ; Leboyer et al., 1988 ; Meyer-Lindenberg & Weinberger, 2006 ; Thaker, 2008 ; Turetsky et al., 2007 ; Walters & Owen, 2007 ). The “co-familiality” criterion refers to whether a potential endophenotype is over-represented in clinically unaffected relatives of probands compared with nonpsychiatric controls. This over-representation can be reflected in a significant shift in the mean value for a quantitative trait or in a significant difference in the frequency of a qualitative trait compared with controls. Since first-degree relatives as a group are a mixture of gene carriers and non-gene carriers, the endophenotype would also be expected to have a larger variance in clinically unaffected relatives than in controls. The reason is that the subgroup of relatives with deviant performance, the putative gene carriers, would increase the variance for the group of relatives as a whole. Genes may or may not underlie the familial aggregation of a trait. As Seymour Kety was fond of noting, many things run in families—the silver, politics, religion—that do not have a genetic basis. For this reason it is also important to demonstrate that the trait thought to be an endophenotype shows familial aggregation because it is heritable. In addition, a trait may aggregate in families and be heritable, but not be related to risk for a disease genotype. In that case, the trait would show a significant within-family correlation but relatives of affected individuals would not show a shift in mean or an increase in variance. A number of candidate endophenotypes for schizophrenia have been provisionally identified. These include eye tracking dysfunction ( Levy, Holzman, Matthysse, & Mendell, 1993 ), decreased P50 inhibition ( Freedman et al., 1999 ), reduced P300 amplitude ( Hall et al., 2007 ), reflexive saccade errors on the antisaccade (AS) task ( Levy, Mendell, & Holzman, 2004a ), and a variety of neurocognitive measures ( Hallmayer et al., 2003 ). Poor performance on the antisaccade (AS) task is so strongly associated with schizophrenia that there has never been a failure to replicate (see section by Gooding et al., this issue). The strength of this association in a wide range of schizophrenia populations (acutely ill, remitted, first-episode, chronic) made it logical to assess whether poor performance on the AS task is also over-represented in clinically unaffected relatives of schizophrenics (RelSZ). Some studies (see below) have reported that unaffected RelSZ perform the AS task significantly worse than controls, a difference that has been interpreted as support for considering this trait to be a schizophrenia endophenotype. Other studies do not support the familial aggregation of poor performance in RelSZ or the usefulness of performance on this task as an endophenotype (see below). In this paper we examine the evidence as to whether the various measures of AS performance meet the co-familiality criterion for an endophenotype in biological RelSZ. If AS performance taps processes related to genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia, it must fulfill at least two criteria. First, genetic effects should contribute to variability in performance (i.e., it should be heritable). Second, clinically unaffected RelSZ as a group should show both a shift in mean performance and an increase in variance compared with controls that is independent of poor performance in RelSZ with diagnoses of schizophrenia, psychosis or schizophrenia spectrum personality disorders. The magnitude of this shift in mean and variance bears on how potentially useful an endophenotype is for identifying non-penetrant gene carriers. Evaluating the broader question of the endophenotype status of AS performance would be premature until the co-familiality criterion has been satisfactorily established.  2. The antisaccade task The AS task requires a subject to inhibit a visually guided saccade to a novel peripheral target, and instead, to generate a voluntary eye movement to the mirror image location in the contralateral visual field ( Hallett, 1978 ). This voluntary eye movement is the antisaccade. Performance is typically assessed using one or more of several dependent measures. The most widely used measure of performance is the proportion of pro-saccades to the novel peripheral target instead of away from it, the error rate. This score is thought to reflect a failure to inhibit prepotent responses to the target (see also ( Massen, 2004 ) for a different formulation) and is commonly interpreted to reflect an impairment in prefrontal cortical functioning (for a more extensive discussion of this interpretation, see ( Levy et al., 2004b )). Other measures of performance include latency (i.e., oculomotor reaction time) of correct and incorrect antisaccades and gain. Gain, sometimes also called accuracy, compares the amplitude of a correct antisaccade to the amplitude of the distance between central fixation and the mirror image location. In the most commonly used paradigm in studies of schizophrenia patients and their relatives, the standard AS task, the offset of the central fixation point occurs simultaneously with the onset of the peripheral target. Other variations include (1) the overlap paradigm (see glossary), in which the central fixation point remains illuminated for a short period of time after the peripheral target appears, and (2) the gap paradigm (see glossary), in which the central fixation point is extinguished shortly before the appearance of the novel peripheral target. Timing parameters and the number of eccentricities (e.g., one at ±10° versus several at ±5°, 10°, 15°) vary. In addition, sometimes the correct location for the antisaccade is illuminated at the end of each trial and sometimes it is not.  3. Family studies of antisaccade performance Based on a PubMed search of the literature, we identified 21 family studies of AS performance to date. Table 1 lists, in chronological order, the studies, their sample sizes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, type of AS paradigm used, and dependent measures. Primary findings with respect to RelSZ-nonpsychiatric control (NC) or sibling of schizophrenic (SibSZ)-NC comparisons are also briefly summarized in the table. Effect sizes, using Cohen's d ( Cohen, 1977 , 1988 ), r ( Rosenthal & Rosnow, 1984 ), and Glass’ delta ( Glass, 1976 ), are included. Cohen's d assumes equal variances [ d = (meanRelSZ – meanNC)/pooled standard deviation] and Glass’ delta [(meanRelSZ meanNC)/standard deviationNC] does not. When groups differ in variance, which would be expected if RelSZ are a mixture of gene carriers and non-gene carriers, Cohen's d will underestimate effect size relative to Glass’ delta. The effect size, r , is the correlation between group membership and performance. Seventeen of these 21 studies used a standard AS paradigm ( Boudet et al., 2005 ; Brownstein et al., 2003 ; Clementz, McDowell, & Zisook, 1994 ; Crawford, Sharma, Puri, Murray, & Lewis, 1998 ; Curtis, Calkins, Grove, Feil, & Iacono, 2001a ; Curtis, Calkins, & Iacono, 2001b ; de Wilde, Bour, Dingemans, Boeree, & Linszen, 2008 ; Ettinger et al., 2004 , 2006 ; Karoumi et al., 2001 ; Katsanis, Kortenkamp, Iacono, & Grove, 1997 ; Louchart-de la Chapelle et al., 2005 ; MacCabe et al., 2005 ; McDowell & Clementz, 1997 ; Price et al., 2005 ; Thaker, Cassady, Adami, Moran, & Ross, 1996 ; Thaker et al., 2000 ), sixteen of which involved independent samples (subjects included in the standard paradigm results reported in the Curtis et al. (2001b) study were a subset of those from the Curtis et al. (2001a) study data from the former study are not included in the discussion that follows). Two other studies used a gap paradigm only ( Raemaekers, Ramsey, Vink, van den Heuvel, & Kahn, 2006 ; Ross et al., 1998 ). Two studies used an overlap paradigm only ( McDowell, Myles-Worsley, Coon, Byerley, & Clementz, 1999 ; Petrovsky et al., 2008 ). Two of the studies that used a standard paradigm also used an overlap paradigms ( Curtis et al., 2001b ; McDowell & Clementz, 1997 ). Since the most data are available from the sixteen independent studies that used a standard paradigm, the discussion here will emphasize results from those studies. Below we address the following issues: (1) Is performance on the standard AS paradigm heritable, and on what measures? (2) Do RelSZ show a shift in mean and an increase in variance on the various measures of AS performance compared with nonpsychiatric controls? 3.1. Is performance heritable? Two studies have addressed the heritability of performance on the AS task. Both studies support the conclusion that genetic effects contribute to variability in error rate. No studies have examined the heritability of latency and gain, which have been used to measure performance less often than error rate. Malone and Iacono (2002) carried out a large twin study on performance on the standard AS task in a community-based epidemiological sample. They assessed AS errors in 207 11-year old and 203 17-year-old female monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and 126 11-year old and 102 17-year-old dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. The proportions of variance in error rate attributable to genetic and shared and specific environmental effects were estimated by fitting biometric models to the observed data. Variance in error rate attributable to additive genes was 57% in both age groups combined, despite a significant effect of age on error rate (effect size for age effect: 0.81). In both age cohorts of twins, the intra-class correlations (ICC) were statistically significant (11-year old MZ: ICC = 0.54; 11-year old DZ: ICC = 0.29; 17-year old MZ: ICC = 0.62; 17-year old DZ: ICC = 0.31), reflecting substantial phenotypic similarity within both types of twin pairs. Degree of resemblance was significantly higher in MZ twins than in DZ twins, consistent with genetic involvement in performance. The proportion of the variance accounted for by non-shared environment was 43% for both age groups combined. Shared environment did not contribute to phenotypic similarity. Of note, Malone and Iacono commented on the magnitude of individual differences in performance: “... standard deviations in the two [age] cohorts were at least as great as the magnitude of the difference in mean error rate between the groups.” (p. 670). The results recently reported by Greenwood et al.(2007) for the overlap AS paradigm are largely consistent with those of Malone and Iacono (2002) . They obtained an estimated heritability of 0.42 ( SE : 0.08; 95% confidence interval: 0.27?0.57) for error rate in a sample of 525 members of schizophrenia pedigrees. The authors noted that shared environment could have impacted the heritability estimates, but the Malone and Iacono results suggest that such an effect would not be substantial. The results of these two studies provide consistent evidence that a sizeable proportion of the variance in error rate on the standard and overlap AS paradigms is heritable. 1 These data supporting moderate levels of heritability are consistent with other findings showing significant but modest within-family correlations in performance ( Brownstein et al., 2003 ; Crawford et al., 1998 ; Curtis et al., 2001a ; McDowell & Clementz, 1997 ), although not all studies have reported significant intra-familial association ( Ettinger et al., 2004 ; MacCabe et al., 2005 ). The key question is what heritable familial resemblance has to do with a schizophrenia genotype (see ( Brownstein et al., 2003 ) for a more extensive discussion of this distinction). The heritability estimates for AS error rate described above, like heritability estimates for schizophrenia, do not necessarily imply that the mode of inheritance involves a major gene. A polygenic trait, for example, can have high heritability. 3.2. Do relatives of schizophrenia patients show the shift in mean performance and increase in variance compared with nonpsychiatric controls that would be expected from a genetic model involving co-familial transmission? 3.2.1. Error rate scores The error rate measure of AS performance was used in every study of RelSZ. Table 2 presents means, standard deviations and effect sizes (ES) for the sixteen independent studies that used the standard paradigm. Five studies reported that RelSZ made statistically significantly more errors on the AS task than NC did ( Clementz et al., 1994 ; Curtis et al., 2001a ; Karoumi et al., 2001 ; Katsanis et al., 1997 ; McDowell & Clementz, 1997 ). Effect sizes in these studies ranged from 0.50?0.78 for Cohen's d and from 0.635?1.03 for Glass’ delta. Eleven studies reported that RelSZ did not make significantly more errors than NC did ( Boudet et al., 2005 ; Brownstein et al., 2003 ; Crawford et al., 1998 ; de Wilde et al., 2008 ; Ettinger et al., 2004 , 2006 ; Louchart-de la Chapelle et al., 2005 ; MacCabe et al., 2005 ; Price et al., 2005 ; Thaker et al., 1996 , 2000 ). Effect sizes in these eleven studies ranged from ?0.13 to 0.60 for Cohen's d and 0.10 to 0.80 for Glass’ delta. In three of these studies the difference between groups was at the trend level for statistical significance: P < .08, ES: 0.60/0.80 ( Ettinger et al., 2004 ); P < .074, ES: 0.28/0.30 ( Price et al., 2005 ); P < .08, ES: 0.49/0.55 ( de Wilde et al., 2008 ). In three other studies the difference between RelSZ and NC was in the wrong direction, resulting in negative effect sizes. The design of some family studies has been predicated on the rationale that multiplex families, which are thought to have an increased genetic loading for schizophrenia, would be expected to show a higher rate of deviance in performance on a putative endophenotype than simplex families. Comparisons of simplex and multiplex families have been inconsistent. Two studies of multiplex families that used a standard AS paradigm reported either small or negative effect sizes ( Crawford et al., 1998 ; MacCabe et al., 2005 ). One of those studies included both simplex and multiplex families ( MacCabe et al., 2005 ). Error rate effect sizes were larger in simplex families than in multiplex families. The effect sizes for multiplex families were the most strongly negative (?.046/?0.41) to date and the effect sizes for simplex families were weakly positive (0.15/0.14). Another study of multiplex families showed a small effect size for the error rate score ( Crawford et al., 1998 ). In contrast, a study that used the overlap paradigm found that two samples of multiplex families had substantially larger (2.5?3 times larger) effect sizes than was found in a sample of simplex families. Far-overlap targets maximized separation of the groups ( McDowell et al., 1999 ). Another way to examine the effect of genetic loading is to compare the performance of most-likely gene carrier (MLC) parents and least-likely gene carrier (LLC) parents. Using the gap AS paradigm, Ross et al.(1998) compared small samples of most-likely gene carrier (MLC) parents of schizophrenics with least-likely gene carrier (LLC) parents. MLC parents, but not LLC parents, made significantly more errors than controls. Using an overlap paradigm, Petrovsky et al. (2008) reported that both the small group of MLC parents and the LLC parents had significantly higher error rates than controls. The data are thus mixed as to whether clinically unaffected members of multiplex families or individuals at greater genetic risk by virtue of a family history of psychosis have an increased probability of making more errors on the AS task. It is useful to point out that the discussion above has focused on the probability of deviance on the AS task given genetic loading, not on the probability of schizophrenia-related illness given AS deviance. It is possible that particular features of the AS paradigm are critical for eliciting group differences. For example, the far-overlap condition or the gap condition may reveal an effect of genetic loading that is not apparent with the standard paradigm. It is important to note, however, that the expectation of higher recurrence of poor AS performance in multiplex families would hold only if the same gene that increases liability for the endophenotype also increases risk for schizophrenia in those families. If the same gene that contributes to AS performance does not contribute to susceptibility for schizophrenia, for example, there would be no reason to expect multiplex families to differ from simplex families. Relevant in this regard, suggestive evidence of linkage to a marker on 22q11?12 has been reported for a composite phenotype consisting of performance on the far-overlap task and P50 sensory gating in multiplex families ( Myles-Worsley et al., 1999 ). COMT is located in this region. Variation in the valine158 methionine genotype was not significantly associated with AS error rate in one population sample ( Stefanis et al., 2004 ) but was related to performance in another sample of patients and controls ( Haraldsson et al., 2008 ) and to BOLD response ( Ettinger et al., 2008 ). As Table 2 shows, effect sizes for a difference between RelSZ and NC are quite variable and cover a very broad range. The mean for Cohen's d is 0.34 ( SD : 0.29) (95% confidence interval: 0.2?0.49) and the median is 0.36. The mean for Glass’ delta is 0.43 ( SD : 0.39) (95% confidence interval: 0.24?0.63) and the median is 0.39. The mean for r is 0.16 ( SD : 0.14) (95% confidence interval: 0.10?0.23) and the median is 0.17. One sample t-tests on the effect size values were all statistically significant (Cohen's d : t (15) = 4.7, P = .0003; r : t(15) = 4.8, P = .0003; Glass’ delta: t (15) = 4.4, P = .0005), indicating that the mean values for each measure of effect size are significantly greater than 0, although on average, the magnitude of the departure of the estimated effect size from 0 is relatively small and corresponds to a modest effect size using Cohen's criteria ( Cohen, 1988 ). We calculated whether the effect sizes were consistent with values drawn from a single distribution using heterogeneity analysis ( Rosenthal & Rubin, 1982 ). The results showed statistically significant heterogeneity (?215 = 27.99, P = .022), indicating that the effect sizes are not consistent with a single mean. The average effect size may thus not be a meaningful indicator of the magnitude of the difference in mean error rate between RelSZ and NC. The width of the confidence intervals, which is inversely related to the number of studies, also reflects uncertainty about the estimated mean effect size. Consistent with this interpretation, the coefficient of variation for the error rate effect sizes is 85.3%, indicating that the standard deviation of the effect sizes is almost as large as the mean effect size. The actual mean effect size may thus be smaller or larger than the average of these effect sizes. The average of these effect sizes may also be an overestimate because of publication bias favoring positive findings. Factors that may contribute to this heterogeneity are discussed below. Table 3 presents the variance ratios for the fifteen standard paradigm studies that provided means and standard deviations. Under the null hypothesis of equal variance, the variance ratio is distributed as F and the mean value of F = 1.0. The variances of the error scores of RelSZ were significantly larger than those of controls ( t (14) = 1.87, P = .04 one sided; Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, S = 33, P = .03, one-sided). On average, RelSZ had a variance that was 32% larger than that of NC. The 90% confidence interval ranges from 0.016 to 0.544, indicating that the mean variance ratio could be as low as 1.02 (indicating a 2% increase in variance) or as high as 1.72 (indicating a 72% increase in variance) in RelSZ relative to controls. A 32% mean increase in variance corresponds to a 15% mean increase in standard deviation. The reason(s) for this variability in effect size and variance ratio are uncertain, but are essential for clarifying the value of the AS task in genetic studies. We did not try to identify those factors that contribute to the heterogeneity of effect sizes. In a previous meta-analysis on the nine published family studies at that time ( Levy et al., 2004a ), the one factor that was consistent with the variability in effect size was the symmetry/asymmetry of the inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to RelSZ and NC. Studies that obtained large effect sizes used asymmetric exclusion criteria in that more restrictive inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied to controls than to RelSZ. Effect sizes were significantly smaller in studies that applied comparable inclusion/exclusion criteria to both groups. In contrast, neither differences in number of trials nor number of target eccentricities contributed significantly to variability in effect size. Although the results of that meta-analysis indicated that symmetrical/asymmetrical inclusion/exclusion criteria may be sufficient to explain variability in effect size when studies are considered as a group, data from individual studies suggest that asymmetrical inclusion/exclusion criteria may not be necessary for obtaining large effect sizes. In two studies whose inclusion/exclusion criteria were asymmetrical, RelSZ performed significantly worse than NC independent of co-morbid psychopathology even when more equivalent inclusion/exclusion criteria were subsequently applied to the two groups ( Calkins, Curtis, Iacono, & Grove, 2004 ; Curtis et al., 2001a ; Katsanis et al., 1997 ). Taken together, the results for error rate support three general conclusions regarding the standard AS paradigm. First, as discussed in the previous section, heritability contributes to variability in performance. Second, the estimated mean effect size for a difference between RelSZ and NC is modest and the coefficient of variation is large. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity in effect size. Third, on average, RelSZ show a small increase in variance, but the confidence interval is very broad and may reflect the heterogeneity in effect sizes. These results do not provide strong support for the inference that error rate on the standard AS paradigm would be a strong indicator of gene carrier status in RelSZ or would increase the power of linkage analysis of a multidimensional phenotype. 3.2.2. Latency Latency of correct AS is the next most widely used measure of performance. Table 4 presents means, standard deviations and effect sizes for the fourteen independent studies that used the standard paradigm. Three studies reported significantly increased AS latency in all or a subset of RelSZ ( Ettinger et al., 2006 ; Thaker et al., 1996 , 2000 ). In one report RelSZ without schizophrenia spectrum personality symptoms (SSPS) accounted for the difference in latency between RelSZ and NC ( Thaker et al., 1996 ); in another report from the same group, only SSPS RelSZ had significantly increased latency ( Thaker et al., 2000 ) (see also section below on effects of schizotypal symptoms). Effect sizes in these three studies ranged from 0 to 0.67 ( Thaker et al., 1996 ), 0.2 to 1.6 ( Thaker et al., 2000 ), and 0.95 to 1.03 ( Ettinger et al., 2006 ), respectively (see Table 1 ). Eleven studies did not find significant differences in latency between RelSZ and NC ( Boudet et al., 2005 ; Brownstein et al., 2003 ; Crawford et al., 1998 ; Curtis et al., 2001a ; de Wilde et al., 2008 ; Ettinger et al., 2004 ; Karoumi et al., 2001 ; Katsanis et al., 1997 ; Lou-chart-de la Chapelle et al., 2005 ; MacCabe et al., 2005 ; McDowell & Clementz, 1997 ). Effect sizes ranged from ?0.08 to 0.81 for Cohen's d and from ?0.10 to 0.98 for Glass’ delta. As Table 4 shows, effect sizes for a difference in latency between RelSZ and NC are quite variable and cover a very broad range, as was the case for the error rate score. The mean for Cohen's d is 0.33 ( SD : 0.30) (95% confidence interval: 0.17?0.50) and the median is 0.36. The mean for Glass’ delta is 0.37 ( SD : 0.35) (95% confidence interval: 0.18?0.55) and the median is 0.36). The mean for r is .16 ( SD : 0.14) (95% confidence interval: 0.08?0.24) and the median is 0.17. One sample t -tests on the effect size values were all statistically significant (Cohen's d : t (13) = 4.1, P = .0012; r : t(13) = 4.2, P = .001; Glass’ delta: t (13) = 4.0, P = .002), indicating that the mean values for each measure of effect size are significantly greater than 0, although as with error rate, on average, the magnitude of the departure of the estimated mean effect size from 0 is relatively small and corresponds to a small effect size using Cohen's criteria ( Cohen, 1988 ). The results of the heterogeneity analysis show a trend toward significant heterogeneity (?213 = 20.99, P = .07), indicating that the effect sizes may not be consistent with a single mean. The mean effect size thus may not be interpretable as a reflection of the magnitude of the difference in average latency between RelSZ and NC. The coefficient of variation for the latency effect sizes is 90.9%, which is consistent with evidence in favor of heterogeneity. As with the error rate score, the actual mean effect size for latency may be smaller or larger than the average of these effect sizes. It is not possible to rule out the possibility that the mean of these effect sizes may be an overestimate because of publication bias favoring positive findings. The heterogeneity analysis did not reach statistical significance, but the result does not provide strong evidence of homogeneity of effect sizes for latency. Table 5 presents the variance ratios for the thirteen standard AS paradigm studies that provided means and standard deviations. The variances of the latency scores of RelSZ were not significantly larger than those of controls (Signed Rank S = 10.5, P = .25 one-sided). These data do not support a consistently moderate-large difference in AS latency or an increase in variance between RelSZ and nonpsychiatric controls, although there could be a small difference in mean latency. 3.2.3. Gain Fewer studies have examined AS gain, or the accuracy of AS to the mirror image location, than the other two measures of performance. Table 6 presents means, standard deviations and effect sizes for the six independent studies that used the standard paradigm. Three studies reported significantly reduced gain in RelSZ or SibSZ compared with NC ( Ettinger et al.,2004 , 2006 ; Karoumi et al., 2001 ), with effect sizes ranging from 0.68 to 1.0. One study reported significantly increased gain in RelSZ ( de Wilde et al., 2008 ) with an effect size of 0.58/0.73. Two studies reported no significant group difference ( Crawford et al., 1998 ; McDowell & Clementz, 1997 ) and effect sizes of ?0.06 and 0.26/0.28, respectively. As Table 6 shows, effect sizes for a difference in gain between RelSZ and NC are quite variable and cover a very broad range. The mean for Cohen's d is 0.54 ( SD : 0.38) (95% confidence interval: 0.23?0.85) and the median is 0.63. The mean for Glass’ delta is 0.57 ( SD : 0.39) (95% confidence interval: 0.25?0.89) and the median is 0.71. The mean for r is .25 ( SD : 0.17) (95% confidence interval: 0.11?0.39) and the median is 0.30. One sample t -tests on the effect size values were all statistically significant (Cohen's d : t (5) = 3.47 P = .002; r: t(5) = 3.6, P = .02; Glass’ delta: t (5) = 3.57, P = .02), indicating that the mean values for each measure of effect size are significantly greater than 0, although as with error rate and latency, on average the magnitude of the departure of the estimated mean effect size from 0 for gain is relatively small and corresponds to a medium effect size using Cohen's criteria ( Cohen, 1988 ). The results of the heterogeneity analysis show a trend toward significant heterogeneity (?25 = 9.66, P = .09), indicating that the effect sizes may not be consistent with a single mean. The mean effect size may not be interpretable as a reflection of the magnitude of the difference in average gain between RelSZ and NC. Another reflection of the heterogeneity in effect size for gain is the large coefficient of variation, 68.4%, a result that does not provide strong evidence of homogeneity of effect sizes for gain. Indeed, the confidence intervals are broadest for this variable, reflecting uncertainty about the mean effect size for these six studies. Table 7 presents the variance ratios for the six standard paradigm studies that provided means and standard deviations. The variances of the gain scores of RelSZ were not significantly different from those of controls (Signed Rank S = 9.5, P = .34, one-sided). These data may support a moderate difference in mean AS gain between RelSZ and nonpsychiatric controls but do not support an increase in variance in RelSZ. In light of the small number of studies that used gain as a dependent measure, the results for this variable, in particular, should be interpreted cautiously. Three aspects of the results on gain are worth noting. First, the effect sizes for reduced gain (hypometria, see glossary) were arger for SibSZ and for discordant MZ co-twins compared with NC than for SZ patients compared with NC in both Ettinger et al. studies ( Ettinger et al., 2004 , 2006 ) (2004—SibSZ vs NC: 0.68/0.69; SZ vs NC: 0.44/0.58; 2006—co-twins vs NC: 1.0/1.01; SZ twins vs NC: 0.62/0.72). Similarly, de Wilde et al. (2008) reported a larger effect size for increased gain (hypermetria, see glossary) in the comparison of SibSZ with NC, 0.58/0.73, than in the comparison of SZ and NC, 0.24/0.29. Moreover, the effect size for hypermetria in SibSZ compared with SZ, 0.71/0.70, was larger than the effect size for the comparison of patients or siblings with NC. Larger effects in siblings than in patients would not be expected for a co-familial trait that would serve as a useful endophenotype. Also casting doubt on the usefulness of the gain measure as a measure of co-familiality, the intra-class correlation for familial resemblance was 0.08 ( de Wilde et al., 2008 ). Second, some studies report near perfect AS accuracy in controls. Controls in the Ettinger et al. sibling study ( Ettinger et al., 2004 ) had a mean AS gain of 0.996 to two target locations (±15°). The Ettinger et al. twin study ( Ettinger et al., 2006 ) reported a mean gain in controls of 1.0 to four target locations (±6°, 12°). Karoumi et al also reported near perfect AS accuracy in controls (0.98) for six target locations (±5°, 15°, 25°) ( Karoumi et al., 2001 ). These are remarkable levels of precision to non-visible targets. Third, several studies reported that controls showed better accuracy in making antisaccades—in the absence of a visual target—than for visually guided saccades. The mean gain for pro-saccades in controls was 0.94 in the Ettinger et al. sibling study ( Ettinger et al., 2004 ) and 0.96 in the Ettinger et al. twin study ( Ettinger et al., 2006 ), both of which were lower than the mean gains for antisaccades in the same groups (see above). Mean accuracy of pro-saccades and AS in controls were essentially equivalent in the Karoumi et al. study ( Karoumi et al., 2001 ). The estimated effect sizes for pairs of measures of performance are graphed in Figs. 1 - 3 . None of the correlations was statistically significant, although the maximum number of studies considered here was 14. The modest positive estimated correlation between latency and gain ( Fig. 3a ; r = .39, P = .44) is driven by one outlier value; the estimated correlation obtained between effect sizes for these two variables is modestly negative when the outlier value is removed ( Fig. 3b ; r = .43, P = .47).  3.1. Is performance heritable? Two studies have addressed the heritability of performance on the AS task. Both studies support the conclusion that genetic effects contribute to variability in error rate. No studies have examined the heritability of latency and gain, which have been used to measure performance less often than error rate. Malone and Iacono (2002) carried out a large twin study on performance on the standard AS task in a community-based epidemiological sample. They assessed AS errors in 207 11-year old and 203 17-year-old female monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and 126 11-year old and 102 17-year-old dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. The proportions of variance in error rate attributable to genetic and shared and specific environmental effects were estimated by fitting biometric models to the observed data. Variance in error rate attributable to additive genes was 57% in both age groups combined, despite a significant effect of age on error rate (effect size for age effect: 0.81). In both age cohorts of twins, the intra-class correlations (ICC) were statistically significant (11-year old MZ: ICC = 0.54; 11-year old DZ: ICC = 0.29; 17-year old MZ: ICC = 0.62; 17-year old DZ: ICC = 0.31), reflecting substantial phenotypic similarity within both types of twin pairs. Degree of resemblance was significantly higher in MZ twins than in DZ twins, consistent with genetic involvement in performance. The proportion of the variance accounted for by non-shared environment was 43% for both age groups combined. Shared environment did not contribute to phenotypic similarity. Of note, Malone and Iacono commented on the magnitude of individual differences in performance: “... standard deviations in the two [age] cohorts were at least as great as the magnitude of the difference in mean error rate between the groups.” (p. 670). The results recently reported by Greenwood et al.(2007) for the overlap AS paradigm are largely consistent with those of Malone and Iacono (2002) . They obtained an estimated heritability of 0.42 ( SE : 0.08; 95% confidence interval: 0.27?0.57) for error rate in a sample of 525 members of schizophrenia pedigrees. The authors noted that shared environment could have impacted the heritability estimates, but the Malone and Iacono results suggest that such an effect would not be substantial. The results of these two studies provide consistent evidence that a sizeable proportion of the variance in error rate on the standard and overlap AS paradigms is heritable. 1 These data supporting moderate levels of heritability are consistent with other findings showing significant but modest within-family correlations in performance ( Brownstein et al., 2003 ; Crawford et al., 1998 ; Curtis et al., 2001a ; McDowell & Clementz, 1997 ), although not all studies have reported significant intra-familial association ( Ettinger et al., 2004 ; MacCabe et al., 2005 ). The key question is what heritable familial resemblance has to do with a schizophrenia genotype (see ( Brownstein et al., 2003 ) for a more extensive discussion of this distinction). The heritability estimates for AS error rate described above, like heritability estimates for schizophrenia, do not necessarily imply that the mode of inheritance involves a major gene. A polygenic trait, for example, can have high heritability.  3.2. Do relatives of schizophrenia patients show the shift in mean performance and increase in variance compared with nonpsychiatric controls that would be expected from a genetic model involving co-familial transmission? 3.2.1. Error rate scores The error rate measure of AS performance was used in every study of RelSZ. Table 2 presents means, standard deviations and effect sizes (ES) for the sixteen independent studies that used the standard paradigm. Five studies reported that RelSZ made statistically significantly more errors on the AS task than NC did ( Clementz et al., 1994 ; Curtis et al., 2001a ; Karoumi et al., 2001 ; Katsanis et al., 1997 ; McDowell & Clementz, 1997 ). Effect sizes in these studies ranged from 0.50?0.78 for Cohen's d and from 0.635?1.03 for Glass’ delta. Eleven studies reported that RelSZ did not make significantly more errors than NC did ( Boudet et al., 2005 ; Brownstein et al., 2003 ; Crawford et al., 1998 ; de Wilde et al., 2008 ; Ettinger et al., 2004 , 2006 ; Louchart-de la Chapelle et al., 2005 ; MacCabe et al., 2005 ; Price et al., 2005 ; Thaker et al., 1996 , 2000 ). Effect sizes in these eleven studies ranged from ?0.13 to 0.60 for Cohen's d and 0.10 to 0.80 for Glass’ delta. In three of these studies the difference between groups was at the trend level for statistical significance: P < .08, ES: 0.60/0.80 ( Ettinger et al., 2004 ); P < .074, ES: 0.28/0.30 ( Price et al., 2005 ); P < .08, ES: 0.49/0.55 ( de Wilde et al., 2008 ). In three other studies the difference between RelSZ and NC was in the wrong direction, resulting in negative effect sizes. The design of some family studies has been predicated on the rationale that multiplex families, which are thought to have an increased genetic loading for schizophrenia, would be expected to show a higher rate of deviance in performance on a putative endophenotype than simplex families. Comparisons of simplex and multiplex families have been inconsistent. Two studies of multiplex families that used a standard AS paradigm reported either small or negative effect sizes ( Crawford et al., 1998 ; MacCabe et al., 2005 ). One of those studies included both simplex and multiplex families ( MacCabe et al., 2005 ). Error rate effect sizes were larger in simplex families than in multiplex families. The effect sizes for multiplex families were the most strongly negative (?.046/?0.41) to date and the effect sizes for simplex families were weakly positive (0.15/0.14). Another study of multiplex families showed a small effect size for the error rate score ( Crawford et al., 1998 ). In contrast, a study that used the overlap paradigm found that two samples of multiplex families had substantially larger (2.5?3 times larger) effect sizes than was found in a sample of simplex families. Far-overlap targets maximized separation of the groups ( McDowell et al., 1999 ). Another way to examine the effect of genetic loading is to compare the performance of most-likely gene carrier (MLC) parents and least-likely gene carrier (LLC) parents. Using the gap AS paradigm, Ross et al.(1998) compared small samples of most-likely gene carrier (MLC) parents of schizophrenics with least-likely gene carrier (LLC) parents. MLC parents, but not LLC parents, made significantly more errors than controls. Using an overlap paradigm, Petrovsky et al. (2008) reported that both the small group of MLC parents and the LLC parents had significantly higher error rates than controls. The data are thus mixed as to whether clinically unaffected members of multiplex families or individuals at greater genetic risk by virtue of a family history of psychosis have an increased probability of making more errors on the AS task. It is useful to point out that the discussion above has focused on the probability of deviance on the AS task given genetic loading, not on the probability of schizophrenia-related illness given AS deviance. It is possible that particular features of the AS paradigm are critical for eliciting group differences. For example, the far-overlap condition or the gap condition may reveal an effect of genetic loading that is not apparent with the standard paradigm. It is important to note, however, that the expectation of higher recurrence of poor AS performance in multiplex families would hold only if the same gene that increases liability for the endophenotype also increases risk for schizophrenia in those families. If the same gene that contributes to AS performance does not contribute to susceptibility for schizophrenia, for example, there would be no reason to expect multiplex families to differ from simplex families. Relevant in this regard, suggestive evidence of linkage to a marker on 22q11?12 has been reported for a composite phenotype consisting of performance on the far-overlap task and P50 sensory gating in multiplex families ( Myles-Worsley et al., 1999 ). COMT is located in this region. Variation in the valine158 methionine genotype was not significantly associated with AS error rate in one population sample ( Stefanis et al., 2004 ) but was related to performance in another sample of patients and controls ( Haraldsson et al., 2008 ) and to BOLD response ( Ettinger et al., 2008 ). As Table 2 shows, effect sizes for a difference between RelSZ and NC are quite variable and cover a very broad range. The mean for Cohen's d is 0.34 ( SD : 0.29) (95% confidence interval: 0.2?0.49) and the median is 0.36. The mean for Glass’ delta is 0.43 ( SD : 0.39) (95% confidence interval: 0.24?0.63) and the median is 0.39. The mean for r is 0.16 ( SD : 0.14) (95% confidence interval: 0.10?0.23) and the median is 0.17. One sample t-tests on the effect size values were all statistically significant (Cohen's d : t (15) = 4.7, P = .0003; r : t(15) = 4.8, P = .0003; Glass’ delta: t (15) = 4.4, P = .0005), indicating that the mean values for each measure of effect size are significantly greater than 0, although on average, the magnitude of the departure of the estimated effect size from 0 is relatively small and corresponds to a modest effect size using Cohen's criteria ( Cohen, 1988 ). We calculated whether the effect sizes were consistent with values drawn from a single distribution using heterogeneity analysis ( Rosenthal & Rubin, 1982 ). The results showed statistically significant heterogeneity (?215 = 27.99, P = .022), indicating that the effect sizes are not consistent with a single mean. The average effect size may thus not be a meaningful indicator of the magnitude of the difference in mean error rate between RelSZ and NC. The width of the confidence intervals, which is inversely related to the number of studies, also reflects uncertainty about the estimated mean effect size. Consistent with this interpretation, the coefficient of variation for the error rate effect sizes is 85.3%, indicating that the standard deviation of the effect sizes is almost as large as the mean effect size. The actual mean effect size may thus be smaller or larger than the average of these effect sizes. The average of these effect sizes may also be an overestimate because of publication bias favoring positive findings. Factors that may contribute to this heterogeneity are discussed below. Table 3 presents the variance ratios for the fifteen standard paradigm studies that provided means and standard deviations. Under the null hypothesis of equal variance, the variance ratio is distributed as F and the mean value of F = 1.0. The variances of the error scores of RelSZ were significantly larger than those of controls ( t (14) = 1.87, P = .04 one sided; Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, S = 33, P = .03, one-sided). On average, RelSZ had a variance that was 32% larger than that of NC. The 90% confidence interval ranges from 0.016 to 0.544, indicating that the mean variance ratio could be as low as 1.02 (indicating a 2% increase in variance) or as high as 1.72 (indicating a 72% increase in variance) in RelSZ relative to controls. A 32% mean increase in variance corresponds to a 15% mean increase in standard deviation. The reason(s) for this variability in effect size and variance ratio are uncertain, but are essential for clarifying the value of the AS task in genetic studies. We did not try to identify those factors that contribute to the heterogeneity of effect sizes. In a previous meta-analysis on the nine published family studies at that time ( Levy et al., 2004a ), the one factor that was consistent with the variability in effect size was the symmetry/asymmetry of the inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to RelSZ and NC. Studies that obtained large effect sizes used asymmetric exclusion criteria in that more restrictive inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied to controls than to RelSZ. Effect sizes were significantly smaller in studies that applied comparable inclusion/exclusion criteria to both groups. In contrast, neither differences in number of trials nor number of target eccentricities contributed significantly to variability in effect size. Although the results of that meta-analysis indicated that symmetrical/asymmetrical inclusion/exclusion criteria may be sufficient to explain variability in effect size when studies are considered as a group, data from individual studies suggest that asymmetrical inclusion/exclusion criteria may not be necessary for obtaining large effect sizes. In two studies whose inclusion/exclusion criteria were asymmetrical, RelSZ performed significantly worse than NC independent of co-morbid psychopathology even when more equivalent inclusion/exclusion criteria were subsequently applied to the two groups ( Calkins, Curtis, Iacono, & Grove, 2004 ; Curtis et al., 2001a ; Katsanis et al., 1997 ). Taken together, the results for error rate support three general conclusions regarding the standard AS paradigm. First, as discussed in the previous section, heritability contributes to variability in performance. Second, the estimated mean effect size for a difference between RelSZ and NC is modest and the coefficient of variation is large. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity in effect size. Third, on average, RelSZ show a small increase in variance, but the confidence interval is very broad and may reflect the heterogeneity in effect sizes. These results do not provide strong support for the inference that error rate on the standard AS paradigm would be a strong indicator of gene carrier status in RelSZ or would increase the power of linkage analysis of a multidimensional phenotype. 3.2.2. Latency Latency of correct AS is the next most widely used measure of performance. Table 4 presents means, standard deviations and effect sizes for the fourteen independent studies that used the standard paradigm. Three studies reported significantly increased AS latency in all or a subset of RelSZ ( Ettinger et al., 2006 ; Thaker et al., 1996 , 2000 ). In one report RelSZ without schizophrenia spectrum personality symptoms (SSPS) accounted for the difference in latency between RelSZ and NC ( Thaker et al., 1996 ); in another report from the same group, only SSPS RelSZ had significantly increased latency ( Thaker et al., 2000 ) (see also section below on effects of schizotypal symptoms). Effect sizes in these three studies ranged from 0 to 0.67 ( Thaker et al., 1996 ), 0.2 to 1.6 ( Thaker et al., 2000 ), and 0.95 to 1.03 ( Ettinger et al., 2006 ), respectively (see Table 1 ). Eleven studies did not find significant differences in latency between RelSZ and NC ( Boudet et al., 2005 ; Brownstein et al., 2003 ; Crawford et al., 1998 ; Curtis et al., 2001a ; de Wilde et al., 2008 ; Ettinger et al., 2004 ; Karoumi et al., 2001 ; Katsanis et al., 1997 ; Lou-chart-de la Chapelle et al., 2005 ; MacCabe et al., 2005 ; McDowell & Clementz, 1997 ). Effect sizes ranged from ?0.08 to 0.81 for Cohen's d and from ?0.10 to 0.98 for Glass’ delta. As Table 4 shows, effect sizes for a difference in latency between RelSZ and NC are quite variable and cover a very broad range, as was the case for the error rate score. The mean for Cohen's d is 0.33 ( SD : 0.30) (95% confidence interval: 0.17?0.50) and the median is 0.36. The mean for Glass’ delta is 0.37 ( SD : 0.35) (95% confidence interval: 0.18?0.55) and the median is 0.36). The mean for r is .16 ( SD : 0.14) (95% confidence interval: 0.08?0.24) and the median is 0.17. One sample t -tests on the effect size values were all statistically significant (Cohen's d : t (13) = 4.1, P = .0012; r : t(13) = 4.2, P = .001; Glass’ delta: t (13) = 4.0, P = .002), indicating that the mean values for each measure of effect size are significantly greater than 0, although as with error rate, on average, the magnitude of the departure of the estimated mean effect size from 0 is relatively small and corresponds to a small effect size using Cohen's criteria ( Cohen, 1988 ). The results of the heterogeneity analysis show a trend toward significant heterogeneity (?213 = 20.99, P = .07), indicating that the effect sizes may not be consistent with a single mean. The mean effect size thus may not be interpretable as a reflection of the magnitude of the difference in average latency between RelSZ and NC. The coefficient of variation for the latency effect sizes is 90.9%, which is consistent with evidence in favor of heterogeneity. As with the error rate score, the actual mean effect size for latency may be smaller or larger than the average of these effect sizes. It is not possible to rule out the possibility that the mean of these effect sizes may be an overestimate because of publication bias favoring positive findings. The heterogeneity analysis did not reach statistical significance, but the result does not provide strong evidence of homogeneity of effect sizes for latency. Table 5 presents the variance ratios for the thirteen standard AS paradigm studies that provided means and standard deviations. The variances of the latency scores of RelSZ were not significantly larger than those of controls (Signed Rank S = 10.5, P = .25 one-sided). These data do not support a consistently moderate-large difference in AS latency or an increase in variance between RelSZ and nonpsychiatric controls, although there could be a small difference in mean latency. 3.2.3. Gain Fewer studies have examined AS gain, or the accuracy of AS to the mirror image location, than the other two measures of performance. Table 6 presents means, standard deviations and effect sizes for the six independent studies that used the standard paradigm. Three studies reported significantly reduced gain in RelSZ or SibSZ compared with NC ( Ettinger et al.,2004 , 2006 ; Karoumi et al., 2001 ), with effect sizes ranging from 0.68 to 1.0. One study reported significantly increased gain in RelSZ ( de Wilde et al., 2008 ) with an effect size of 0.58/0.73. Two studies reported no significant group difference ( Crawford et al., 1998 ; McDowell & Clementz, 1997 ) and effect sizes of ?0.06 and 0.26/0.28, respectively. As Table 6 shows, effect sizes for a difference in gain between RelSZ and NC are quite variable and cover a very broad range. The mean for Cohen's d is 0.54 ( SD : 0.38) (95% confidence interval: 0.23?0.85) and the median is 0.63. The mean for Glass’ delta is 0.57 ( SD : 0.39) (95% confidence interval: 0.25?0.89) and the median is 0.71. The mean for r is .25 ( SD : 0.17) (95% confidence interval: 0.11?0.39) and the median is 0.30. One sample t -tests on the effect size values were all statistically significant (Cohen's d : t (5) = 3.47 P = .002; r: t(5) = 3.6, P = .02; Glass’ delta: t (5) = 3.57, P = .02), indicating that the mean values for each measure of effect size are significantly greater than 0, although as with error rate and latency, on average the magnitude of the departure of the estimated mean effect size from 0 for gain is relatively small and corresponds to a medium effect size using Cohen's criteria ( Cohen, 1988 ). The results of the heterogeneity analysis show a trend toward significant heterogeneity (?25 = 9.66, P = .09), indicating that the effect sizes may not be consistent with a single mean. The mean effect size may not be interpretable as a reflection of the magnitude of the difference in average gain between RelSZ and NC. Another reflection of the heterogeneity in effect size for gain is the large coefficient of variation, 68.4%, a result that does not provide strong evidence of homogeneity of effect sizes for gain. Indeed, the confidence intervals are broadest for this variable, reflecting uncertainty about the mean effect size for these six studies. Table 7 presents the variance ratios for the six standard paradigm studies that provided means and standard deviations. The variances of the gain scores of RelSZ were not significantly different from those of controls (Signed Rank S = 9.5, P = .34, one-sided). These data may support a moderate difference in mean AS gain between RelSZ and nonpsychiatric controls but do not support an increase in variance in RelSZ. In light of the small number of studies that used gain as a dependent measure, the results for this variable, in particular, should be interpreted cautiously. Three aspects of the results on gain are worth noting. First, the effect sizes for reduced gain (hypometria, see glossary) were arger for SibSZ and for discordant MZ co-twins compared with NC than for SZ patients compared with NC in both Ettinger et al. studies ( Ettinger et al., 2004 , 2006 ) (2004—SibSZ vs NC: 0.68/0.69; SZ vs NC: 0.44/0.58; 2006—co-twins vs NC: 1.0/1.01; SZ twins vs NC: 0.62/0.72). Similarly, de Wilde et al. (2008) reported a larger effect size for increased gain (hypermetria, see glossary) in the comparison of SibSZ with NC, 0.58/0.73, than in the comparison of SZ and NC, 0.24/0.29. Moreover, the effect size for hypermetria in SibSZ compared with SZ, 0.71/0.70, was larger than the effect size for the comparison of patients or siblings with NC. Larger effects in siblings than in patients would not be expected for a co-familial trait that would serve as a useful endophenotype. Also casting doubt on the usefulness of the gain measure as a measure of co-familiality, the intra-class correlation for familial resemblance was 0.08 ( de Wilde et al., 2008 ). Second, some studies report near perfect AS accuracy in controls. Controls in the Ettinger et al. sibling study ( Ettinger et al., 2004 ) had a mean AS gain of 0.996 to two target locations (±15°). The Ettinger et al. twin study ( Ettinger et al., 2006 ) reported a mean gain in controls of 1.0 to four target locations (±6°, 12°). Karoumi et al also reported near perfect AS accuracy in controls (0.98) for six target locations (±5°, 15°, 25°) ( Karoumi et al., 2001 ). These are remarkable levels of precision to non-visible targets. Third, several studies reported that controls showed better accuracy in making antisaccades—in the absence of a visual target—than for visually guided saccades. The mean gain for pro-saccades in controls was 0.94 in the Ettinger et al. sibling study ( Ettinger et al., 2004 ) and 0.96 in the Ettinger et al. twin study ( Ettinger et al., 2006 ), both of which were lower than the mean gains for antisaccades in the same groups (see above). Mean accuracy of pro-saccades and AS in controls were essentially equivalent in the Karoumi et al. study ( Karoumi et al., 2001 ). The estimated effect sizes for pairs of measures of performance are graphed in Figs. 1 - 3 . None of the correlations was statistically significant, although the maximum number of studies considered here was 14. The modest positive estimated correlation between latency and gain ( Fig. 3a ; r = .39, P = .44) is driven by one outlier value; the estimated correlation obtained between effect sizes for these two variables is modestly negative when the outlier value is removed ( Fig. 3b ; r = .43, P = .47).  3.2.1. Error rate scores The error rate measure of AS performance was used in every study of RelSZ. Table 2 presents means, standard deviations and effect sizes (ES) for the sixteen independent studies that used the standard paradigm. Five studies reported that RelSZ made statistically significantly more errors on the AS task than NC did ( Clementz et al., 1994 ; Curtis et al., 2001a ; Karoumi et al., 2001 ; Katsanis et al., 1997 ; McDowell & Clementz, 1997 ). Effect sizes in these studies ranged from 0.50?0.78 for Cohen's d and from 0.635?1.03 for Glass’ delta. Eleven studies reported that RelSZ did not make significantly more errors than NC did ( Boudet et al., 2005 ; Brownstein et al., 2003 ; Crawford et al., 1998 ; de Wilde et al., 2008 ; Ettinger et al., 2004 , 2006 ; Louchart-de la Chapelle et al., 2005 ; MacCabe et al., 2005 ; Price et al., 2005 ; Thaker et al., 1996 , 2000 ). Effect sizes in these eleven studies ranged from ?0.13 to 0.60 for Cohen's d and 0.10 to 0.80 for Glass’ delta. In three of these studies the difference between groups was at the trend level for statistical significance: P < .08, ES: 0.60/0.80 ( Ettinger et al., 2004 ); P < .074, ES: 0.28/0.30 ( Price et al., 2005 ); P < .08, ES: 0.49/0.55 ( de Wilde et al., 2008 ). In three other studies the difference between RelSZ and NC was in the wrong direction, resulting in negative effect sizes. The design of some family studies has been predicated on the rationale that multiplex families, which are thought to have an increased genetic loading for schizophrenia, would be expected to show a higher rate of deviance in performance on a putative endophenotype than simplex families.

Another study of multiplex families showed a small effect size for the error rate score ( Crawford et al., 1998 ). In contrast, a study that used the overlap paradigm found that two samples of multiplex families had substantially larger (2.5?3 times larger) effect sizes than was found in a sample of simplex families. Far-overlap targets maximized separation of the groups ( McDowell et al., 1999 ). Another way to examine the effect of genetic loading is to compare the performance of most-likely gene carrier (MLC) parents and least-likely gene carrier (LLC) parents. Using the gap AS paradigm, Ross et al.(1998) compared small samples of most-likely gene carrier (MLC) parents of schizophrenics with least-likely gene carrier (LLC) parents. MLC parents, but not LLC parents, made significantly more errors than controls. Using an overlap paradigm, Petrovsky et al. (2008) reported that both the small group of MLC parents and the LLC parents had significantly higher error rates than controls. The data are thus mixed as to whether clinically unaffected members of multiplex families or individuals at greater genetic risk by virtue of a family history of psychosis have an increased probability of making more errors on the AS task. It is useful to point out that the discussion above has focused on the probability of deviance on the AS task given genetic loading, not on the probability of schizophrenia-related illness given AS deviance. It is possible that particular features of the AS paradigm are critical for eliciting group differences. For example, the far-overlap condition or the gap condition may reveal an effect of genetic loading that is not apparent with the standard paradigm. It is important to note, however, that the expectation of higher recurrence of poor AS performance in multiplex families would hold only if the same gene that increases liability for the endophenotype also increases risk for schizophrenia in those families. If the same gene that contributes to AS performance does not contribute to susceptibility for schizophrenia, for example, there would be no reason to expect multiplex families to differ from simplex families. Relevant in this regard, suggestive evidence of linkage to a marker on 22q11?12 has been reported for a composite phenotype consisting of performance on the far-overlap task and P50 sensory gating in multiplex families ( Myles-Worsley et al., 1999 ). COMT is located in this region. Variation in the valine158 methionine genotype was not significantly associated with AS error rate in one population sample ( Stefanis et al., 2004 ) but was related to performance in another sample of patients and controls ( Haraldsson et al., 2008 ) and to BOLD response ( Ettinger et al., 2008 ). As Table 2 shows, effect sizes for a difference between RelSZ and NC are quite variable and cover a very broad range. The mean for Cohen's d is 0.34 ( SD : 0.29) (95% confidence interval: 0.2?0.49) and the median is 0.36. The mean for Glass’ delta is 0.43 ( SD : 0.39) (95% confidence interval: 0.24?0.63) and the median is 0.39. The mean for r is 0.16 ( SD : 0.14) (95% confidence interval: 0.10?0.23) and the median is 0.17. One sample t-tests on the effect size values were all statistically significant (Cohen's d : t (15) = 4.7, P = .0003; r : t(15) = 4.8, P = .0003; Glass’ delta: t (15) = 4.4, P = .0005), indicating that the mean values for each measure of effect size are significantly greater than 0, although on average, the magnitude of the departure of the estimated effect size from 0 is relatively small and corresponds to a modest effect size using Cohen's criteria ( Cohen, 1988 ). We calculated whether the effect sizes were consistent with values drawn from a single distribution using heterogeneity analysis ( Rosenthal & Rubin, 1982 ). The results showed statistically significant heterogeneity (?215 = 27.99, P = .022), indicating that the effect sizes are not consistent with a single mean. The average effect size may thus not be a meaningful indicator of the magnitude of the difference in mean error rate between RelSZ and NC. The width of the confidence intervals, which is inversely related to the number of studies, also reflects uncertainty about the estimated mean effect size. Consistent with this interpretation, the coefficient of variation for the error rate effect sizes is 85.3%, indicating that the standard deviation of the effect sizes is almost as large as the mean effect size. The actual mean effect size may thus be smaller or larger than the average of these effect sizes. The average of these effect sizes may also be an overestimate because of publication bias favoring positive findings. Factors that may contribute to this heterogeneity are discussed below. Table 3 presents the variance ratios for the fifteen standard paradigm studies that provided means and standard deviations. Under the null hypothesis of equal variance, the variance ratio is distributed as F and the mean value of F = 1.0. The variances of the error scores of RelSZ were significantly larger than those of controls ( t (14) = 1.87, P = .04 one sided; Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, S = 33, P = .03, one-sided). On average, RelSZ had a variance that was 32% larger than that of NC. The 90% confidence interval ranges from 0.016 to 0.544, indicating that the mean variance ratio could be as low as 1.02 (indicating a 2% increase in variance) or as high as 1.72 (indicating a 72% increase in variance) in RelSZ relative to controls. A 32% mean increase in variance corresponds to a 15% mean increase in standard deviation. The reason(s) for this variability in effect size and variance ratio are uncertain, but are essential for clarifying the value of the AS task in genetic studies. We did not try to identify those factors that contribute to the heterogeneity of effect sizes. In a previous meta-analysis on the nine published family studies at that time ( Levy et al., 2004a ), the one factor that was consistent with the variability in effect size was the symmetry/asymmetry of the inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to RelSZ and NC. Studies that obtained large effect sizes used asymmetric exclusion criteria in that more restrictive inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied to controls than to RelSZ. Effect sizes were significantly smaller in studies that applied comparable inclusion/exclusion criteria to both groups. In contrast, neither differences in number of trials nor number of target eccentricities contributed significantly to variability in effect size. Although the results of that meta-analysis indicated that symmetrical/asymmetrical inclusion/exclusion criteria may be sufficient to explain variability in effect size when studies are considered as a group, data from individual studies suggest that asymmetrical inclusion/exclusion criteria may not be necessary for obtaining large effect sizes. In two studies whose inclusion/exclusion criteria were asymmetrical, RelSZ performed significantly worse than NC independent of co-morbid psychopathology even when more equivalent inclusion/exclusion criteria were subsequently applied to the two groups ( Calkins, Curtis, Iacono, & Grove, 2004 ; Curtis et al., 2001a ; Katsanis et al., 1997 ). Taken together, the results for error rate support three general conclusions regarding the standard AS paradigm. First, as discussed in the previous section, heritability contributes to variability in performance. Second, the estimated mean effect size for a difference between RelSZ and NC is modest and the coefficient of variation is large. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity in effect size. Third, on average, RelSZ show a small increase in variance, but the confidence interval is very broad and may reflect the heterogeneity in effect sizes. These results do not provide strong support for the inference that error rate on the standard AS paradigm would be a strong indicator of gene carrier status in RelSZ or would increase the power of linkage analysis of a multidimensional phenotype.  3.2.2. Latency Latency of correct AS is the next most widely used measure of performance. Table 4 presents means, standard deviations and effect sizes for the fourteen independent studies that used the standard paradigm. Three studies reported significantly increased AS latency in all or a subset of RelSZ ( Ettinger et al., 2006 ; Thaker et al., 1996 , 2000 ). In one report RelSZ without schizophrenia spectrum personality symptoms (SSPS) accounted for the difference in latency between RelSZ and NC ( Thaker et al., 1996 ); in another report from the same group, only SSPS RelSZ had significantly increased latency ( Thaker et al., 2000 ) (see also section below on effects of schizotypal symptoms). Effect sizes in these three studies ranged from 0 to 0.67 ( Thaker et al., 1996 ), 0.2 to 1.6 ( Thaker et al., 2000 ), and 0.95 to 1.03 ( Ettinger et al., 2006 ), respectively (see Table 1 ). Eleven studies did not find significant differences in latency between RelSZ and NC ( Boudet et al., 2005 ; Brownstein et al., 2003 ; Crawford et al., 1998 ; Curtis et al., 2001a ; de Wilde et al., 2008 ; Ettinger et al., 2004 ; Karoumi et al., 2001 ; Katsanis et al., 1997 ; Lou-chart-de la Chapelle et al., 2005 ; MacCabe et al., 2005 ; McDowell & Clementz, 1997 ). Effect sizes ranged from ?0.08 to 0.81 for Cohen's d and from ?0.10 to 0.98 for Glass’ delta. As Table 4 shows, effect sizes for a difference in latency between RelSZ and NC are quite variable and cover a very broad range, as was the case for the error rate score. The mean for Cohen's d is 0.33 ( SD : 0.30) (95% confidence interval: 0.17?0.50) and the median is 0.36. The mean for Glass’ delta is 0.37 ( SD : 0.35) (95% confidence interval: 0.18?0.55) and the median is 0.36). The mean for r is .16 ( SD : 0.14) (95% confidence interval: 0.08?0.24) and the median is 0.17. One sample t -tests on the effect size values were all statistically significant (Cohen's d : t (13) = 4.1, P = .0012; r : t(13) = 4.2, P = .001; Glass’ delta: t (13) = 4.0, P = .002), indicating that the mean values for each measure of effect size are significantly greater than 0, although as with error rate, on average, the magnitude of the departure of the estimated mean effect size from 0 is relatively small and corresponds to a small effect size using Cohen's criteria ( Cohen, 1988 ). The results of the heterogeneity analysis show a trend toward significant heterogeneity (?213 = 20.99, P = .07), indicating that the effect sizes may not be consistent with a single mean. The mean effect size thus may not be interpretable as a reflection of the magnitude of the difference in average latency between RelSZ and NC. The coefficient of variation for the latency effect sizes is 90.9%, which is consistent with evidence in favor of heterogeneity. As with the error rate score, the actual mean effect size for latency may be smaller or larger than the average of these effect sizes. It is not possible to rule out the possibility that the mean of these effect sizes may be an overestimate because of publication bias favoring positive findings. The heterogeneity analysis did not reach statistical significance, but the result does not provide strong evidence of homogeneity of effect sizes for latency. Table 5 presents the variance ratios for the thirteen standard AS paradigm studies that provided means and standard deviations. The variances of the latency scores of RelSZ were not significantly larger than those of controls (Signed Rank S = 10.5, P = .25 one-sided). These data do not support a consistently moderate-large difference in AS latency or an increase in variance between RelSZ and nonpsychiatric controls, although there could be a small difference in mean latency.  3.2.3. Gain Fewer studies have examined AS gain, or the accuracy of AS to the mirror image location, than the other two measures of performance. Table 6 presents means, standard deviations and effect sizes for the six independent studies that used the standard paradigm. Three studies reported significantly reduced gain in RelSZ or SibSZ compared with NC ( Ettinger et al.,2004 , 2006 ; Karoumi et al., 2001 ), with effect sizes ranging from 0.68 to 1.0. One study reported significantly increased gain in RelSZ ( de Wilde et al., 2008 ) with an effect size of 0.58/0.73. Two studies reported no significant group difference ( Crawford et al., 1998 ; McDowell & Clementz, 1997 ) and effect sizes of ?0.06 and 0.26/0.28, respectively. As Table 6 shows, effect sizes for a difference in gain between RelSZ and NC are quite variable and cover a very broad range. The mean for Cohen's d is 0.54 ( SD : 0.38) (95% confidence interval: 0.23?0.85) and the median is 0.63. The mean for Glass’ delta is 0.57 ( SD : 0.39) (95% confidence interval: 0.25?0.89) and the median is 0.71. The mean for r is .25 ( SD : 0.17) (95% confidence interval: 0.11?0.39) and the median is 0.30. One sample t -tests on the effect size values were all statistically significant (Cohen's d : t (5) = 3.47 P = .002; r: t(5) = 3.6, P = .02; Glass’ delta: t (5) = 3.57, P = .02), indicating that the mean values for each measure of effect size are significantly greater than 0, although as with error rate and latency, on average the magnitude of the departure of the estimated mean effect size from 0 for gain is relatively small and corresponds to a medium effect size using Cohen's criteria ( Cohen, 1988 ). The results of the heterogeneity analysis show a trend toward significant heterogeneity (?25 = 9.66, P = .09), indicating that the effect sizes may not be consistent with a single mean. The mean effect size may not be interpretable as a reflection of the magnitude of the difference in average gain between RelSZ and NC. Another reflection of the heterogeneity in effect size for gain is the large coefficient of variation, 68.4%, a result that does not provide strong evidence of homogeneity of effect sizes for gain. Indeed, the confidence intervals are broadest for this variable, reflecting uncertainty about the mean effect size for these six studies. Table 7 presents the variance ratios for the six standard paradigm studies that provided means and standard deviations. The variances of the gain scores of RelSZ were not significantly different from those of controls (Signed Rank S = 9.5, P = .34, one-sided). These data may support a moderate difference in mean AS gain between RelSZ and nonpsychiatric controls but do not support an increase in variance in RelSZ. In light of the small number of studies that used gain as a dependent measure, the results for this variable, in particular, should be interpreted cautiously. Three aspects of the results on gain are worth noting. First, the effect sizes for reduced gain (hypometria, see glossary) were arger for SibSZ and for discordant MZ co-twins compared with NC than for SZ patients compared with NC in both Ettinger et al. studies ( Ettinger et al., 2004 , 2006 ) (2004—SibSZ vs NC: 0.68/0.69; SZ vs NC: 0.44/0.58; 2006—co-twins vs NC: 1.0/1.01; SZ twins vs NC: 0.62/0.72). Similarly, de Wilde et al. (2008) reported a larger effect size for increased gain (hypermetria, see glossary) in the comparison of SibSZ with NC, 0.58/0.73, than in the comparison of SZ and NC, 0.24/0.29. Moreover, the effect size for hypermetria in SibSZ compared with SZ, 0.71/0.70, was larger than the effect size for the comparison of patients or siblings with NC. Larger effects in siblings than in patients would not be expected for a co-familial trait that would serve as a useful endophenotype. Also casting doubt on the usefulness of the gain measure as a measure of co-familiality, the intra-class correlation for familial resemblance was 0.08 ( de Wilde et al., 2008 ). Second, some studies report near perfect AS accuracy in controls. Controls in the Ettinger et al. sibling study ( Ettinger et al., 2004 ) had a mean AS gain of 0.996 to two target locations (±15°). The Ettinger et al. twin study ( Ettinger et al., 2006 ) reported a mean gain in controls of 1.0 to four target locations (±6°, 12°). Karoumi et al also reported near perfect AS accuracy in controls (0.98) for six target locations (±5°, 15°, 25°) ( Karoumi et al., 2001 ). These are remarkable levels of precision to non-visible targets. Third, several studies reported that controls showed better accuracy in making antisaccades—in the absence of a visual target—than for visually guided saccades. The mean gain for pro-saccades in controls was 0.94 in the Ettinger et al. sibling study ( Ettinger et al., 2004 ) and 0.96 in the Ettinger et al. twin study ( Ettinger et al., 2006 ), both of which were lower than the mean gains for antisaccades in the same groups (see above). Mean accuracy of pro-saccades and AS in controls were essentially equivalent in the Karoumi et al. study ( Karoumi et al., 2001 ). The estimated effect sizes for pairs of measures of performance are graphed in Figs. 1 - 3 . None of the correlations was statistically significant, although the maximum number of studies considered here was 14. The modest positive estimated correlation between latency and gain ( Fig. 3a ; r = .39, P = .44) is driven by one outlier value; the estimated correlation obtained between effect sizes for these two variables is modestly negative when the outlier value is removed ( Fig. 3b ; r = .43, P = .47).  4. Effects of schizotypal symptoms If schizotypal symptoms in RelSZ increase the probability of being a carrier for schizophrenia genes and poor performance on the AS task is an alternate expression of one or more of these genes, the probability of poor AS performance could be increased in RelSZ with schizotypal symptoms compared to those without schizotypal symptoms. Only two studies have dichotomized subjects in terms of the presence or absence of schizotypal symptoms (SSPS), although a number of samples in other studies included a few schizotypal RelSZ. Thaker et al. (1996) did not find a statistically significant difference in error rate between RelSZ with or without SSPS compared with community controls (with or without SSPS), but the effect size for the comparison of RelSZ with SSPS vs NC with SSPS (0.41/0.37) was substantially larger than the effect size for the comparison of RelSZ without SSPS vs NC without SSPS (0.02/0.02). A similar pattern was found for the error rate effect sizes in a larger subsequent study ( Thaker et al., 2000 ). RelSZ with SSPS had a larger effect size (0.68/0.75) than RelSZ without SSPS (0.15/0.17). Thus, both studies showed moderately large effect sizes for increased error rate in RelSZ with SSPS and very small effect sizes in RelSZ without SSPS. The results for latency show an inconsistent pattern across the two studies. In the first Thaker et al. ( Thaker et al., 1996 ) study, latency was significantly increased in all RelSZ compared with NC, although the ES were modest (0.38/0.39). However, the overall group difference was driven by the non-SSPS RelSZ group; the effect size for a difference between SSPS RelSZ and SSPS NC was 0, whereas the contrast between non -SSPS RelSZ and non-SSPS NC yielded an effect size of 0.66/0.67. In the later study ( Thaker et al., 2000 ), the pattern for latency paralleled the pattern observed for error rate in the same study, but the effect size was substantially larger. SSPS RelSZ were slower to initiate correct AS than SSPS NC (0.90/1.61), whereas the contrast between non-SSPS RelSZ and non-SSPS NC produced a small effect (0.21/0.19). Taken together, there seems to be some association between SSPS in RelSZ and poor performance on the AS task that is more strongly seen in slowed latency than in increased errors, but the results are not consistent. Although three of the discordant MZ co-twins in the Ettinger et al. (2006) sample and three RelSZ in the Crawford et al ( Crawford et al., 1998 ) sample were diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, the relation between performance and this diagnosis was not addressed in either study. In the Clementz et al. (1994) study, three RelSZ had schizotypal personality disorder and one had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The scatter plot in Fig. 3a and b of that paper makes clear that a schizophrenia spectrum disorder is not a necessary condition for poor performance even though one of these four RelSZ had an error score almost three times the standard deviation of the RelSZ group.  5. Conclusions For the standard AS task, the estimated effect size for each of the three measures of performance was significantly greater than 0. For each variable, however, the magnitude of the departure of the estimated effect size from 0 is relatively small. Each dependent measure shows a wide range of effect sizes and variance ratios as well as evidence of significant or near significant heterogeneity. The coefficients of variation for the three measures of performance were large (all >65%), reflecting unclarity about the magnitude of the actual effect sizes and (given the probability of publication bias favoring positive effect sizes) the representativeness of the average effect sizes as estimates of mean effect sizes. These data do not provide compelling support for a consistent shift in mean or variance in RelSZ relative to nonpsychiatric controls. Error rate on both the standard and far-overlap AS task shows moderate heritability. This combination of findings suggests that intra-familial resemblance on the AS task may well be influenced by genetic factors, but may not be related to schizophrenia susceptibility genes. Based on the current literature, it would be premature to conclude that any of the measures of performance on the standard AS task unambiguously or strongly meets the co-familiality criterion for an endophenotype. Thus, it is unlikely that performance on this task would increase power to detect linkage by improving detection of non-penetrant gene carriers. The principal support for meeting the co-familiality criterion must be derived independent of schizophrenia-related psychopathology in RelSZ. In order to demonstrate convincingly that RelSZ show both a shift in mean and an increase in variance relative to controls, symmetrically ascertained samples are essential. This is the only way to establish that increased errors identify that subset of non-penetrant gene carriers who would be classified as unaffected based on a clinical phenotype alone. It is also the only way to estimate the magnitude of the improvement in gene carrier detection associated with an elevated error rate. Since psychotic relatives are likely to perform poorly (see ( Curtis et al., 2001a ; MacCabe et al., 2005 )), their inclusion can be expected to increase the mean and variance of the RelSZ group. There is no reason not to test RelSZ who are psychotic or who have schizophrenia-related personality disorders on the AS task, but it is the performance of RelSZ who would be considered clinically unaffected that is most germane to fulfilling the co-familiality criterion. Fewer studies used the overlap and gap versions of the AS task than used the standard paradigm. The far-overlap AS task has been shown to yield the largest effects sizes in distinguishing RelSZ from NC. Whether this version of the AS task fulfills the co-familiality criterion for an endophenotype remains unclear. Data on the far overlap paradigm are available from only two studies of three samples, all from a single laboratory. A previous meta-analysis found significant heterogeneity for both the near-overlap and far-overlap paradigms ( Levy et al., 2004a ). We purposefully did not combine studies that used different AS paradigms for two reasons. First, heterogeneity of effect size is present within paradigm (for the standard task and for the overlap task; for the gap task, there are too few studies for a heterogeneity analysis to be meaningful) ( Levy et al., 2004a ). Second, observed effect sizes are correlated in most studies that used the overlap task due to non-independence of the control group. The reasons for the variability in effect size and variance ratio across studies are not clear. As mentioned above, the symmetry/asymmetry of inclusion criteria may be sufficient but not necessary to account for large effect sizes. A number of other aspects of experimental design may impact the magnitude of group differences. For example, the absence of mention of a blind in the diagnostic assessments, during data acquisition, and during data processing is conspicuous in most of this literature. In addition, a standard pro-saccade task is routinely administered before the AS task, which is equivalent to priming subjects to do exactly the opposite of what is required for correct performance on the AS task. Another unexplored potential source of variability is whether or not subjects received feedback about their performance by having a target appear at the correct response location at the end of each trial. Routine inclusion of scatter plots or histograms of data points would be one way to facilitate thorough and constructive evaluation of this literature.
