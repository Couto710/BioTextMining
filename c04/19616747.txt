Modeling Plan-Related Clinical Complications using Machine Learning Tools in a Multi-Plan IMRT Framework Purpose To predict organ-at-risk (OAR) complications as a function of dose-volume (DV) constraint settings without explicit plan computation in a multi-plan IMRT framework. Methods and Materials A large number of plans were generated by varying the dose-volume constraints (input features) on the OARs (multi-plan framework), and the dose-volume levels achieved by the OARs in the plans (plan properties) were modeled as a function of the imposed dose-volume constraint settings. OAR complications were then predicted for each of the plans by using the imposed dose-volume constraints alone ( features ) or in combination with modeled dose-volume levels ( plan properties ) as input to machine learning (ML) algorithms. These ML approaches were used to model two OAR complications following head-and-neck and prostate IMRT, xerostomia and Grade 2 rectal bleeding. Two-fold cross-validation was used for model verification and mean errors are reported. Results Errors for modeling the achieved dose-volume values as a function of constraint settings were 0-6%. In the head and neck case, the mean absolute prediction error of the saliva flow rate normalized to the pre-treatment saliva flow rate was 0.42% with a 95% confidence interval of [0.41%, 0.43%]. In the prostate case, an average prediction accuracy of 97.04% with a 95% confidence interval of [96.67%, 97.41%] was achieved for Grade 2 rectal bleeding complications. Conclusion ML can be used for predicting OAR complications during treatment planning allowing for alternative dose-volume constraint settings to be assessed within the planning framework.
