Shwachman Diamond Syndrome – a review of the clinical presentation, molecular pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment  CONCLUSIONS SDS is a rare autosomal recessive multi-system disorder with varying phenotypic presentation. The identification of the SBDS gene has greatly expanded diagnostic capabilities; however, mechanistic and biological studies defining SBDS gene function are needed to advance our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of marrow failure and leukemia. To date, studies have not shown any correlation between hematologic or skeletal phenotype and the SBDS genotype [ 30 , 76 ]. The complete clinical phenotype, natural history, and risk factors associated with the development of future complications such as aplastic anemia, MDS, or leukemia need to be elucidated in order to better determine the optimal timing of therapeutic intervention. Collaborative efforts are currently underway to develop a longitudinal data registry and tissue repository specifically for patients with SDS for clinical and scientific studies. Equally important will be the development of clinical trials addressing pertinent clinical challenges such as optimal HCT regimens. These new efforts will likely advance our ability to diagnose and better treat patients with SDS.  Tables Table 1 Recommended workup for patients with SDS Diagnostic Studies: ?Marrow Function ??Peripheral blood count with smear, MCV ??Reticulocyte count ??Bone marrow aspirate & biopsy: pathologic review and cytogenetics, iron stain ?Exocrine pancreatic function ??Trypsinogen (age < 3yr) or serum pancreatic isoamylase (age >3 yr) ??72 hour fecal fat measurement, fecal elastase ??+/? Endoscopic pancreatic stimulation testing ??Vitamin A, D, E, and K levels ?Genetic testing ?? SBDS mutation analysis Supportive Studies: ?Liver function ??ALT, AST, GGT, albumin, prealbumin, prothrombin time ?Immune Workup ??Immunoglobulin levels (IgA, IgG, IgM) ??T and B lymphocyte subset analysis ??Additional work up as clinically indicated ?Radiological workup ??Pancreatic imaging ??X-ray evaluation for skeletal abnormalities, in particular metaphyseal dysostosis or thorasic dystrophies ??Echocardiogram if clinically indicated Consultations: ?Hematology ?Gastroenterology ?Endocrinology ?Genetics ?Developmental assessment ?Dental evaluation Table 2 Summary of recent publications HCT for SDS Conditioning Regimen (n) Donor Source(n) Stem Cell Source (n) Median Age at HCT (yrs) Engraftment (n) GVHD Prophylaxis (n) +/?
