Controlled Induction of Spherical Aberration with Custom Soft Contact Lenses Background This study investigated the non-invasive induction of spherical aberration (SA) levels consistent with complication-free wavefront-guided (WFG) refractive surgery using custom WFG soft contact lenses and quantified the resulting impact on visual performance. Methods Twelve healthy individuals of typical military age (mean of 26.08, SD ± 1.92 years) meeting the inclusion criteria of emmetropia (< ±0.50DS and < ±0.50DC) as measured by subjective refraction served as subjects. Five plano lenses were manufactured to induce a range of SA typical of those encountered after refractive surgery. The measured SA values over a 6mm artificial pupil in these five lenses were ?0.224?m, 0.074?m, 0.214?m, 0.495?m and 0.621?m, respectively. For each subject, the level of total ocular aberration through 10 Zernike radial orders over a 6mm pupil was measured with a custom Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor while wearing each lens. Visual performance was evaluated using high contrast visual acuity (HCVA) measured through a 6mm artificial pupil. Results Custom WFG soft contact lenses can be manufactured to include the range of SA that occurs with complication-free refractive surgery (?0.20?m to +0.60?m) and produces a change in SA within a similar range when worn on the eye. High contrast visual performance with these lenses varied depending on the amount of SA in each lens. Visual performance worsened with greater amounts of positive or negative SA and a quadratic fit to the data peaked at +0.209?m. Conclusions Defined levels of SA can be manufactured and induced (non-invasively) with WFG soft contact lenses and their effect on logMAR high contrast visual performance can be measured. Results show that subjects’ best logMAR HCVA occurs with the presence of positive residual SA. When designing the actual test lens, the targeted change in aberration for each subject will likely be better achieved by first measuring the aberrations of a template lens on the eye and then compensating for unique subject dependent eye-lens interactions.  Introduction The major goal of refractive surgery is to reduce lower order aberration (LOA) terms (sphere, cylinder) without increasing higher-order aberration (HOA) terms (coma, spherical aberration (SA), etc). If this goal is achieved, a subject should maintain good visual performance without the need for optical correction. In state-of-the-art complication-free refractive surgery, it has been reported that approximately 20% of individuals experienced a reduction in HOA, while the majority experienced an increase. 1 The ability to reduce HOA post-surgically is often dependent on the pre-surgical optical state of the eye. This point is demonstrated by the observation that individuals with low levels of pre-operative higher-order wavefront error (HO-WFE) are more at risk of experiencing an increase in HO-WFE following wavefront-guided surgery than are eyes with high levels of pre-operative HO-WFE (which are more likely to have a decrease in HO-WFE). 2 ; 3 Further, a positive correlation has been demonstrated between the level of post-operative SA and pre-operative refractive error (i.e., the higher the attempted myopic correction, the more positive SA induced). 3 These factors suggest that eyes with high levels of myopia and low levels of HO-WFE pre-operatively may experience a greater change (induction) in post-surgical HO-WFE, specifically SA. Given that elevated levels of HOA, specifically SA, are an unintended consequence of refractive surgery, 1 their impact on post-surgical visual performance is important to understand. To date, simulation has been used to investigate the impact of discrete levels of individual aberration (including SA) on visual acuity. 4 – 7 The method of the simulation studies was to “blur” the printed target with the desired aberration(s) and ask an observer to perform a visual performance task with near-diffraction limited optics (subjects viewed the target best corrected (sphere and cylinder) through a 3mm artificial pupil). These studies demonstrated that 0.25?m of simulated SA over a 6mm pupil reduced high contrast logMAR acuity by 1 line. 4 The current study attempts to move closer to the actual scenario that would present following refractive surgery in a non-invasive manner by allowing both the component aberration under test (SA), and residual low and higher-order aberrations of the eye to participate in image degradation. Given that this experiment utilizes contact lenses to achieve this, aberrations that result from small lens movements and decentrations also participate in image degradation. The purpose of the study is to non-invasively evaluate the impact of the range of SA typically observed following refractive surgery on visual performance using custom wavefront-guided (WFG) soft contact lenses.  Methods Twelve healthy individuals of typical military age (mean of 26.08, SD ± 1.92 years) meeting the inclusion criteria of emmetropia (< ±0.50DS and < ±0.50DC) as measured by subjective refraction served as subjects.

Conclusions Defined levels of SA can be manufactured and induced (non-invasively) with WFG soft contact lenses and their effect on logMAR high contrast visual performance can be measured. Results show that subjects’ best logMAR HCVA occurs with the presence of positive residual SA. When designing the actual test lens, the targeted change in aberration for each subject will likely be better achieved by first measuring the aberrations of a template lens on the eye and then compensating for unique subject dependent eye-lens interactions.  Results Subjects All 12 subjects achieved at least 20/20?1 undilated Snellen monocular entrance acuity with no correction (refer to Table 1 ). Table 1 shows HO RMS mean and standard deviation (SD) for the study subjects (0.278?m ± 1.32). Habitual HO RMS levels over 6mm were within 2 SD of the population mean (0.294?m ± 0.190?m 2SD) for all subjects except subject 11. Subject 11 had above normal higher-order aberrations. In Table 1 the mean and SD are shown for SA (0.060?m ± 0.085). For all subjects, SA levels over 6mm were within 2SD of the population mean (0.116?m±0.250?m 2SD). The normative comparative database has been previously reported as part of the Texas Investigation of Normal and Cataract Optics (TINCO) dataset. 8 Lens Manufacture The 5 study contact lenses were designed to alter the level of SA experienced by an eye to levels that could result during complication-free refractive surgery. The designed level of SA and measured level of SA for each lens measured with the ClearWave (off of the eye) are plotted together in Figure 1 . Lens labels reflect the designed level of SA in the lens:M20 (?0.20?m), P00 (0.00?m), P20 (+0.20?m), P40 (+0.40?m) and P60 (+0.60?m). The total higher-order RMS and (SA RMS) measured in the lenses were 0.250um (0.224um), 0.112um (0.074um), 0.232um (0.214um), 0.507um (0.495um) and 0.639um (0.621um) respectively. The lenses represented discrete steps over the range of SA under study. On-eye change in spherical aberration Figure 2 plots the on-eye change in SA (measured SA with lens wear – measured SA of the eye with no lens) vs. measured SA of the eye with no lens for each subject. In total, this graph contains 60 data points (12 subjects*5 lenses per subject). Each subject is coded with a different symbol. Notice that each of the 5 symbols for each subject varies in induced change in SA over the desired range of SA consistent with complication-free refractive surgery. Also notice that the desired change in SA varies slightly between individuals indicating that there are unique subject-dependent interactions between the eye and the WFG soft lens. The 5 study lenses were designed, as a group, to induce a mean change of +0.20?m ((?0.20 + 0.00 + 0.20 + 0.40 + 0.60)/5). These lenses were tested on all twelve subjects. The mean of the lenses measured on the ClearWave profiler was +0.236?m. Figure 3 illustrates the observed variation in mean change in SA induced by the 5 lenses. The designed (DSN) and measured (MSR) mean of the contact lenses is plotted with the mean change in SA for each subject wearing the lenses. All subjects have a mean change in SA lower than the +0.236?m measured in the lens set. This denotes a shift toward more negative levels of SA for the lenses on the eye than is measured in the ClearWave profiler. The mean change in SA experienced across subjects for all lens conditions was 0.076?m ±0.050?m. The fact that the mean SA measured in the test lenses is > 2SD from the mean change in SA measured with the lenses on the eye implies that other factors influenced the level of SA experienced by the eye. High contrast logMAR visual acuity was recorded for each subject under the 6 test conditions (no lens and the 5 test lenses); these data are plotted in Figure 4 against measured SA of the eye/lens system. The average level of SA experienced habitually by the 12 study eyes is +0.060?m. A model was fit to the data, which predicted 45% of the variance and was statistically significant (p<0.0001). To account for subject independence, the data were recalculated based on 12 subjects and 10 degrees of freedom and remained statistically significant (p<0.02). The data were fitted again for each subject independently and a similar trend was noticed. Reduced visual performance occurred with elevated levels of both positive and negative SA. This model predicted the best logMAR VA to occur at SA levels of +0.209?m. Previous reports have stated that variability in the high contrast logMAR VA task is ±2 letters. 5 A range encompassing ±2 letters was calculated between ?0.002?m and 0.420?m (dashed lines). This range includes the average habitual SA of the sample.

Specifically, the study demonstrated that SA levels consistent with complication-free refractive surgery can be induced non-invasively in the eye with wavefront-guided soft contact lenses. Visual performance results show that, as expected, high contrast logMAR VA decreases with large excursions from a subject’s habitual level of SA and that the best logMAR VA was achieved with the induction of some positive SA. The study also highlighted many of the challenges associated with utilizing wavefront-guided lenses to alter aberration, such as lens movement and lens centration. While the challenges of stabilization exist, the method may prove useful in gaining a better understanding of a wide range of higher-order aberration structures in real world situations. The ability to evaluate visual performance under non-laboratory conditions (habitual or real world conditions) is a major advantage of this contact lens technique over adaptive optics systems or simulation experiments. Custom WFG soft contact lenses can be manufactured to include the range of SA that occurs in complication-free refractive surgery (?0.20?m to +0.60?m). 2 When worn on the eye, these lenses produce a change in SA within a similar range; however, the lenses on the eye tended to have less positive SA than the designed SA lens when measured off of the eye. This warrants further study but is not the major finding being reported. HCVA varied depending on the amount of SA in each lens. HCVA tended to worsen with greater amounts positive or negative SA and peaked when the model SA was +0.209?m. The finding that visual systems prefers some positive SA is consistent with the argument of Beiko, where in the presence of other HOAs, targeting for a post-operative mean residual SA of approximately +0.10 ?m resulted in better contrast sensitivity. 12 Although HCVA is utilized clinically when testing visual performance, as done here, low contrast logMAR VA is a more sensitive metric. 13 The variation in HCVA for any given level of SA was larger than expected. To date, studies designed to isolate the major factors causing the larger than expected variation in HCVA have not been conducted. The major factor likely to cause larger than expected variation in HCVA is contact lens decentration and movement during acuity measurements, which would induce unknown aberrations at the time of the acuity measurement (aberrations were not measured at the same time as the acuity measurement). Lens decentration and movement were not specifically measured in this study, however because the fitting relationship in Figure 4 is highly significant (p-value <0.0001) the variation of this data can likely be attributed to other (non-SA) aberrations associated with decentration and movement. Other less likely factors include misalignment of the trial frame with low order correction and use of objective vs. subjective refraction. In future studies we will measure aberrations of the eye/lens system simultaneously with visual performance testing, and measure contact lens decentration, and movement. In this study, we demonstrated that defined levels of SA can be manufactured and induced (non-invasively) with WFG soft contact lenses and their effect on logMAR high contrast visual performance can be measured. The results showed that subjects’ best logMAR HCVA occurred with the presence of some positive residual SA. While true of this population of subjects under these test conditions, we do not conclude that some SA, or more specifically that 0.209?m, is the most desirable level of SA. For example, if two linear functions were fitted to the data, the crossing point may be closer to the mean SA of this population prior to lens wear. This would support the notion that an individual prefers their normal aberrations. Similarly if given time to adapt to no spherical aberration, a patient may prefer no spherical aberration. When designing the actual test lens, the targeted change in aberration for each subject will likely be better achieved by first measuring the aberrations of a template lens on the eye and then compensating for unique subject dependent eye-lens interactions.

Reduced visual performance occurred with elevated levels of both positive and negative SA. This model predicted the best logMAR VA to occur at SA levels of +0.209?m. A range encompassing ?2 letters was calculated between ?0.002?m and 0.420?m (dashed lines). This range includes the average habitual SA of the sample.

All subjects were free of ocular and systemic disease and had SA levels within ±2 SD of the population mean for a 6 mm pupil ( C 4 0 = 0.116 ? m ± 0.125 ? m ). 8 Eleven of the subjects were female, and one was male. If both eyes met the criteria, the test eye was identified as the eye with better entrance acuity. All aberration measurements were recorded with a custom-built Shack Hartmann wavefront sensor described previously. 9 The subjects enrolled that had no history of soft contact lens use were adapted to lens wear with Cooper Vision (Berkeley, CA) ClearSight 1Day soft contact lenses for a duration of one week prior to data collection. The research was conducted in the Visual Optics Institute at the College of Optometry, University of Houston adhering to the Tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and informed consent were obtained prior to data collection. Custom contact lens manufacture The average flat auto-keratometry reading for the twelve subjects was 43.28 ± 1.31.A baseline plano custom soft contact lens (Lb) with an 8.70mm posterior base curve radius was designed for this study. The lens central thickness was 0.21mm and overall diameter was 14.5mm. The lens was implemented in BENZ G5X-ES (hioxifilcon A) contact lens material (Benz, Sarasota, FL). Lens Lb served as a basis for five additional test contact lenses whose optics were designed to induce a prescribed level of SA of C 4 0 = ? 0.20 ? m , 0.00?m, +0.20?m, +0.40?m and +0.60?m over a central 6mm aperture. These levels cover the range of SA induced by complication-free refractive surgery. 2 The lenses were implemented on a DAC International (Carpinteria, CA) 2X-ALM ophthalmic lens lathe. One set of test lenses was used on all twelve subjects. The center of the SA pattern was the geometric center of the optical zone of the contact lens. Custom lens preparation Lenses were delivered to Metro Optics (Austin, TX) for hydration, bottling and sterilization. The lenses were then delivered to Adventure in Colors (Golden, CO) where a black occluder tint was placed on the lens periphery, defining a central 6mm clear optical zone. Once returned to the Visual Optics Institute the optical properties of the lenses were measured using the Wavefront Sciences (Albuquerque, NM) ClearWave optical profiler 10 to specify the Zernike optical aberration structure through the 10th radial order. Optical aberration test procedures Subjects were dilated with 1.0% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine to a diameter of at least 7mm. Reinstallation of both drops was performed as needed during experimentation. Twenty minutes after installation of the dilating agent a randomized test lens was placed on the eye. A total of six optical conditions were tested: 5 defined by the test lenses and 1 defined with no lens on the eye. The following steps were followed for each condition: 1) the randomized test lens was placed on the eye and the subject was allowed to adapt to wearing the lens for 5 minutes prior to any measurements (this step was omitted when testing the no lens condition) 2) The level of total ocular aberration was measured 3 times with the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor and each spot pattern analyzed over a diameter of 6mm. Between each measurement, the subject was asked to blink and was then realigned prior to the following measurement. For each lens condition, 3rd through 10th order Zernike coefficients were calculated and averaged for a 6mm pupil. Reduction of low order aberration Since the goal of the study was to examine the impact of residual SA typical of complication-free refractive surgery outcomes, the investigators corrected the low order aberration with an objectively defined spectacle refraction (as defined by the wavefront sensor) worn by the subject during visual performance testing. The objective sphero-cylindrical refraction at a 14mm vertex distance was calculated from the wavefront error for each measurement and an average Rx was calculated to the nearest 1/8th diopter and placed in a trial frame worn by the subject. This was done to minimize residual low order aberrations in the eye-lens system. During the no lens condition, an artificial 6mm pupil was placed in the back cell of the trial frame. Visual performance test procedures HCVA was measured 3 times using 3 unique letter charts. The HCVA test used 0.10 logMAR steps between lines and included 5 letters per line, giving each letter a value of 0.02 logMAR. All visual performance measures were recorded monocularly with the fellow eye occluded. HCVA tests were administered under photopic conditions (130cd/m2) using charts that were generated with a custom Matlab program (The Mathworks, Natick, MA) and digitally displayed on an LCD monitor (Dell 1708) using PsychToolbox. 11 The computer program presented one row of letters at a time to the observer. In this case, the dimension with the largest extent was the horizontal dimension. The visual angle of the horizontal dimension of the largest row of letters tested was 3.91 degrees, which was well within the full field of illumination, as modeled by the Gullstrand exact schematic eye. Final logMAR acuity was calculated giving credit to each letter read correctly up to the 5th letter missed. All visual performance tasks were performed at 4.54m, with a correcting lens of +0.25D added to the distance correction to place the charts at optical infinity. The average of the 3 test chart readings defined the visual performance under each test condition. Summary The steps listed above were performed on the eye while wearing each of the 5 test lenses and with no lens, for a total of 6 conditions. This resulted in 18 wavefront measurements (6 conditions * 3 measurements per condition), and 18 HCVA measurements (6 conditions * 3 measurements per condition) for each subject. All measurements for a given subject were completed in 1 visit.
