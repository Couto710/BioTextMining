Safety of an IV Formulation of Carbamazepine An intravenous formulation of carbamazepine (CBZ) was administered to 113 (60 male; 53 female) persons with epilepsy aged 19 to 87 years. Subjects received 100 mg of study drug as replacement for 100 mg of their usual morning dose of CBZ. There were no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate suggesting that this formulation can be developed as replacement therapy for persons unable to take oral CBZ.
