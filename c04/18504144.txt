Vitamin D and pancreatic cancer Sun exposure has been associated with lower death rates for pancreatic cancer in ecological studies. Skin exposure to solar ultra-violet B radiation induces cutaneous production of precursors to 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D (D) and is considered the primary contributor to vitamin D status in most populations. Pancreatic islet and duct cells express 25-(OH) D3-1?-hydroxylase that generates the biologically active 1,25-dihydroxy(OH)2 D form. Thus, 25(OH)D concentrations could affect pancreatic function and possibly pancreatic cancer etiology. Serum 25-(OH)D is the major circulating vitamin D metabolite and is considered the best indicator of vitamin D status as determined by the sun and diet. Although recent prospective epidemiologic studies of higher predicted vitamin D status score and vitamin D intake and pancreatic cancer risk suggest protective associations, a nested case-control study showed a significant 3-fold increased risk for pancreatic cancer with higher vitamin D status. Limitations of these studies include the former do not measure vitamin D status on pancreatic cancer cases and the later was conducted in a male smoker population. More research is needed, particularly examination of pre-diagnostic vitamin D status and risk of pancreatic cancer, prior to conclusions for vitamin D’s potential role in the etiology of this highly fatal cancer.  Conclusions The results from epidemiologic studies, including ecologic, predicted 25(OH) vitamin D status score, vitamin D intake, and biochemical measured vitamin D status, are conflicting and the respective limitations of each study should be considered. As the effect of vitamin D on molecular mechanisms underlying pancreatic carcinogenesis are not well understood, in addition to examination of potential anticarcinogenic effects of high vitamin D and vitamin D analogues, alternative and biologically plausible mechanisms related to how lower vitamin D levels might influence tumor growth should also be considered and investigated in basic research studies. At present no conclusions can be made regarding vitamin D’s potential role(s) in the etiology of pancreatic cancer. More epidemiologic research is needed, particularly prospective studies that relate pre-diagnostic vitamin D status to pancreatic cancer in cohorts that include women and non-smokers.
