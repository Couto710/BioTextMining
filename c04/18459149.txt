Dysregulation of Apoptotic Signaling in Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Opportunities Apoptosis is a tightly regulated cell suicide program that plays an essential role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by eliminating unnecessary or harmful cells. Defects in this native defense mechanism promote malignant transformation and frequently confer chemoresistance to transformed cells. Indeed, the evasion of apoptosis has been recognized as a hallmark of cancer. Given that multiple mechanisms function at many levels to orchestrate the regulation of apoptosis, a multitude of opportunities for apoptotic dysregulation are present within the intricate signaling network of cell. Several of the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells are protected from apoptosis have been elucidated. These advances have facilitated the development of novel apoptosis-inducing agents that have demonstrated single-agent activity against various types of cancers cells and/or sensitized resistant cancer cells to conventional cytotoxic therapies. Herein, we will highlight several of the central modes of apoptotic dysregulation found in cancer. We will also discuss several therapeutic strategies that aim to reestablish the apoptotic response, and thereby eradicate cancer cells, including those that demonstrate resistance to traditional therapies.  CONCLUSION The essential role of apoptosis in preventing tumor-promoting processes, particularly aberrant cellular proliferation and the accumulation of genetic defects, has clearly been confirmed since the prospect that apoptosis serves as a barrier to cancer was initially suggested by Kerr et al. [1972] . The evasion of apoptosis is now well recognized as a prominent hallmark of cancer, and tremendous progress has been made in defining the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells acquire resistance to apoptosis. In view of the significance of apoptosis suppression in mediating the development and progression of cancer, targeting the molecular defects responsible for the abrogation of apoptosis has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for treating an array of cancers. While classical cancer therapies act on normal cells as well as cancer cells, thus causing adverse side effects, and fail to elicit a therapeutic response in apoptotic-deficient cells, therapeutic agents that restore apoptotic signaling are expected to selectively target and eradicate cancer cells dependent on apoptosis-suppressing oncogenic mutations for survival and to sensitize cancer cells to other anti-neoplastic agents. Indeed, the therapeutic potential of this approach has been realized, as highlighted by the clinical success of several agents directed against various identified mechanisms that act, at least in part, to protect cancer cells from apoptosis. Despite the achievements thus far, the therapeutic strategy of reinstating the apoptotic response remains an enormous challenge. This approach must be tailored to specific subsets of cancers, as various cancers cells bear distinct sets of defects. Thus, considering the high grade of heterogeneity between tumors, even of the same type, exploiting the induction of apoptosis as a means to eliminate cancer cells requires extensive efforts toward the further investigation of the specific modes of apoptotic dysregulation. Nevertheless, the therapeutic limitations of existing drugs, often attributable to apoptosis resistance, and the encouraging results of preclinical and clinical studies clearly validate the continued search for agents aimed at reestablishing the apoptotic response.
