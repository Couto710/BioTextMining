Comment on “The influence of age at exposure to PCBs on birth outcomes”  Concern 3: The “maternal age at exposure” effect appears to be an artifact of methodological issues Table 1 shows a comparison of the estimates from the birth weight model in Sweeney and Symanski’s (2007) Table 4 compared to the same model when evaluated in our dataset. All of the parameter estimates are in the same direction, and despite our differences in sample size and cohort inclusions, the parameter estimates are remarkably similar. The coefficient for maternal age at exposure ?10 years, which we will refer to as “maternal age at enrollment” is 232 g in Sweeney and Symanski (2007) and 200 g in our dataset. What poses a concern in these models is the inclusion of three related variables: 1) maternal age at enrollment, 2) interval between mother’s blood draw (at enrollment) and date of infant’s birth, and 3) maternal age at infant’s birth. When modeled together these three variables are highly collinear. As supporting evidence, we present the results from two sets of analyses: 1) collinearity diagnostics and 2) an examination of the association between maternal age at enrollment and birth weight with and without adjustments for the other two variables. The results follow: 1) Collinearity diagnostics Any one of these three variables can be determined from the other two variables. Maternal age at the time of infant’s birth is the sum of the maternal age at enrollment and the interval between enrollment and infant date of birth (maternal age at enrollment + interval ? maternal age at infant’s birth). At an intuitive level, these variables appear collinear. Most of the participants in the cohort had their initial blood test for PBB collected when they were enrolled into the study. The “interval” which is defined as the “interval between date of blood test and date of birth” is actually the time from entry into the study to infant date of birth. Thus, if you add interval to maternal age at enrollment, you will approximate maternal age at the time of infant’s birth. Because one of the variables, maternal age at enrollment, was categorized in the Sweeney and Symanski’s (2007) models, while interval and maternal age at infant’s birth were continuous, the magnitude of the collinearity was diminished. To more formally assess the collinearity between these variables, we evaluated the two–way correlations among these three variables. The Sperman’s rank correlation coefficient between maternal age at enrollment and maternal age at infant’s birth was 0.33. The highest correlation coefficient was between maternal age at enrollment (treated continuously) and interval (Rs = ?0.74, p<0.0001). When maternal age at enrollment was treated categorically, the correlation coefficient between maternal age at enrollment and interval was slightly smaller (Rs = ?0.64, p<0.0001), but still notable. We also computed eigenvalues and condition indices using a Principal Components Analysis to determine which variables were collinear ( Belsley, 2005 ). We built several models to determine the extent of collinearity under different conditions ( Table 2 ). We used a cut–off for condition indices > 30 and variance decomposition proportions (VDP) > 0.5 to indicate multicollinearity. In Model 2.1, besides the intercept, the predictors with the highest VDPs were maternal age at infant’s birth and maternal age at enrollment (the ?10 years category). The VDP in the 11–16 years maternal age at enrollment category and the interval were only slightly below 0.5. When several insignificant variables were removed (Model 2.2), the multicollinearity remained. In model 2.3, when maternal age at enrollment was considered as a continuous variable instead of a categorical variable, all three variables in question had very high VDPs. Only when one of the three variables was eliminated does the collinearity disappear (Models 2.4 and 2.5). 2) Modeling the association of maternal age at enrollment with birth weight (unadjusted and adjusted) Table 3 gives the results of unadjusted and adjusted models of maternal age at enrollment (both continuous and categorical), maternal age at infant’s birth and interval between date of blood test and infant’s birth with the outcome birth weight. The first model in Table 3 suggests an increase in birth weight with older maternal age at enrollment when categorized similarly to the maternal age at enrollment variable in Sweeney and Symanski’s (2007) models. However, the direction of the association for maternal age at enrollment is opposite to what is reported in Table 4 of Sweeney and Symanski (2007) . When maternal age at enrollment is modeled as a continuous variable, the direction of the association remains the same (Model 3.2). Adjusting maternal age at enrollment for interval (Model 3.3) or maternal age at infant’s birth (Model 3.4) alters the estimates slightly, but does not change the direction of the association. Thus, modeling maternal age at enrollment, by itself or adjusted for interval or maternal age at infant’s birth (but not both), indicates that younger age at enrollment is associated with lower birth weight. These results are quite different than Sweeney and Symanski’s (2007) conclusions. Finally, we included all three variables together in a model with birth weight as the outcome. In Model 3.5, when maternal age at enrollment was categorized, the results were similar and in the same direction as results presented in Sweeney and Symanski’s (2007) Table 4. Alternatively, in Model 3.6, when maternal age at enrollment was continuous, none of the three variables had significant associations with birth weight; possibly because of the multicollinearity that exists in the data. Including all three variables in our model (Model 3.5) causes the maternal age at enrollment estimate to change directions from what is seen when maternal age at enrollment is modeled by itself with birth weight (Models 3.1 and 3.2). Instead of a decrease in birth weight with younger maternal age at enrollment, when all three variables are in the model we see an increase in birth weight with younger maternal age at enrollment (Model 3.5), as was indicated by Sweeney and Symanski (2007) . Thus, it is only when maternal age at enrollment is a categorical variable and is adjusted for both maternal age at infant’s birth and for interval between enrollment and infant’s birth does the association change direction. A primary focus of both articles was to determine the effect of maternal serum PBB on infant’s birth weight. The suggestion of a non–monotonic relationship between maternal serum PBB and birth weight is consistent in both papers. Sweeney and Symanski (2007) found a significant quadratic PBB effect in their model in Table 3 ; however, their abstract describes only a linear relationship of 16 g heavier birth weight for every 10 ppb increase in PBB levels. When PBB levels were categorized, a similar positive association with birth weight is seen for the highly exposed. Sweeney and Symanski (2007) reported a 105 g higher birth weight when maternal PBB levels were ?14 ppb (Table 4, p = 0.0834) compared to the referent group (< 14 ppb). Our PBB estimate was in the same direction, although slightly attenuated for maternal PBB levels ?14 ppb (PBB estimate = 116 g, p = 0.1278, Givens et al., 2007 ). However, when we split PBB levels at the median value above the LOD, we found an inverse association with lower birth weight for maternal PBB levels > 3 ppb ( Table 2 , PBB estimate = ?99 g, p = 0.0484, Givens et al., 2007 ). The relationship between maternal serum PBB and infant’s birth weight is difficult to explain, given the change in direction for the PBB estimates when categorized at various levels. Hence, we can only conclude there was no dose-response relationship between maternal serum PBB levels and infant’s birth weight. In summary, we believe that the effect of “maternal age at exposure” reported in Sweeney and Symanski (2007) is an artifact of a collinearity problem between maternal age at exposure\enrollment, interval between enrollment and date of infant’s birth and maternal age at infant’s birth. In addition, the conclusion that maternal age at exposure is related to birth weight implies that there is an association of exposure with birth weight that is different for mothers exposed at different ages. This was not directly tested in the analyses presented in Sweeney and Symanski’s (2007) article. Finally, we note that maternal age at enrollment is not equivalent to maternal age at exposure to PBB.  1) Collinearity diagnostics Any one of these three variables can be determined from the other two variables.
