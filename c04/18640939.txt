Relationship Between ERCC1 Polymorphisms, Disease Progression, and Survival in the Gynecologic Oncology Group Phase III Trial of Intraperitoneal Versus Intravenous Cisplatin and Paclitaxel for Stage III Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Purpose We hypothesized that common polymorphisms in excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), involved in nucleotide excision repair of platinum-induced damage, would be associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in women with optimally resected, stage III epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel (C + P). Patients and Methods Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis was carried out by direct pyrosequencing at two sites (codon 118 and C8092A ) in ERCC1 in leukocyte DNA from women who participated in the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) phase III protocol-172 and were randomly assigned to intraperitoneal or intravenous C + P Results ERCC1 genotyping was performed in 233 of the 429 women who participated in GOG-172. The genotype distribution at codon 118 was 17% with C/C, 43% with C/T, and 40% with T/T, and the genotype distribution at C8092A was 56% with C/C, 37% with C/A, and 7% with A/A. Adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that the codon 118 polymorphism in ERCC1 was not significantly associated with disease progression or death. Women with the C8092A C/A or A/A genotypes compared with the C/C genotype had an increased risk of disease progression (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.94; P = .018) and death (HR = 1.50; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.09; P = .018). Median PFS and OS were 6 and 17 months shorter for women with the C8092A C/A or A/A genotypes versus the C/C genotype, respectively. Conclusion Although the ERCC1 codon 118 polymorphism does not seem to be associated with clinical outcome, the C8092A polymorphism was an independent predictor of PFS and OS in women with optimally resected EOC.  INTRODUCTION Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of death in the United States in women diagnosed with gynecologic malignancies, with 21,650 new cases and 15,520 women estimated to die of ovarian cancer in 2008. 1 The standard treatment for EOC includes staging laparotomy with cytoreduction followed by platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy. 2 – 14 Despite impressive initial response rates, 5-year survival for this patient population remains approximately 30% to 50%. 1 , 8 – 11 Patients with either platinum-refractory EOC who do not respond to initial cytotoxic chemotherapy or platinumresistant EOC who develop recurrent disease within 6 months of completion of adjuvant therapy have the worst prognosis. Identification of patients who are less responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy would permit treatment decisions tailored to the individual and allow for selection of novel agents and drug combinations that would hopefully have increased efficacy, reduced adverse effects, better quality of life, and long-term benefit. Therefore, any biologic or genetic markers that could identify women at risk for platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant disease would have immediate clinical utility. Platinum agents induce formation of interstrand and intrastrand DNA cross-links. These adducts are recognized and repaired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Cells that have a robust nucleotide excision repair mechanism have a greater likelihood of repairing DNA lesions and surviving a platinum challenge. Thus, functional variants in genes involved in the DNA repair pathway may be important determinants of platinum response in women with platinum-sensitive, -resistant, or -refractory EOC. One of the genes in this pathway, excision repair cross-complementation group 1 ( ERCC1 ), seems to play a significant role in platinum-DNA adduct repair. Expression levels of ERCC1 correlate strongly with response to platinum-based therapy. 15 – 18 Increased ERCC1 mRNA levels in ovarian tumors resulted in decreased platinum sensitivity, 19 and downregulation of ERCC1 expression, with antisense ERCC1 RNA, seemed to increase the sensitivity of the highly resistant ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR10 to cisplatin. 20 Several common polymorphisms of the ERCC1 gene with proposed functional effects have been identified. The codon 118 C/T polymorphism is thought to affect mRNA levels 21 and showed a significant association with overall survival (OS) 22 , 23 and tumor response 24 in advanced colorectal cancer patients. However, the codon 118 polymorphism was not associated with OS in melanoma, 25 lung cancer, 26 or ovarian cancer 27 patients but was an independent predictor of reduced risk of platinum resistance, which was defined as disease recurrence within 6 months from the completion of chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. 27 A second polymorphism, C8092A, located in the 3? untranslated region, is thought to affect mRNA stability. 28 The C8092A polymorphism was associated with more favorable outcomes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients 29 and better OS in advanced non–small-cell lung cancer patients. 26 The use of ERCC1 genotyping to predict response to platinum-based chemotherapy and survival in epithelial cancers has not always produced consistent results. The aim of this current study was to evaluate associations between two common genetic variants in the ERCC1 gene and clinical outcomes in a phase III clinical trial of patients with optimally resected, stage III EOC treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel (C+P) administered via the intravenous (IV) versus intraperitoneal (IP) route conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG). By comparing the results between IV and IP groups in this relatively homogenous patient population who were consistently staged, treated, and evaluated, we could assess whether any observed associations were modified by the route of drug delivery. The influence of the route for chemotherapy administration is clinically relevant, and its relationship to genotype variations has never been studied.  PATIENTS AND METHODS Study Population Patients who participated in GOG-172 and provided blood specimens for translational research (TR) were included in this study. GOG-172 was a phase III randomized trial of IV versus IP C+P in patients with optimally resected, stage III EOC or primary peritoneal carcinoma. Details regarding eligibility criteria, treatment, and clinical outcomes have been previously published. 14 In brief, patients with no residual mass ? 1.0 cm after surgery were randomly assigned to receive either 135 mg of IV paclitaxel per square meter (m2) of body-surface area over a 24-hour period followed by either 75 mg of IV cisplatin/m2 on day 2 (IV arm) or 100 mg of IP cisplatin/m2 on day 2 and 60 mg of IP paclitaxel/mm2 on day 8 (IP arm). Treatment was administered every 3 weeks for six cycles. Patients provided written informed consent to participate in GOG-172 and provided a blood specimen for TR consistent with all federal, state, and local requirements before enrollment onto the study. Isolation of DNA DNA was extracted from WBCs recovered from whole blood using the Puregene DNA purification kit (GentraSystems Inc, Minneapolis, MN) or the ABI PRISM 6100 Nucleic Acid Prep Station (Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City, CA). 30 Genotyping The ERCC1 codon 118 and C8092A polymorphisms were detected by polymerase chain reactions (PCR), followed by pyrosequencing. For codon 118, a 413-base pair region was amplified in a standard PCR mixture of template DNA, a biotin-labeled forward primer 5?/5Bio/GTG-CGA-GGA-GGC-AGG-AGG-TGT-GGG-3?, and the reverse primer 5?-TGT-TGC-ACT-GGG-CAC-CTC-CAG-GCC-3? (IDT DNA, Coralville, IA). A 255-base pair region for C8092A was amplified in a PCR mixture of template DNA, forward primer 5?/TGA-GCC-AAT-TCA-GCC-ACT-3, and a biotin-labeled reverse primer 5?-/5Bio/TAG-TTC-CTC-AGT-TTC-CCG-3. The sequencing primer for codon 118 was 5?-ACG-TCG-CCA-AAT-TCC-CAG-GG-3?, and the primer for C8092A was 5?/AGG-CCG-GGA-CAA-GAA-GCG-GA-3. Pyrosequencing was completed using the PSQ96 MA and the SQA reagent kit (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden). Statistical Analysis Clinical and follow-up data were prospectively collected as required by the protocol. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the time from study entry until disease recurrence or death, whichever came first. OS was the time from study entry until death regardless of cause. Associations between ERCC1 polymorphisms and clinical characteristics were evaluated using Pearson’s ? 2 test or Fisher’s exact test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate PFS and OS by genotype, and the log-rank test was used to compare the survival distributions. Associations between ERCC1 polymorphisms and PFS and OS were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards analyses using reduced models adjusted for histology (clear cell/mucinous v other histologic subtypes), residual disease status (gross v none or microscopic tumor), and treatment arm (IP v IV). These covariates were chosen based on their documented prognostic relevance in a GOG meta-analysis in this patient population 31 and univariate Cox modeling in this cohort. Additional Cox modeling was performed with adjustments for patient age, race, performance status, histologic cell type, tumor grade, residual disease status, and treatment regimen. The results and conclusions from the full models were similar to those obtained using the reduced models. Because of the small number of patients with A/A genotype for ERCC1 C8092A polymorphism, C/A and A/A genotypes were combined in the analysis, as suggested in other studies. 26 , 32 The subgroup analysis in IV-versus IP-treated patients was exploratory. All statistical testing was two-sided and performed using SAS Version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

All statistical testing was two-sided and performed using SAS Version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  RESULTS Of the 429 women enrolled onto GOG-172, 371 provided a satisfactory blood specimen for TR. Leukocyte DNA was prepared and used to examine mutations in BRCA1 (unpublished data) and CHEK2. 30 Only 233 women had sufficient DNA left over for genotyping codon 118 and the C8092A region of the ERCC1 gene. Patient characteristics for the 233 women in this cohort are listed in Table 1 and are representative of those observed in the entire GOG-172 cohort. 14 Median age of the participants at enrollment was 56.9 years, most of the patients (91.9%) were white, and 93.2% of the patients had a GOG performance status of 0 to 1. The majority of tumors (76.8%) were serous histology, and most patients (58%) had gross residual disease at the completion of surgery. Women were randomly allocated to receive IV C+P (54.5%) or IP C+P (45.5%; Table 1 ). At the time of the analysis, the median follow-up time for those still alive was 75 months (range, 10 to 101 months); 57 women were alive with no evidence of disease, 34 women were alive with documented recurrence/disease progression, and 142 women died. The cause of death was disease progression in 113 patients, treatment in three patients, both disease progression and treatment in two patients, and other reasons in 24 patients. Among the 233 eligible patients, the genotype distribution at codon 118 was 17.2% with C/C, 43.4% with C/T, and 39.5% with T/T, and the genotype distribution at C8092A was 56.2% with C/C, 36.9% with C/A, and 6.9% with A/A. Both distributions were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There were no associations between codon 118 or C8092A polymorphisms in ERCC1 and patient age, tumor grade, histology, tumor residual volume, or treatment regimen ( Table 2 ). Although only a limited number of African American women were enrolled onto GOG-172 and provided specimens for this project (n = 7), all of these patients had the C/C genotype for codon 118 ( P < .001), and five of them had the C/A or A/A genotype in the C8092A polymorphism in the ERCC1 gene ( P = .08). Table 2 illustrates the strong association between the codon 118 genotypes in ERCC1 and the C8092A genotypes in ERCC1 ( P < .001). Specifically, 85% of the women with a C/C genotype in codon 118 exhibited the C/A or A/A genotypes in C8092A, and 97% of the women with the T/T genotype in codon 118 displayed the C/C genotype in C8092A. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in either PFS or OS among women with the C/T or T/T genotype in codon 118 of the ERCC1 gene compared with women with the C/C genotype ( Figs 1A and 1B ; Table 3 ). These results were consistent with those obtained using a Cox regression model for PFS or OS with adjustments for the prognostic factors (histologic cell type, residual disease status, and treatment) in this patient population ( Table 4 ). Similar results were obtained with the full Cox model described in Patients and Methods ( Appendix Table A1 , online only). There were no differences in risk of disease progression or death by codon 118 genotype for women treated with C+P administered IP or IV ( Table 4 ). Analysis of the C8092A polymorphism in ERCC1 demonstrated an association with prognosis ( Figs 1C and 1D ; Tables 3 and 4 ). When compared with women exhibiting the C8092A C/C genotype, women carrying at least one A allele (C/A or AA) had a 6-month shorter median PFS time and a 17-month shorter median OS time ( Table 3 ). Kaplan-Meier plots illustrate the differences in PFS ( Fig 1C ; P = .051) and OS ( Fig 1D ; P = .047) distributions for women categorized by C8092A polymorphisms in ERCC1. After adjusting for the prognostic factors in this patient population (histologic cell type, residual disease status, and treatment arm), women with the C/A or A/A genotype at C8092A had an increased risk of disease progression (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.94; P = .018) and death (HR = 1.50; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.09; P = .018) compared with women with the C/C genotype ( Table 4 ). Similar results were obtained with the full Cox model described in Patients and Methods ( Appendix Table A1 ) and when both ERCC1 polymorphisms were included in reduced multivariate Cox models (data not shown). Next, we explored whether the association between C8092A genotype in the ERCC1 gene and clinical outcome was modified by the route of drug delivery. Of the 233 women in this cohort, 106 and 127 women were randomly assigned to the IP or IV arm, respectively. There were no differences in the clinical characteristics in these subgroups ( Table 1 ). Subset analysis stratified by treatment regimen demonstrated a distinct PFS ( Fig 2A ) and OS ( Fig 2B ) advantage for women with the C8092A C/C genotype compared with women with either the C/A or A/A genotype in patients randomly allocated to the IP treatment arm ( Figs 2C and 2D ). Adjusted Cox regression analysis ( Table 4 ) suggested that women with a C/A or A/A genotype, compared with a C/C genotype, had a significantly higher risk of disease progression (HR = 1.81; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.88) and death (HR = 1.96; 95% CI, 1.17 to 3.30) when randomly assigned to the IP arm versus the IV arm (PFS: HR = 1.21; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.80; OS: HR = 1.27; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.97). Although the subset analysis suggested that the effect of the C/C genotype was more evident for IP patients, this study was underpowered to evaluate an interaction between genotype and treatment arm.  RESULTS Of the 429 women enrolled onto GOG-172, 371 provided a satisfactory blood specimen for TR.

Both distributions were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There were no associations between codon 118 or C8092A polymorphisms in ERCC1 and patient age, tumor grade, histology, tumor residual volume, or treatment regimen ( Table 2 ).

Table 2 illustrates the strong association between the codon 118 genotypes in ERCC1 and the C8092A genotypes in ERCC1 ( P < .001). Specifically, 85% of the women with a C/C genotype in codon 118 exhibited the C/A or A/A genotypes in C8092A, and 97% of the women with the T/T genotype in codon 118 displayed the C/C genotype in C8092A. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in either PFS or OS among women with the C/T or T/T genotype in codon 118 of the ERCC1 gene compared with women with the C/C genotype ( Figs 1A and 1B ; Table 3 ). These results were consistent with those obtained using a Cox regression model for PFS or OS with adjustments for the prognostic factors (histologic cell type, residual disease status, and treatment) in this patient population ( Table 4 ). Similar results were obtained with the full Cox model described in Patients and Methods ( Appendix Table A1 , online only). There were no differences in risk of disease progression or death by codon 118 genotype for women treated with C+P administered IP or IV ( Table 4 ). Analysis of the C8092A polymorphism in ERCC1 demonstrated an association with prognosis ( Figs 1C and 1D ; Tables 3 and 4 ). When compared with women exhibiting the C8092A C/C genotype, women carrying at least one A allele (C/A or AA) had a 6-month shorter median PFS time and a 17-month shorter median OS time ( Table 3 ). Kaplan-Meier plots illustrate the differences in PFS ( Fig 1C ; P = .051) and OS ( Fig 1D ; P = .047) distributions for women categorized by C8092A polymorphisms in ERCC1. After adjusting for the prognostic factors in this patient population (histologic cell type, residual disease status, and treatment arm), women with the C/A or A/A genotype at C8092A had an increased risk of disease progression (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.94; P = .018) and death (HR = 1.50; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.09; P = .018) compared with women with the C/C genotype ( Table 4 ). Similar results were obtained with the full Cox model described in Patients and Methods ( Appendix Table A1 ) and when both ERCC1 polymorphisms were included in reduced multivariate Cox models (data not shown). Next, we explored whether the association between C8092A genotype in the ERCC1 gene and clinical outcome was modified by the route of drug delivery. Of the 233 women in this cohort, 106 and 127 women were randomly assigned to the IP or IV arm, respectively. There were no differences in the clinical characteristics in these subgroups ( Table 1 ). Subset analysis stratified by treatment regimen demonstrated a distinct PFS ( Fig 2A ) and OS ( Fig 2B ) advantage for women with the C8092A C/C genotype compared with women with either the C/A or A/A genotype in patients randomly allocated to the IP treatment arm ( Figs 2C and 2D ). Adjusted Cox regression analysis ( Table 4 ) suggested that women with a C/A or A/A genotype, compared with a C/C genotype, had a significantly higher risk of disease progression (HR = 1.81; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.88) and death (HR = 1.96; 95% CI, 1.17 to 3.30) when randomly assigned to the IP arm versus the IV arm (PFS: HR = 1.21; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.80; OS: HR = 1.27; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.97). Although the subset analysis suggested that the effect of the C/C genotype was more evident for IP patients, this study was underpowered to evaluate an interaction between genotype and treatment arm.  DISCUSSION Common functional genetic polymorphisms in ERCC1 exist in the population in exon sites (codon 118), as well as in the 3? untranslated region ( C8092A ). Both variants are thought to affect ERCC1 levels and have been associated with clinical outcomes in patients treated with various platinum analogs. Polymorphisms at codon 118 have been studied extensively, with variable results. Our study indicates that the ERCC1 codon 118 C/T polymorphism was not associated with differences in PFS or OS in women with optimally resected stage III EOC. C/C genotype was associated with better outcome in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, 23 patients with refractory colorectal cancer, 33 and two of three studies in lung cancer patients, 26 , 34 , 35 whereas the T/T genotype was associated with better tumor response in advanced colorectal carcinomas. 24 In addition, melanoma patients treated with cisplatin had a less favorable response when carrying the C/C genotype. 25 Kang et al 27 studied a small series of ovarian cancer patients and reported that the codon 118 polymorphism in ERCC1 was an independent predictor of reduced risk of platinum resistance, which was defined as disease recurrence within 6 months from the completion of chemotherapy, but was not associated with OS. Smith et al 36 demonstrated that the C/C genotype in codon 118 of ERCC1 was associated with an increased risk of disease progression (HR = 1.95, P = .051) and death (HR = 2.01, P = .033) in women with EOC treated with platinum without paclitaxel but not in EOC patients treated with platinum and paclitaxel, suggesting that the influence of the codon 118 genotype on the responsiveness of platinum therapy may be minimized by the addition of a taxane, which targets tubulin rather than DNA. The 233 women in our cohort were all treated with C+P, which may explain why we did not see a significant association between the codon 118 polymorphisms in ERCC1 and either PFS or OS. Finally, Marsh et al 37 did not find any evidence of an association between the codon 118 polymorphism in ERCC1 and PFS, CA125 response, or clinical/radiographic response in women with EOC treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel or docetaxel. The C8092A polymorphism in ERCC1 has not been studied as extensively as the codon 118 variant. In a study of 128 patients with advanced non–small-cell lung cancer, Zhou et al 26 demonstrated a significant association between the C/C genotype and OS. Consistent with this finding, we observed a significant association between the C8092A polymorphism in ERCC1 and OS. We also observed a statistically significant association between the C8092A polymorphism in ERCC1 and PFS. Marsh et al 37 did not find any statistical evidence of an association between this ERCC1 polymorphism and PFS, CA125 response, or clinical/radiographic response in EOC. Inconsistencies in the reported data for the codon 118 and C8092A genotypes in ERCC1 could be attributable, at least in part, to differences in tumor biology, cancer types, stage of disease, responsiveness to C+P, study design, and sample size between the published studies. It is also possible that the ERCC1 polymorphisms do not directly affect treatment outcomes, but rather are in linkage disequilibrium with another causative locus. The possibility of increased chemotherapy toxicity leading to this inconsistency in outcomes was also evaluated. There was no association between ERCC1 polymorphisms and common grade 3 or 4 adverse effects (data not shown). To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a 6-month and 17-month median PFS and OS advantage, respectively, in EOC patients with the C/C genotype compared with the C/A or A/A genotypes in the C8092A region of the ERCC1 gene and to demonstrate that the C8092A polymorphism is an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS in optimally resected, stage III EOC. There was great interest in assessing whether the association between genotype and clinical outcome was modified by the route of drug delivery. Although this study was not powered to evaluate an interaction between ERCC1 genotype and treatment arm, exploratory analyses were performed to prioritize future studies. An exploratory subset analysis stratified by treatment provided suggestive evidence that the associations between the C8092A polymorphism and clinical outcome were most pronounced in the IP arm. Median PFS and OS times for women with the C8092A C/C genotype were 8 and 25 months longer, respectively, for women on IP versus IV therapy ( Table 3 ). In contrast, median PFS and OS times for women with at least one A allele in C8092A were similar for women on IP versus IV therapy ( Table 3 ). A larger study is required to validate the observation that women with the C8092A C/C genotype had a significant PFS and OS advantage when treated with IP versus IV C+P, whereas women with the C/A or A/A genotype had similar risks for disease progression and death when treated with IP versus IV C+P. If these associations are confirmed, testing for the C/C genotype in the C8092A region of the ERCC1 gene may serve as a potential prescreening test for women contemplating IP therapy, enabling clinicians and patients to make more informed treatment management decisions. It may be that the effects of variant genotypes are mild, and only with differential drug distribution and higher levels of drug at the tumor site do you observe an association between the C/C genotype and phenotype (clinical outcome). It is also possible that the C8092A C/C genotype in ERCC1 may be in linkage disequilibrium with another causative locus. Alternatively, the effects of C/C genotype may be enhanced in women who have a better prognosis as a result of the treatment arm, and thus, their survival may be affected by factors other than treatment (eg, younger age and better performance status, which may improve patients’ tolerance of chemotherapy and the IP catheter). The results of the primary analysis in all participants and the exploratory subset analysis in women randomly assigned to IP versus IV C+P therapy are intriguing, but larger studies are required to validate these associations, and mechanistic studies are needed to ascertain the nature of this relationship (eg, whether the C8092A C/C genotype alters cisplatin sensitivity, is associated with another prognostic factor through linkage, or is preferentially observed in women who can tolerate six cycles of IP therapy).  DISCUSSION Common functional genetic polymorphisms in ERCC1 exist in the population in exon sites (codon 118), as well as in the 3? untranslated region ( C8092A ). Both variants are thought to affect ERCC1 levels and have been associated with clinical outcomes in patients treated with various platinum analogs. Polymorphisms at codon 118 have been studied extensively, with variable results. Our study indicates that the ERCC1 codon 118 C/T polymorphism was not associated with differences in PFS or OS in women with optimally resected stage III EOC. C/C genotype was associated with better outcome in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, 23 patients with refractory colorectal cancer, 33 and two of three studies in lung cancer patients, 26 , 34 , 35 whereas the T/T genotype was associated with better tumor response in advanced colorectal carcinomas. 24 In addition, melanoma patients treated with cisplatin had a less favorable response when carrying the C/C genotype. 25 Kang et al 27 studied a small series of ovarian cancer patients and reported that the codon 118 polymorphism in ERCC1 was an independent predictor of reduced risk of platinum resistance, which was defined as disease recurrence within 6 months from the completion of chemotherapy, but was not associated with OS. Smith et al 36 demonstrated that the C/C genotype in codon 118 of ERCC1 was associated with an increased risk of disease progression (HR = 1.95, P = .051) and death (HR = 2.01, P = .033) in women with EOC treated with platinum without paclitaxel but not in EOC patients treated with platinum and paclitaxel, suggesting that the influence of the codon 118 genotype on the responsiveness of platinum therapy may be minimized by the addition of a taxane, which targets tubulin rather than DNA. The 233 women in our cohort were all treated with C+P, which may explain why we did not see a significant association between the codon 118 polymorphisms in ERCC1 and either PFS or OS. Finally, Marsh et al 37 did not find any evidence of an association between the codon 118 polymorphism in ERCC1 and PFS, CA125 response, or clinical/radiographic response in women with EOC treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel or docetaxel. The C8092A polymorphism in ERCC1 has not been studied as extensively as the codon 118 variant. In a study of 128 patients with advanced non–small-cell lung cancer, Zhou et al 26 demonstrated a significant association between the C/C genotype and OS. Consistent with this finding, we observed a significant association between the C8092A polymorphism in ERCC1 and OS. We also observed a statistically significant association between the C8092A polymorphism in ERCC1 and PFS. Marsh et al 37 did not find any statistical evidence of an association between this ERCC1 polymorphism and PFS, CA125 response, or clinical/radiographic response in EOC. Inconsistencies in the reported data for the codon 118 and C8092A genotypes in ERCC1 could be attributable, at least in part, to differences in tumor biology, cancer types, stage of disease, responsiveness to C+P, study design, and sample size between the published studies. It is also possible that the ERCC1 polymorphisms do not directly affect treatment outcomes, but rather are in linkage disequilibrium with another causative locus. The possibility of increased chemotherapy toxicity leading to this inconsistency in outcomes was also evaluated. There was no association between ERCC1 polymorphisms and common grade 3 or 4 adverse effects (data not shown). To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a 6-month and 17-month median PFS and OS advantage, respectively, in EOC patients with the C/C genotype compared with the C/A or A/A genotypes in the C8092A region of the ERCC1 gene and to demonstrate that the C8092A polymorphism is an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS in optimally resected, stage III EOC. There was great interest in assessing whether the association between genotype and clinical outcome was modified by the route of drug delivery. Although this study was not powered to evaluate an interaction between ERCC1 genotype and treatment arm, exploratory analyses were performed to prioritize future studies. An exploratory subset analysis stratified by treatment provided suggestive evidence that the associations between the C8092A polymorphism and clinical outcome were most pronounced in the IP arm. Median PFS and OS times for women with the C8092A C/C genotype were 8 and 25 months longer, respectively, for women on IP versus IV therapy ( Table 3 ). In contrast, median PFS and OS times for women with at least one A allele in C8092A were similar for women on IP versus IV therapy ( Table 3 ). A larger study is required to validate the observation that women with the C8092A C/C genotype had a significant PFS and OS advantage when treated with IP versus IV C+P, whereas women with the C/A or A/A genotype had similar risks for disease progression and death when treated with IP versus IV C+P. If these associations are confirmed, testing for the C/C genotype in the C8092A region of the ERCC1 gene may serve as a potential prescreening test for women contemplating IP therapy, enabling clinicians and patients to make more informed treatment management decisions. It may be that the effects of variant genotypes are mild, and only with differential drug distribution and higher levels of drug at the tumor site do you observe an association between the C/C genotype and phenotype (clinical outcome). It is also possible that the C8092A C/C genotype in ERCC1 may be in linkage disequilibrium with another causative locus. Alternatively, the effects of C/C genotype may be enhanced in women who have a better prognosis as a result of the treatment arm, and thus, their survival may be affected by factors other than treatment (eg, younger age and better performance status, which may improve patients’ tolerance of chemotherapy and the IP catheter). The results of the primary analysis in all participants and the exploratory subset analysis in women randomly assigned to IP versus IV C+P therapy are intriguing, but larger studies are required to validate these associations, and mechanistic studies are needed to ascertain the nature of this relationship (eg, whether the C8092A C/C genotype alters cisplatin sensitivity, is associated with another prognostic factor through linkage, or is preferentially observed in women who can tolerate six cycles of IP therapy).
