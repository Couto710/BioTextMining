The demographic burden of urologic diseases in America  Conclusions The burden of urological disease on the American public by any measure is immense. It is shifting and deserves ongoing attention as a topic of clinical investigation, epidemiologic analyses and health services research. UDA analyses have leveraged existing national data sets to identify opportunities to improve the quality of care and reduce disparities in care. To be sure, documenting emerging and evolving trends in epidemiology, practice patterns, resource utilization, technology diffusion and costs for urological disease has broad implications for quality, access to care and the equitable allocation of scarce resources in terms of medical services and research budgets. The Urologic Diseases in America project represents a major step toward accomplishing these goals. Further details on the methods and results, as well as free, downloadable UDA chapters, are publicly available at www.uda.niddk.nih.gov and www.udaonline.net .
