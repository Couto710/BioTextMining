Endocytoscopy in Esophageal Cancer The ability to visualize in vivo microscopic areas of neoplasia within gastrointestinal mucosa has been a major quest of modern gastroenterology. The attainment of this goal could revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of neoplastic disease. Potential benefits could include the elimination of random biopsies for surveillance of mucosal disease and increasing time intervals between surveillance endoscopy, elimination of sampling error issues, decrease inter-procedural discrepancies regarding the presence and magnitude of dysplasia present and ultimately to improve patient outcomes with at risk neoplasia. Recent advances in endocytoscopy can help guide the early detection of malignancy and lead to earlier treatment. Endocytoscopy is a new imaging and magnification technology classified as one of the “contact devices”, has been developed for observation of cellular structure in vivo with particular application in the esophagus. The technology can provide accurate targeting of lesions with an in vivo “virtual histological diagnosis” and could enhance endoscopic surveillance by decreasing biopsies of normal appearing mucosa. The purpose of this review is to survey the technology available and examine the literature to date regarding its clinical usage. We will also conclude this review with potential future directions.
