A multi-stage genome-wide association in breast cancer identifies two novel risk alleles at 1p11.2 and 14q24.1 ( RAD51L1 ) The Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) initiative has conducted a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of breast cancer in 9,770 cases and 10,799 controls. In Stage 1, we genotyped 528,173 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1,145 cases of invasive breast cancer among postmenopausal white women, and 1,142 controls; in Stage 2, 24,909 SNPs with low p values observed in Stage 1 were analyzed in 4,547 cases and 4,434 controls. In Stage 3 we investigated 21 loci in 4,078 cases and 5,223 controls with low p values from Stage 1 and 2 combined. Two novel loci achieved genome-wide significance. A pericentromeric SNP on chromosome 1p11.2, rs11249433, (p=6.74 × 10-10 adjusted genotype test with 2 degrees of freedom) resides in a large block of linkage disequilibrium neighboring NOTCH2 and FCGR1B and is predominantly associated with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. A second SNP, rs999737 on chromosome 14q24.1 (p=1.74 × 10?7), localizes to RAD51L1, a gene in the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway, a prior candidate pathway for breast cancer susceptibility. We confirmed previously reported markers on chromosome 2q35, 5q11.2, 5p12, 8q24, 10q26, and 16q12.1. Our results underscore the importance of large-scale replication in the identification of low penetrance breast cancer alleles.  Methods (678) Initial Genome-wide Scan Genotyping Briefly, this study reports the follow-up genotyping of studies based on the previously reported genome-wide scan conducted in the prospective Nurses’ Health Study using the Human Hap500 Infinium Assay (Illumina) in 1,145 cases of women with post-menopausal breast cancer and 1,142 controls 11 . The details are reported elsewhere 11 . Quality control metrics included removal of samples with call rates under 90% and SNP assays with call rates under 95%. Subjects with more than 15% admixture of non-European background were removed from the analysis. Replication Samples In Stage 2, we genotyped 30,278 SNPs in four follow-up studies of women of European background with breast cancer totaling 4,547 cases and 4,434 controls drawn from the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II, the Prostate, Lung, Colon and Ovarian Screening Trial, part of the available Polish Breast Cancer Study and the observational arm of the Women’s Health Initiative. In Stage 3, we genotyped 24 SNPs in 4,078 cases of breast cancer in women of European background and 5,223 controls drawn from the CONOR Norwegian cohort, the remaining cases and controls of the Polish Breast Cancer Study, the U.S. Radiologic Technologists Study, the Nurses’ Health Study II, and the Women’s Health Study. These studies were approved by the appropriate institutional review boards. Replication Genotyping In Stages 2 and 3, we genotyped 18,282 unique subjects (excluding validation samples and study duplicates) passing sample handling quality control metrics in the Core Genotyping Facility of the National Cancer Institute. For NHS II and WHS, the 24 SNPs of Stage 3 were genotyped at the DF/HCC Genotyping Core at the Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA. Stage 2 was genotyped using a custom-designed iSelect assay from Illumina with content described above; 9,804 samples were attempted (including known duplicates). Using quality control measures, samples were removed with call rates under 90% and SNPs with call rates under 95%. Fitness for Hardy-Weinberg proportion was assessed for each SNP in unique controls subjects only but was not used to exclude SNP assays (see Supplemental Methods ). In Stage 3, we genotyped 9,301 unique subjects for 24 TaqMan assays (ABI) selected on the criteria described above using custom designed assays that were subsequently optimized in the SNP500Cancer initiative. A small fraction (less than 2%) of subjects who were successfully genotyped in Stage 2 were excluded from analysis due to one of the following reasons: 1. Unanticipated interstudy or intrastudy duplicates; 2. Unanticipated non-European admixture of greater than 20% (e.g., African or East Asian; notably, in Stage 1, the threshold for non-European admixture was 15%); and/or 3. Incomplete covariate data. In Stage 2, a total of 16,715 discordant genotypes were detected out of a possible 7,255,923 genotype comparisons (237 duplicate pairs and one triplicate) yielding a discordance rate of 0.23%. Infinium cluster plots for notable SNPs are included in Supplemental Methods . For the 24 SNPs analyzed in Stage 3, we validated genotype calls determined by Infinium HumanHap500 and custom iSelect assay by comparing TaqMan results in the entire Polish Breast Cancer Study. 1,110 samples were genotyped with both platforms and the overall concordance rate was 99.52% (see Supplemental Materials for results). Analysis For the follow-up replication studies, all one-SNP analyses were conducted using unconditional logistic regression, adjusted for age in ten year intervals and study. For Stages 1 and 2, four continuous covariates were included to account for population heterogeneity based on principal component analysis of genotype correlations. Separate analyses were conducted according to the individual studies, the pooled replication studies in Stage 2 and Stage 3 and for all studies combined. Genotype effects were modeled individually, and a single-SNP score test with two degrees of freedom was computed. To enable comparison with other published GWAS, a Cochran-Armitage trend test was also performed. To explore a possible difference in effect between estrogen-positive and estrogen-negative breast cancer, separate analyses were conducted for ER+ and ER? cases, using a trend test with 1 degree of freedom.. Informatics We used GLU (Genotyping Library and Utilities version 1.0), a suite of tools available as an open-source application for management, storage and analysis of GWAS data. STRUCTURE and EIGENSTRAT programs were used to assess population heterogeneity (see URLs below) URLs: CGEMS portal: http://cgems.cancer.gov/ CGF: http://cgf.nci.nih.gov/ EIGENSTRAT: http://genepath.med.harvard.edu/~reich/EIGENSTRAT.htm GLU: http://code.google.com/p/glu-genetics/ SNP500Cancer: http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov/ STRUCTURE: http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/structure.html Tagzilla: http://tagzilla.nci.nih.gov/  Initial Genome-wide Scan Genotyping Briefly, this study reports the follow-up genotyping of studies based on the previously reported genome-wide scan conducted in the prospective Nurses’ Health Study using the Human Hap500 Infinium Assay (Illumina) in 1,145 cases of women with post-menopausal breast cancer and 1,142 controls 11 .

A joint analysis of the genotypes was performed using an age, study design and population stratification-adjusted logistic regression analysis (2 df test). Dashed vertical lines indicate loci previously reported in GWAS 10 – 13 , 19 . The horizontal magenta line denotes the range of genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10?7). Black vertical arrows indicate loci explored in Stage 3 chosen on the basis of the p value. The magenta vertical arrow point to rs3817198 in the LSP1 gene. Blue dots denote the results of the genotype test and red dots denote the trend test. Figure 2 Linkage Disequilibrium plot of Two Novel Loci Both panels present the LD plots (using D’) for novel loci based on SNPs with MAF > 5% using HapMap Stage II individuals of European background (n=60 unrelated individuals). Above the plots are the results of the three individual Stages and the combined analysis for the SNPs reaching genome-wide significance. Panel A. Chromosome 1 region marked by rs11249433 and bounded by SNPs between chr1:120,400,700 ?121,060,765. Note that one side is closely anchored to the centromere while the region distal to the centromere is bounded by a “SNP desert” of approximately 220 kb. Panel B. Chromosome 14q24.1 region marked by rs999737 and the block resides in the intron between two exons, of which the last has been observed in one of the three splice variants observed. Note that the SNP is located in an intron exclusive to the longest predicted transcript of RAD51L1 . Figure 3 Forest plot for Overall, and ER+ and ER? Analysis, for rs 1124933 and rs999737 The results of the Overall Pooled analysis, and case-control analyses for ER+ cases, and ER?ve cases, were generated using a trend test with one degree of freedom. The figure includes per allele odd ratio (log additive/multiplicative model) for each study. For the overall analysis, the P-heterogeneity values are for rs1124933 P=0.44, and for rs999737 P=0.79. Data were available for estrogen-receptor status in 6,586 cases.
