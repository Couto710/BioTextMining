Up-regulation of anterior cingulate cortex NR2B receptors contributes to visceral pain responses in rats Background & Aims Electrophysiological and behavioral studies have demonstrated that increased N -methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neurons has a critical role in modulating visceral pain responses in viscerally hypersensitive (VH) rats. This study aimed to identify the NMDA receptor subtypes in perigenual ACC (pACC) neurons involved in the facilitation of visceral nociception. Methods We performed in vivo electrophysiological recordings of pACC neurons and examined the visceromotor response (VMR) to colorectal distention (CRD) in normal and VH rats induced by colonic anaphylaxis. The NR2A subtype receptor antagonist NVP-AAM077 and the NR2B receptor antagonist Ro25-6981 were microinjected into the pACC. To downregulate NR2B receptor gene expression, an NR2B-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and a plasmid (pEGFP-N1) that expressed the green fluorescent protein were administered into ACC neurons by electroporation. Results Reverse microdialysis of NVP-AAM077 had no effect on basal and CRD-induced ACC neuronal firing in VH and control groups. In VH rats, Ro25-6981 (500 ?M) inhibited ACC neuronal firing, evoked by 30 and 50 mmHg CRD, by 98%, and 52%, respectively. NVP-AAM077 did not affect the VMR in either group. Ro25-6981 significantly suppressed the VMR in VH but not normal rats. Immunoblot analysis showed increased NR2B receptor expression in the pACC of VH rats. NR2B siRNA-treated VH rats showed a significant reduction in the VMR, compared to controls. Conclusions The NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor has a critical role in the modulation of ACC sensitization and visceral pain responses in VH rats.  Introduction Human brain imaging studies have revealed new roles of cortical neuronal networks in chronic visceral pain. 1 Experiments in animals demonstrate that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) receives nociceptive inputs 2 – 4 and suggest that ACC neuronal activity is related to stimulus–reward learning. 5 Electrophysiological studies in our laboratories have demonstrated that ACC sensitization occurs in viscerally hypersensitive (VH) rats. 6 Allodynia and hyperalgesia in these rats appear to be mediated by enhanced glutamate N -methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activities in the ACC. 7 Hypersensitivity to colonic distention can be observed up to 7 weeks after the initiation of colonic anaphylaxis and is independent of mucosal inflammation. This suggests mediation by a mechanism for learning and triggering of pain memories in the ACC neuronal circuitry. Nociceptive transmission in the ACC is mediated by glutamate ?-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors in normal circumstances. In VH rats, the synaptic transmission in ACC neurons is enhanced. This enhancement is mediated mainly by NMDA receptor activation, 8 indicating neuronal plasticity in the ACC circuitry in the VH state. NMDA receptors contain heteromeric combinations of the NR1 subunit plus one or more of the subunits NR2A–2D. Whereas NR1 is distributed widely in the brain, NR2 subunits exhibit regional specificities. In humans and rodents, subunits NR2A and NR2B predominate in forebrain structures. 9 In the ACC, the NMDA receptor containing NR2A or NR2B subunits contributes to most NMDA receptor currents. 10 Mice that genetically overexpress the NR2B receptor subtype in the forebrain show enhanced responsiveness to painful stimuli 11 and superior learning ability and memory of different behavioral tasks. 12 Considering the distinct roles that NMDA receptors may serve, identification of the receptor subtype in the ACC that mediates visceral hypersensitivity will promote our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying nociceptive processes in the VH state. We hypothesize that ACC sensitization and visceral hyperalgesia in our VH rat model may be mediated by changes in the expression and the function of NMDA receptor subtypes in ACC neurons. To test this hypothesis, we used VH rats to characterize the electrophysiological properties of neurons of the perigenual ACC (pACC; i.e., areas 24b, 24a, and 32) 2 that are activated by colorectal distention (CRD). Single neuronal recording of pACC neurons was combined with reverse microdialysis of NR2A and NR2B subtype-selective NMDA receptor antagonists NVP-AAM077 and Ro25-6981 to identify which receptor subtypes mediate visceral hypersensitivity. The selectivity of these two antagonists has been established in vitro. 13 , 14 Visceromotor response (VMR) studies were conducted in parallel to examine the antinociceptive effects of subtype-selective NMDA receptor antagonists. Finally, to down-regulate the gene expression of the NR2B subtype of the NMDA receptor, NR2B-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) was administered into the pACC neurons of VH rats by electroporation. Our results suggest that activation of ACC NR2B-containing NMDA receptors may be involved in ACC sensitization and hyperalgesia in the VH state.  Methods We performed in vivo electrophysiological recordings of pACC neurons and examined the visceromotor response (VMR) to colorectal distention (CRD) in normal and VH rats induced by colonic anaphylaxis. The NR2A subtype receptor antagonist NVP-AAM077 and the NR2B receptor antagonist Ro25-6981 were microinjected into the pACC. To downregulate NR2B receptor gene expression, an NR2B-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and a plasmid (pEGFP-N1) that expressed the green fluorescent protein were administered into ACC neurons by electroporation.  Results Reverse microdialysis of NVP-AAM077 had no effect on basal and CRD-induced ACC neuronal firing in VH and control groups. In VH rats, Ro25-6981 (500 ?M) inhibited ACC neuronal firing, evoked by 30 and 50 mmHg CRD, by 98%, and 52%, respectively. NVP-AAM077 did not affect the VMR in either group. Ro25-6981 significantly suppressed the VMR in VH but not normal rats. Immunoblot analysis showed increased NR2B receptor expression in the pACC of VH rats. NR2B siRNA-treated VH rats showed a significant reduction in the VMR, compared to controls.  Conclusions The NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor has a critical role in the modulation of ACC sensitization and visceral pain responses in VH rats.  Materials and Methods Experimental procedures were approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals at the University of Michigan. Experiments were performed on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (275–300 g). The animals were housed 4 per plastic cage and maintained on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle (lights on at 7 AM) and given access to food and water ad libitum. For surgical preparations, rats were anesthetized with a mixture of xylazine and ketamine. 6 Viscerally hypersensitive (VH) rat model The rats were sensitized to chicken egg albumin (EA) with an intraperitoneal injection of normal saline (1 mL) containing EA (10 mg) as the antigen and aluminum hydroxide (10 mg) as the adjuvant. Beginning on day 3, the antigen solution was perfused into the colon and CRD was performed 30 min after EA instillation. VMR studies were conducted 5–7 days after the induction of colonic anaphylaxis. 7 , 8 Electrophysiological recording of pACC neuronal activity in response to CRD in control and VH rats Three cytoarchitectural regions of the cingulate cortex have been identified in rats: the ACC with perigenual and subgenual parts, midcingulate cortex, and retrosplenial cortex. 2 A similar classification has been applied to the rabbit. 3 In the present study, neurons were recorded in the perigenual ACC (pACC) using glass microelectrodes (tip diameters, 0.08 ?m and impedance of 20–40 M?) at the following coordinates: 2.0–3.8 mm anterior to bregma, 0.5–1.0 mm lateral to midline, 2.5 mm ventral to the brain surface. These areas correspond to perigenual 24b and portions of perigenual 24a and area 32. The recording electrode was advanced until the spontaneous activity of a single unit could be accurately discriminated from the background neuronal noise. The recording had uniform spike amplitude and could be maximized and separated from neighboring neurons. Noise levels were typically 40–50 ?V. We analyzed only well-isolated neurons that showed a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 4:1. 7 , 8 A neuron was deemed responsive to CRD if its spike firing rate increased or decreased at least 10% from its predistention baseline activity. Neuronal discharge rates were measured 30 s before, 30 s during, and 120 s after CRD, with 5-min intervals between each measurement, and evaluated on a time histogram (5 s bin width). On completion of the experiment, recorded neurons were labeled by injecting neurobiotin using the technique of juxtacellular iontophoresis. 7 Brain sections were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated avidin–biotin complex (ABC, 1:100; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Thionine was used as a counterstain. Data on spontaneous firings in various experimental groups were evaluated using the Dunnett T3 multiple comparisons method after 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical comparisons of the CRD-pressure responses in various groups were made using the 1-way repeated measures ANOVA, followed by multiple comparisons adjusted by the Bonferroni test. Results were expressed as means ± SEM. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Studies of antagonists of NMDA receptor subtypes The NR2A-selective antagonist [( R )-[( S )-1-(4-bromo-phenyl)-ethylamino]-(2,3-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalin-5-yl)-methyl]-phosphonic acid 15 (NVP-AAM077, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) or the NR2B-selective antagonist Ro25-6981 13 (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO) were infused into the pACC using reverse microdialysis. One dose of antagonist was applied to each CRD-excited neuron. Reverse microdialysis was performed as described previously. 8 , 16 Briefly, microdialysis probes with 3–4 mm of exposed membrane were implanted into the pACC at the following coordinates: 2.0–3.8 mm anterior to bregma, 0.5–1.0 mm lateral to midline; and lowered about 4.0 mm at a 30-degree angle. Glass microelectrodes filled with neurobiotin were lowered into the pACC about 1 mm lateral or rostral to the probe and angled at 10 degrees toward the probe. 7 Investigators have reported serial measurements of drug concentrations in tissue after microdialysis. 17 In our study, drugs were dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) at a concentration 100 times that predicted to be necessary according to data from in vitro studies. 18 ACSF containing NVP-AAM077 or Ro25-6981 (50, 100, and 500 ?mol/L) was perfused. The doses were chosen in accordance with the results of previous brain slice recordings in which NVP-AAM077 or Ro25-6981 at a concentration of 0.4–3.0 ?mol/L blocked cingulate NMDA excitatory postsynaptic currents 19 and cingulate long-term potentiation. 20 Electrophysiological recordings were performed as described above. Visceromotor response to CRD Details of this protocol have been described previously. 21 Briefly, 32-gauge stainless steel wires were implanted in the external oblique pelvic muscles 4–6 days before the beginning of the experimental procedures. Graded-pressure CRD (20, 40, and 60 mm Hg) was produced by rapidly injecting saline into a colonic balloon over 1 s and maintaining the distention for 20 s. The results of electromyography were quantified by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Statistical comparisons of the VMR in various groups were made using 1-way repeated measures ANOVA, followed by multiple comparisons adjusted by the Bonferroni test using baseline values as a covariate and two main factors (i.e., distention level as the repeated factor and group as the independent factor). Chronic ACC cannulation pACC cannulation was performed 7 using the following coordinates: AP +4.0 to +2.0 mm from bregma, DV ?2.5 mm, L +0.7 mm. The VMR experiments were performed 6 days postoperatively. The location of the point of termination of the cannula track was determined by histological studies. Serial coronal sections (50 ?m) were cut with a cryostat along the path of the cannula, mounted on gelatin-coated slides, and stained with thionine. Glutamate antagonist studies After establishing a stable VMR induced by graded-pressure CRD, the NR2B antagonist Ro25-6981 14 or the NR2A antagonist NVP-AAM077 13 were microinjected into the pACC. A total volume of 60 nL per hemisphere were administered. A similar volume of vehicle (saline) was administered into the pACC as a control. The 1 mmol/L and 10 mmol/L doses of Ro25-6981 and NVP-AAM077 were chosen in accordance with doses used in previous behavioral studies, which showed that microinjection of similar doses of NR2A and NR2B receptor antagonists into the perirhinal cortex or the ACC impaired long-term recognition memory and reduced mechanical allodynia, respectively. 22 , 23 Each rat served as its own control. Vehicle and a single drug were tested on each day. Two doses (1 mmol/L and 10 mmol/L) of Ro25-6981 or NVP-AAM077 were infused randomly into the pACC at 2-h intervals, by which time the VMR had returned to its preinjection level, as demonstrated in the pilot study. Microelectroporation of siRNA To inhibit NR2B expression specifically in the pACC, siRNA against NR2B with a reporter plasmid encoding EGFP was delivered bilaterally by microelectroporation. 24 Green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was used as a novel genetic reporter system.

Viscerally hypersensitive (VH) rat model The rats were sensitized to chicken egg albumin (EA) with an intraperitoneal injection of normal saline (1 mL) containing EA (10 mg) as the antigen and aluminum hydroxide (10 mg) as the adjuvant. Beginning on day 3, the antigen solution was perfused into the colon and CRD was performed 30 min after EA instillation.

Results Effects of NMDA receptor antagonists on pACC neuronal activation evoked by CRD in normal and VH rats A total of 25 control rats and 69 neurons were examined for their responses to CRD (50 mm Hg). Spontaneous activity was sufficiently stable to permit recording for 45–70 min. Among the 69 neurons, 18 neurons (26%) exhibited an excitatory response characterized by increased spike firing from baseline (7.0 ± 0.5 to 16.0 ± 1.0 impulses/10 s). These 18 neurons were referred to as CRD-excited neurons. Seven of 69 neurons were inhibited by 50 mm Hg CRD; their spontaneous activity was reduced to 0.35 ± 0.05 impulses/10 s. All 18 CRD-excited neurons were examined for the effects of the two glutamate antagonists on pACC neuronal responses to CRD. One dose of antagonist was applied to each CRD-excited pACC neuron. Microdialysis of vehicle (ACSF, 2 ?L/min) had no effect on pACC neuronal firing. Application of NR2A receptor antagonist NVP-AAM077 or NR2B receptor antagonist Ro25-6981 at concentrations of 100 ?mol/L and 500 ?mol/L did not change spontaneous firing. Intra-pACC administration of either receptor antagonist also had no effect on 50 mm Hg CRD-evoked pACC neuronal responses ( Fig. 1 A , 1 B ). In a separate study, 94 neurons from 31 VH rats were evaluated. Of these 94 neurons, 36 neurons (38%) were excited by 50 mm Hg CRD. This represents an increase in the numbers of CRD-excited pACC neurons in VH rats as compared with normal rats (38% vs 26%, P < 0.05). pACC spike firing in response to 50 mm Hg CRD increased from a basal level of 18.5 ± 2.0 to 42 ± 4.5 impulses/10 s ( Fig. 1 A , 1 B ) suggesting an increase in pACC neuronal excitability in VH rats. Microdialysis of NR2A receptor antagonist NVP-AAM077 at concentrations of 100 ?mol/L and 500 ?mol/L did not change pACC neuronal spontaneous firing and had no effect on 30 mm Hg and 50 mm Hg CRD-evoked pACC neuronal responses ( Fig. 1 B ). In contrast, microdialysis of the NR2B receptor antagonist Ro25-6981 at concentrations of 100 ?mol/L and 500 ?mol/L significantly decreased basal pACC neuronal firing from 21.0 ± 4.5 to 15.5 ± 3.0 and 10.5 ± 1.5 impulses 10/s, respectively ( Fig. 1 B ). Further, Ro25-6981 at concentrations of 100 ?mol/L and 500 ?mol/L produced 84% and 98% inhibition of 30 mm Hg CRD-induced neuronal firing, and 14% and 52% inhibition of 50 mm Hg CRD-induced neuronal firing (6 neurons in the normal group and 9 neurons in the EA group, P < 0.05) ( Fig. 1 B ). Administration of Ro25-6981 at 2.0 mmol/L did not cause further inhibition of basal and CRD-induced pACC neuronal firing ( Fig. 1 B ). Examples of original tracings are shown in Figure 2 A and 2 B . Histological localization of the CRD-responsive neurons showed that the recording electrodes were successfully placed in all of the CRD-exited neurons of normal and EA rats. Several examples of neurobiotin-labeled neurons are presented in Figures 2 C , 2 D , and 2 E . Effects of NMDA receptor antagonists on the VMR to CRD in normal and VH rats Both control and EA rats showed pressure-dependent increases in the VMR to CRD. These responses were significantly enhanced in EA rats. Graded CRD pressures of 20, 40, and 60 mm Hg caused an increase in the number of muscle contractions to 1 ± 0.02, 20 ± 4, and 31 ± 3 contractions/5 s, respectively, in normal rats, and to 24 ± 4, 41 ± 3, and 50 ± 5 contractions/5 s in EA rats. The mean amplitude of the electromyogram (area under the curve [AUC], ?V/s) is shown in Figure 3 . These results are consistent with enhanced visceral pain responses (i.e., hyperalgesia) in EA rats. 3 The specific NR2A subunit antagonist NVP-AAM077 and the specific NR2B subunit antagonist Ro25-6981 were microinjected into the pACC. A total of 12 normal rats and 13 EA rats were studied. Histological studies confirmed the accuracy of the microinjection sites in all but 2 normal rats and 1 EA rat. Hence, VMR data from 10 normal rats and 12 EA rats were analyzed. Several examples of the pACC injection sites are shown in Figure 4 . Microinjection of either NVP-AAM077 (1 and 10 mmol/L) or Ro25-6981 (1 and 10 mmol/L) 11 – 13 into the pACC (areas 24b, 24a, and 32) did not change the VMR to graded-pressure CRD in normal rats ( Fig. 3 ). These results suggest that the pACC neuronal network is not involved in the mediation of visceral pain responses in normal rats, confirming our previous investigations. 7 In EA rats, NVP-AAM077 had no effect on the VMR ( Fig. 3 B ), whereas Ro25-6981 dose-dependently decreased the VMR to CRD ( Fig. 3 A ). In response to graded CRD pressures of 20, 40, and 60 mm Hg, Ro25-6981 (1 mmol/L) reduced the number of muscle contractions from 25 ± 3, 43 ± 2, and 57 ± 6 contractions/5 s to 15 ± 2, 32 ± 4, and 46 ± 3 contractions/5 s, respectively, representing 40%, 26%, and 20% inhibition. Ro25-6981 at a dose of 10 mmol/L produced 52%, 30%, and 22% inhibition ( Fig. 3 A , P < 0.05). Application of 100 mmol/L Ro25-6981 did not produce additional inhibition. Bilateral microinjections of vehicle control (saline) did not significantly affect the VMR. These observations suggest that NMDA NR2B receptor activities in the pACC are responsible for allodynia and hyperalgesia in VH rats. Expression of NR2B and NR2A receptors in normal and EA rats The up-regulation of NR2B receptor protein was verified by Western blot analysis. Compared to control rats, the level of NR2B expression in the pACC was significantly increased in VH rats at 10 days after the induction of visceral hypersensitivity. Figure 4 shows an example of a Western immunoblot using polyclonal antibodies against the NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptors. Quantitative densitometry of the immunoblot bands for NR2B in EA rats was significantly increased to 169 ± 10% of the control ( Fig. 5 , n = 5 for each group, P < 0.05). The increase in NR2B expression was time dependent. The increased expression was maintained at 4 weeks after colonic anaphylaxis, but at 6 weeks the NR2B protein level was similar to that in saline-injected rats (data not shown). On the other hand, no significant increases in NR1 and NR2A protein expression were observed at 10 days (n = 4) after the induction of visceral hypersensitivity ( Fig. 4 ). These findings suggest that changes in NMDA receptors are selective for NR2B subunits in the pACC. The up-regulation of NMDA NR2B receptor expression is consistent with the hypothesis that the enhanced NR2B subunit of NMDA receptor activation mediates ACC neuronal sensitization and visceral hyperalgesia in VH rats. In this study, we did not specifically determine whether up-regulation of NR2B receptors occurred in some or all layers of the pACC of VH rats. Effects of NR2B siRNA on the CRD-evoked VMRs in normal and VH rats Western blots were performed to confirm the effectiveness, specificity, and time course of RNA interference (RNAi)-induced gene silencing by electroporation of NR2B siRNA ( Fig. 6 ). Immunohistochemistry showed GFP expression and a lack of NR2B expression in the pACC after NR2B siRNA administration ( Fig. 7 A , 7 B ). Examples of electroporation sites in 3 rats are shown in Figures 7 C , 7 D , and 7 E . Guided by the data from the Western blot analysis and the recovery time of the animals, VMRs to graded-pressure CRD were measured 4 days after electroporation. Results were obtained from 6 normal rats and 6 VH rats. In VH rats, electroporation of NR2B-specific siRNA into the pACC significantly decreased the VMR to 20, 40, and 60 mm Hg CRD from 24 ± 3, 43 ± 5, and 58 ± 4 contractions/5 s in the control siRNA group to 10 ± 1, 25 ± 4, and 40 ± 3 contractions/5 s in NR2B siRNA-injected rats. The mean amplitudes expressed as AUC are shown in Figure 8 . Administration of NR2B siRNA produced a 58%, 42%, and 31% inhibition of VMR to 20, 40, and 60 mm Hg CRD, respectively. However, pACC electroporation of NR2B siRNA in normal rats had no significant effect on the VMR to all CRD pressures. Considered together, this suggests that activation of NR2B in the pACC plays a critical role in the mediation of visceral hyperalgesia in VH rats.  Results Effects of NMDA receptor antagonists on pACC neuronal activation evoked by CRD in normal and VH rats A total of 25 control rats and 69 neurons were examined for their responses to CRD (50 mm Hg). Spontaneous activity was sufficiently stable to permit recording for 45–70 min. Among the 69 neurons, 18 neurons (26%) exhibited an excitatory response characterized by increased spike firing from baseline (7.0 ± 0.5 to 16.0 ± 1.0 impulses/10 s). These 18 neurons were referred to as CRD-excited neurons. Seven of 69 neurons were inhibited by 50 mm Hg CRD; their spontaneous activity was reduced to 0.35 ± 0.05 impulses/10 s. All 18 CRD-excited neurons were examined for the effects of the two glutamate antagonists on pACC neuronal responses to CRD. One dose of antagonist was applied to each CRD-excited pACC neuron. Microdialysis of vehicle (ACSF, 2 ?L/min) had no effect on pACC neuronal firing. Application of NR2A receptor antagonist NVP-AAM077 or NR2B receptor antagonist Ro25-6981 at concentrations of 100 ?mol/L and 500 ?mol/L did not change spontaneous firing. Intra-pACC administration of either receptor antagonist also had no effect on 50 mm Hg CRD-evoked pACC neuronal responses ( Fig. 1 A , 1 B ). In a separate study, 94 neurons from 31 VH rats were evaluated. Of these 94 neurons, 36 neurons (38%) were excited by 50 mm Hg CRD. This represents an increase in the numbers of CRD-excited pACC neurons in VH rats as compared with normal rats (38% vs 26%, P < 0.05). pACC spike firing in response to 50 mm Hg CRD increased from a basal level of 18.5 ± 2.0 to 42 ± 4.5 impulses/10 s ( Fig. 1 A , 1 B ) suggesting an increase in pACC neuronal excitability in VH rats. Microdialysis of NR2A receptor antagonist NVP-AAM077 at concentrations of 100 ?mol/L and 500 ?mol/L did not change pACC neuronal spontaneous firing and had no effect on 30 mm Hg and 50 mm Hg CRD-evoked pACC neuronal responses ( Fig. 1 B ). In contrast, microdialysis of the NR2B receptor antagonist Ro25-6981 at concentrations of 100 ?mol/L and 500 ?mol/L significantly decreased basal pACC neuronal firing from 21.0 ± 4.5 to 15.5 ± 3.0 and 10.5 ± 1.5 impulses 10/s, respectively ( Fig. 1 B ). Further, Ro25-6981 at concentrations of 100 ?mol/L and 500 ?mol/L produced 84% and 98% inhibition of 30 mm Hg CRD-induced neuronal firing, and 14% and 52% inhibition of 50 mm Hg CRD-induced neuronal firing (6 neurons in the normal group and 9 neurons in the EA group, P < 0.05) ( Fig. 1 B ). Administration of Ro25-6981 at 2.0 mmol/L did not cause further inhibition of basal and CRD-induced pACC neuronal firing ( Fig. 1 B ). Examples of original tracings are shown in Figure 2 A and 2 B . Histological localization of the CRD-responsive neurons showed that the recording electrodes were successfully placed in all of the CRD-exited neurons of normal and EA rats. Several examples of neurobiotin-labeled neurons are presented in Figures 2 C , 2 D , and 2 E . Effects of NMDA receptor antagonists on the VMR to CRD in normal and VH rats Both control and EA rats showed pressure-dependent increases in the VMR to CRD. These responses were significantly enhanced in EA rats. Graded CRD pressures of 20, 40, and 60 mm Hg caused an increase in the number of muscle contractions to 1 ± 0.02, 20 ± 4, and 31 ± 3 contractions/5 s, respectively, in normal rats, and to 24 ± 4, 41 ± 3, and 50 ± 5 contractions/5 s in EA rats. The mean amplitude of the electromyogram (area under the curve [AUC], ?V/s) is shown in Figure 3 . These results are consistent with enhanced visceral pain responses (i.e., hyperalgesia) in EA rats. 3 The specific NR2A subunit antagonist NVP-AAM077 and the specific NR2B subunit antagonist Ro25-6981 were microinjected into the pACC. A total of 12 normal rats and 13 EA rats were studied. Histological studies confirmed the accuracy of the microinjection sites in all but 2 normal rats and 1 EA rat. Hence, VMR data from 10 normal rats and 12 EA rats were analyzed. Several examples of the pACC injection sites are shown in Figure 4 . Microinjection of either NVP-AAM077 (1 and 10 mmol/L) or Ro25-6981 (1 and 10 mmol/L) 11 – 13 into the pACC (areas 24b, 24a, and 32) did not change the VMR to graded-pressure CRD in normal rats ( Fig. 3 ). These results suggest that the pACC neuronal network is not involved in the mediation of visceral pain responses in normal rats, confirming our previous investigations. 7 In EA rats, NVP-AAM077 had no effect on the VMR ( Fig. 3 B ), whereas Ro25-6981 dose-dependently decreased the VMR to CRD ( Fig. 3 A ). In response to graded CRD pressures of 20, 40, and 60 mm Hg, Ro25-6981 (1 mmol/L) reduced the number of muscle contractions from 25 ± 3, 43 ± 2, and 57 ± 6 contractions/5 s to 15 ± 2, 32 ± 4, and 46 ± 3 contractions/5 s, respectively, representing 40%, 26%, and 20% inhibition. Ro25-6981 at a dose of 10 mmol/L produced 52%, 30%, and 22% inhibition ( Fig. 3 A , P < 0.05). Application of 100 mmol/L Ro25-6981 did not produce additional inhibition. Bilateral microinjections of vehicle control (saline) did not significantly affect the VMR. These observations suggest that NMDA NR2B receptor activities in the pACC are responsible for allodynia and hyperalgesia in VH rats. Expression of NR2B and NR2A receptors in normal and EA rats The up-regulation of NR2B receptor protein was verified by Western blot analysis. Compared to control rats, the level of NR2B expression in the pACC was significantly increased in VH rats at 10 days after the induction of visceral hypersensitivity. Figure 4 shows an example of a Western immunoblot using polyclonal antibodies against the NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptors. Quantitative densitometry of the immunoblot bands for NR2B in EA rats was significantly increased to 169 ± 10% of the control ( Fig. 5 , n = 5 for each group, P < 0.05). The increase in NR2B expression was time dependent. The increased expression was maintained at 4 weeks after colonic anaphylaxis, but at 6 weeks the NR2B protein level was similar to that in saline-injected rats (data not shown). On the other hand, no significant increases in NR1 and NR2A protein expression were observed at 10 days (n = 4) after the induction of visceral hypersensitivity ( Fig. 4 ). These findings suggest that changes in NMDA receptors are selective for NR2B subunits in the pACC. The up-regulation of NMDA NR2B receptor expression is consistent with the hypothesis that the enhanced NR2B subunit of NMDA receptor activation mediates ACC neuronal sensitization and visceral hyperalgesia in VH rats. In this study, we did not specifically determine whether up-regulation of NR2B receptors occurred in some or all layers of the pACC of VH rats. Effects of NR2B siRNA on the CRD-evoked VMRs in normal and VH rats Western blots were performed to confirm the effectiveness, specificity, and time course of RNA interference (RNAi)-induced gene silencing by electroporation of NR2B siRNA ( Fig. 6 ). Immunohistochemistry showed GFP expression and a lack of NR2B expression in the pACC after NR2B siRNA administration ( Fig. 7 A , 7 B ). Examples of electroporation sites in 3 rats are shown in Figures 7 C , 7 D , and 7 E . Guided by the data from the Western blot analysis and the recovery time of the animals, VMRs to graded-pressure CRD were measured 4 days after electroporation. Results were obtained from 6 normal rats and 6 VH rats. In VH rats, electroporation of NR2B-specific siRNA into the pACC significantly decreased the VMR to 20, 40, and 60 mm Hg CRD from 24 ± 3, 43 ± 5, and 58 ± 4 contractions/5 s in the control siRNA group to 10 ± 1, 25 ± 4, and 40 ± 3 contractions/5 s in NR2B siRNA-injected rats. The mean amplitudes expressed as AUC are shown in Figure 8 . Administration of NR2B siRNA produced a 58%, 42%, and 31% inhibition of VMR to 20, 40, and 60 mm Hg CRD, respectively. However, pACC electroporation of NR2B siRNA in normal rats had no significant effect on the VMR to all CRD pressures. Considered together, this suggests that activation of NR2B in the pACC plays a critical role in the mediation of visceral hyperalgesia in VH rats.  Effects of NMDA receptor antagonists on pACC neuronal activation evoked by CRD in normal and VH rats A total of 25 control rats and 69 neurons were examined for their responses to CRD (50 mm Hg). Spontaneous activity was sufficiently stable to permit recording for 45–70 min. Among the 69 neurons, 18 neurons (26%) exhibited an excitatory response characterized by increased spike firing from baseline (7.0 ± 0.5 to 16.0 ± 1.0 impulses/10 s). These 18 neurons were referred to as CRD-excited neurons. Seven of 69 neurons were inhibited by 50 mm Hg CRD; their spontaneous activity was reduced to 0.35 ± 0.05 impulses/10 s. All 18 CRD-excited neurons were examined for the effects of the two glutamate antagonists on pACC neuronal responses to CRD. One dose of antagonist was applied to each CRD-excited pACC neuron. Microdialysis of vehicle (ACSF, 2 ?L/min) had no effect on pACC neuronal firing. Application of NR2A receptor antagonist NVP-AAM077 or NR2B receptor antagonist Ro25-6981 at concentrations of 100 ?mol/L and 500 ?mol/L did not change spontaneous firing. Intra-pACC administration of either receptor antagonist also had no effect on 50 mm Hg CRD-evoked pACC neuronal responses ( Fig. 1 A , 1 B ). In a separate study, 94 neurons from 31 VH rats were evaluated. Of these 94 neurons, 36 neurons (38%) were excited by 50 mm Hg CRD.

The mean amplitude of the electromyogram (area under the curve [AUC], ?V/s) is shown in Figure 3 . These results are consistent with enhanced visceral pain responses (i.e., hyperalgesia) in EA rats. 3 The specific NR2A subunit antagonist NVP-AAM077 and the specific NR2B subunit antagonist Ro25-6981 were microinjected into the pACC. A total of 12 normal rats and 13 EA rats were studied. Histological studies confirmed the accuracy of the microinjection sites in all but 2 normal rats and 1 EA rat. Hence, VMR data from 10 normal rats and 12 EA rats were analyzed. Several examples of the pACC injection sites are shown in Figure 4 . Microinjection of either NVP-AAM077 (1 and 10 mmol/L) or Ro25-6981 (1 and 10 mmol/L) 11 – 13 into the pACC (areas 24b, 24a, and 32) did not change the VMR to graded-pressure CRD in normal rats ( Fig. 3 ). These results suggest that the pACC neuronal network is not involved in the mediation of visceral pain responses in normal rats, confirming our previous investigations. 7 In EA rats, NVP-AAM077 had no effect on the VMR ( Fig. 3 B ), whereas Ro25-6981 dose-dependently decreased the VMR to CRD ( Fig. 3 A ). In response to graded CRD pressures of 20, 40, and 60 mm Hg, Ro25-6981 (1 mmol/L) reduced the number of muscle contractions from 25 ± 3, 43 ± 2, and 57 ± 6 contractions/5 s to 15 ± 2, 32 ± 4, and 46 ± 3 contractions/5 s, respectively, representing 40%, 26%, and 20% inhibition.

The increase in NR2B expression was time dependent. The increased expression was maintained at 4 weeks after colonic anaphylaxis, but at 6 weeks the NR2B protein level was similar to that in saline-injected rats (data not shown).

Effects of NR2B siRNA on the CRD-evoked VMRs in normal and VH rats Western blots were performed to confirm the effectiveness, specificity, and time course of RNA interference (RNAi)-induced gene silencing by electroporation of NR2B siRNA ( Fig. 6 ). Immunohistochemistry showed GFP expression and a lack of NR2B expression in the pACC after NR2B siRNA administration ( Fig. 7 A , 7 B ). Examples of electroporation sites in 3 rats are shown in Figures 7 C , 7 D , and 7 E . Guided by the data from the Western blot analysis and the recovery time of the animals, VMRs to graded-pressure CRD were measured 4 days after electroporation. Results were obtained from 6 normal rats and 6 VH rats. In VH rats, electroporation of NR2B-specific siRNA into the pACC significantly decreased the VMR to 20, 40, and 60 mm Hg CRD from 24 ± 3, 43 ± 5, and 58 ± 4 contractions/5 s in the control siRNA group to 10 ± 1, 25 ± 4, and 40 ± 3 contractions/5 s in NR2B siRNA-injected rats. The mean amplitudes expressed as AUC are shown in Figure 8 . Administration of NR2B siRNA produced a 58%, 42%, and 31% inhibition of VMR to 20, 40, and 60 mm Hg CRD, respectively.

Discussion In this study, we demonstrated the up-regulation of ACC NR2B-containing NMDA receptors in VH rats. The increase in NR2B receptor expression in the pACC contributes to enhanced responses of pACC neurons to CRD. Blocking NR2A receptors with NVP-AAM077 did not affect the background activity or the CRD-induced response in either normal or VH rats. Further, reverse microdialysis of the NR2B antagonist Ro25-6981 had no effect on basal or stimulated pACC neuronal firing in normal rats. In VH rats, however, Ro25-6981 significantly inhibited the enhanced background activity and abolished the pACC response to CRD. Thus, in VH rats, synaptic transmission in the pACC neurons was enhanced, and this enhancement was mediated mainly by activation of NR2B subtypes of NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors undergo plastic changes in physiological or pathological conditions. 9 , 25 The changes in NMDA receptor subunit composition may also have consequences for activity-dependent plasticity. Previous research has shown that transgenic overexpression of NMDA NR2B receptors in the forebrain increases behavioral responses to persistent inflammatory pain. 11 In the current study, we demonstrated that in the VH rat model, colonic anaphylaxis leads to up-regulation of NR2B receptors in the pACC region. Western blot analysis showed that the level of NR2B expression in the pACC was significantly increased at 10 and 20 days after induction of visceral hypersensitivity. The increase in NR2B expression was time dependent and unit specific. The increase in NR2B protein level was maintained up to 4 wk and returned to basal level at 6 wk after the induction of visceral hypersensitivity. We did not see any significant increases in NR1 and NR2A at 10 and 20 days after induction of visceral hypersensitivity. Furthermore, there were no significant increases in NR2B expression in the hippocampus of the same animals (data not shown). How does the increase in NR2B receptors in the pACC influence neuronal activity? NR1 is reportedly synthesized in considerable excess (estimated to be 10-fold) compared with NR2, as one pool of NR1 was not assembled with NR2 and showed rapid degradation. 26 In our study, we observed the selective up-regulation of NR2B but not NR1 in VH rats. It is conceivable that the up-regulated NR2B can form functional NMDA receptors with the excessive amount of NR1. Moreover, NR2B overexpression may affect NMDA receptor internalization and stability in the synapses of pACC neurons. 27 Our behavioral studies using the NR2B receptor antagonist Ro25-6981 showed that local inhibition of NR2B in the pACC (areas 24b, 24a, and 32) 2 produced a significant reduction in allodynia and hyperalgesia in VH rats. The concentrations of drugs used in this study were higher than the IC50 value for inhibition of NR2B-containing receptors. This is a general technical problem in microinjection studies because the local concentration and diffusion of drugs are difficult to quantify. Our pharmacological observations were further confirmed with studies to silence the gene expression of NR2B. In experimental vertebrate models, RNAi has been successfully applied to target gene expression in organ systems such as liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and pancreas via systemic delivery. 28 , 29 In this study, to down-regulate the gene expression of NR2B in VH rats, we administered NR2B-specific siRNA and plasmid pEGFP-N1 carrying the GFP gene into the pACC by electroporation. The success in knocking down the target genes was validated by Western blot analysis. NR2B siRNA-treated rats showed a mean 72% reduction in the VMR to graded-pressure CRD in the VH rats compared to control. Our observations suggest a role for the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor in neuropathological visceral pain processes and support the notion that the NR2B receptor is an important molecular target for therapeutic agents in the treatment of visceral pain. Ro25-6981 is an ifenprodil derivative and both ifenprodil and Ro25-6981 show selective interaction with the NR2B subunit. 30 , 31 Compared to ifenprodil, Ro25-6981 possesses greatly improved selectivity and affinity towards the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor and shows relatively low affinity to ?1-adrenergic as well as serotonergic binding sites. 31 , 32 Moreover, Ro25-6981 is more than 5000-fold more selective for the heteromeric NR1/NR2B receptors than the NR1/NR2A receptors. 30 Analysis of the distribution of [3H]Ro25-6981 binding in the central nervous system shows a restricted localization pattern similar to that of the NR2B subunit. 31 Although these receptors are functional on spinal dorsal horn neurons, there are indications that supraspinal structures may be involved in ifenprodil-induced anti-nociception. 32 Our studies further support the therapeutic potential of NR2B receptor antagonists such as Ro25-6981 in treating disorders involving visceral hypersensitivity. We conclude that up-regulation and activation of ACC NR2B-containing NMDA receptors play a critical role in ACC sensitization and mediate hyperalgesia in the viscerally hypersensitive state.  Discussion In this study, we demonstrated the up-regulation of ACC NR2B-containing NMDA receptors in VH rats. The increase in NR2B receptor expression in the pACC contributes to enhanced responses of pACC neurons to CRD. Blocking NR2A receptors with NVP-AAM077 did not affect the background activity or the CRD-induced response in either normal or VH rats. Further, reverse microdialysis of the NR2B antagonist Ro25-6981 had no effect on basal or stimulated pACC neuronal firing in normal rats. In VH rats, however, Ro25-6981 significantly inhibited the enhanced background activity and abolished the pACC response to CRD. Thus, in VH rats, synaptic transmission in the pACC neurons was enhanced, and this enhancement was mediated mainly by activation of NR2B subtypes of NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors undergo plastic changes in physiological or pathological conditions. 9 , 25 The changes in NMDA receptor subunit composition may also have consequences for activity-dependent plasticity. Previous research has shown that transgenic overexpression of NMDA NR2B receptors in the forebrain increases behavioral responses to persistent inflammatory pain. 11 In the current study, we demonstrated that in the VH rat model, colonic anaphylaxis leads to up-regulation of NR2B receptors in the pACC region. Western blot analysis showed that the level of NR2B expression in the pACC was significantly increased at 10 and 20 days after induction of visceral hypersensitivity. The increase in NR2B expression was time dependent and unit specific. The increase in NR2B protein level was maintained up to 4 wk and returned to basal level at 6 wk after the induction of visceral hypersensitivity. We did not see any significant increases in NR1 and NR2A at 10 and 20 days after induction of visceral hypersensitivity. Furthermore, there were no significant increases in NR2B expression in the hippocampus of the same animals (data not shown). How does the increase in NR2B receptors in the pACC influence neuronal activity? NR1 is reportedly synthesized in considerable excess (estimated to be 10-fold) compared with NR2, as one pool of NR1 was not assembled with NR2 and showed rapid degradation. 26 In our study, we observed the selective up-regulation of NR2B but not NR1 in VH rats. It is conceivable that the up-regulated NR2B can form functional NMDA receptors with the excessive amount of NR1. Moreover, NR2B overexpression may affect NMDA receptor internalization and stability in the synapses of pACC neurons. 27 Our behavioral studies using the NR2B receptor antagonist Ro25-6981 showed that local inhibition of NR2B in the pACC (areas 24b, 24a, and 32) 2 produced a significant reduction in allodynia and hyperalgesia in VH rats. The concentrations of drugs used in this study were higher than the IC50 value for inhibition of NR2B-containing receptors. This is a general technical problem in microinjection studies because the local concentration and diffusion of drugs are difficult to quantify. Our pharmacological observations were further confirmed with studies to silence the gene expression of NR2B. In experimental vertebrate models, RNAi has been successfully applied to target gene expression in organ systems such as liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and pancreas via systemic delivery. 28 , 29 In this study, to down-regulate the gene expression of NR2B in VH rats, we administered NR2B-specific siRNA and plasmid pEGFP-N1 carrying the GFP gene into the pACC by electroporation. The success in knocking down the target genes was validated by Western blot analysis. NR2B siRNA-treated rats showed a mean 72% reduction in the VMR to graded-pressure CRD in the VH rats compared to control. Our observations suggest a role for the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor in neuropathological visceral pain processes and support the notion that the NR2B receptor is an important molecular target for therapeutic agents in the treatment of visceral pain. Ro25-6981 is an ifenprodil derivative and both ifenprodil and Ro25-6981 show selective interaction with the NR2B subunit. 30 , 31 Compared to ifenprodil, Ro25-6981 possesses greatly improved selectivity and affinity towards the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor and shows relatively low affinity to ?1-adrenergic as well as serotonergic binding sites. 31 , 32 Moreover, Ro25-6981 is more than 5000-fold more selective for the heteromeric NR1/NR2B receptors than the NR1/NR2A receptors. 30 Analysis of the distribution of [3H]Ro25-6981 binding in the central nervous system shows a restricted localization pattern similar to that of the NR2B subunit. 31 Although these receptors are functional on spinal dorsal horn neurons, there are indications that supraspinal structures may be involved in ifenprodil-induced anti-nociception. 32 Our studies further support the therapeutic potential of NR2B receptor antagonists such as Ro25-6981 in treating disorders involving visceral hypersensitivity.
