The role of HER2 in early breast cancer metastasis and the origins of resistance to HER2-targeted therapies The HER2 gene encodes the receptor tyrosine kinase HER2 and is often over-expressed or amplified in breast cancer. Up-regulation of HER2 contributes to tumor progression. Many aspects of tumor growth are favorably affected through activation of HER2 signaling. Indeed, HER2 plays a role in increasing proliferation and survival of the primary tumor and distant lesions which upon completion of full transformation cause metastases. P185HER2/neu receptors and signaling from them and associated molecules lead to increase motility of both intravasating and extravasating cells, decreasing apoptosis, enhancing signaling interactions with the microenvironment, regulating adhesion, as well as a multitude of other functions. Recent experimental and clinical evidence supports the view that spread of incompletely transformed cells occurs at a very early stage in tumor progression. This review concerns the identification and characterization of HER2, the evolution of the metastasis model, and the more recent cancer stem cell model. In particular, we review the evidence for an emerging mechanism of HER2+ breast cancer progression, whereby the untransformed HER2-expressing cell shows characteristics of stem/progenitor cell, metastasizes, and then completes its final transformation at the secondary site.  Conclusion Metastasis can occur very early during breast cancer progression and exist in different locations with an incompletely transformed phenotype. Despite complete removal of their primary tumor, patients with localized, lymph node-negative tumors also relapse, demonstrating that disseminated tumor cells must have spread before surgery or even diagnosis. Recent studies have found breast tumor cells have cancer stem cell properties and are regulated by HER2. HER2 is responsible for an increase in proliferation and survival of the primary tumor and also plays a role in the distant but not completely transformed lesions. An increase in motility of intravasating and extravasating cells, a decrease in apoptosis, an enhancement of communication with the microenvironment, and regulation of adhesion alters these distantly migrated cells. HER2 over-expression enhances the transformation potential. Current understanding of how untransformed, stem/progenitor cell-like, HER2-expressing cells metastasize and how they could be therapeutically targeted to prevent HER2+ breast cancer progression should lead to new treatment schedules of targeted antibodies which are directed at incompletely transformed cells.
