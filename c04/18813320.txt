Basal cell carcinomas: attack of the hedgehog Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) were essentially a molecular ‘black box’ until some 12 years ago, when identification of a genetic flaw in a rare subset of patients who have a great propensity to develop BCCs pointed to aberrant Hedgehog signalling as the pivotal defect leading to formation of these tumours. This discovery has facilitated a remarkable increase in our understanding of BCC carcinogenesis and has highlighted the carcinogenic role of this developmental pathway when aberrantly activated in adulthood. Importantly, a phase 1 first-in-human trial of a Hedgehog inhibitor has shown real progress in halting and even reversing the growth of these tumours.  Conclusions In little more than one decade, thanks to the work of many investigators, our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of BCCs has gone from close to zero to a fairly significant body of information. Certainly, we still have only a rudimentary knowledge of the genetic underpinnings that determine which people develop BCCs and which do not, and of the wiring that drives keratinocytes to BCC carcinogenesis. But it does seem that we already have enough information to have a reasonable chance of translating our molecular understanding to real clinical benefit. The successful molecularly targeted treatment of BCCs with HHI might be only the first of the clinical benefits that result from the vanquishing of the evil hedgehog.
