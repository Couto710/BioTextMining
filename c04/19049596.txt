Ketone bodies, glycolysis, and K ATP channels in the mechanism of the ketogenic diet Summary The ketogenic diet (KD) has shown remarkable efficacy in the treatment of drug-resistant childhood epilepsy. Our understanding of how the KD produces its anticonvulsant and anti-epileptogenic effects remains incomplete, which is perhaps not surprising for a biological manipulation as sweeping as dietary change. Several hypotheses focus on ketone bodies, fuel molecules that circulate at millimolar concentrations in the blood of patients on a KD, as causative agents. Here I consider some recent evidence for one such hypothesis, involving a possible role for altered glycolysis and consequent activation of a class of potassium channels called KATP channels.
