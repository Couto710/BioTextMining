Evolutionary adaptation to high altitude: a view from in utero A primary focus within biological anthropology has been to elucidate the processes of evolutionary adaptation. A. Roberto Frisancho helped move anthropology towards more mechanistic explanations of human adaptation by drawing attention to the importance of the functional relevance of human variation. Using the natural laboratory of high altitude, he and others asked whether the unique physiology of indigenous high-altitude residents was the result of acclimatization, developmental plasticity and/or genetic adaptation in response to the high-altitude environment. We approach the question of human adaptation to high altitude from a somewhat unique vantage point; namely, by examining physiological characteristics – pregnancy and pregnancy outcome -- that are most closely associated with reproductive fitness. Here we review the potent example of high-altitude native population’s resistance to hypoxia-associated reductions in birth weight, which is often associated with higher infant morbidity and mortality at high altitude. With the exception of two recent publications, these comparative birth weight studies have utilized surnames, self-identification and/or linguistic characteristics to assess ancestry, and none have linked ‘advantageous’ phenotypes to specific genetic variations. Recent advancements in genetic and statistical tools have enabled us to assess individual ancestry with higher resolution, identify the genetic basis of complex phenotypes and to infer the effect of natural selection on specific gene regions. Using these technologies our studies are now directed to determine the genetic variations that underlie the mechanisms by which high-altitude ancestry protects fetal growth and, in turn, to further our understanding of evolutionary processes involved in human adaptation to high altitude.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Research efforts over the past 50 years have clearly demonstrated that differences in birth weight and pregnancy outcome exist between populations at high altitude, and that multigenerational high-altitude ancestry exerts a strong, protective influence. Moreover, a vast number of physiological studies demonstrate that increased uterine artery blood flow is a plausible mechanism by which high-altitude ancestry protects fetal growth. Although several factors confound our ability to determine whether it truly reduces reproductive fitness and hence is a maladaptive response at high altitude, it is clear that reduced birth weight impairs reproductive success at low altitude and, in general, both neonatal mortality and morbidity are worse for lower than normal birth-weight babies at high altitude and worse in comparison with low altitude. Since natural selection ultimately acts via systematic variations in reproductive fitness, we consider that the differences in birth weight, neonatal morbidity and mortality observed between migrant and native high altitude populations strongly support the concept that protected fetal growth at high altitude is the result of genetic adaptation. Additional studies and new approaches to the question as to whether reduced fetal size is being selected against or for at high altitude are needed as well as the application of new genomic technologies for identifying the gene regions involved are greatly needed. Comparative physiological studies have enabled us to identify not only phenotypic differences between populations but also to elucidate the mechanisms by which the phenotypic variation arises and to highlight possible gene candidates for future investigation. Only in recent years has it become possible to examine genetic variation and individual ancestry with high resolution, to identify specific gene regions that are likely to have been acted upon by natural selection, or to begin to address the genetic components of complex phenotypes. As such, our current and future studies are designed to combine the strengths of comparative physiological studies during pregnancy and during the perinatal period with emerging genetic technologies in order to determine the genes involved in protecting long-resident groups from altitude-associated reductions in fetal growth and, in turn, the processes underlying human genetic adaptation to high altitude.
