Maximizing resources to study an uncommon cancer: E2C2 -- Epidemiology of Endometrial Cancer Consortium  Conclusion Progress on planned and ongoing projects within E2C2 reflects the interest and enthusiasm of the investigators and the recognition that combining results from individual studies provides a powerful method for answering etiologic questions that cannot be addressed otherwise. E2C2 has provided an infrastructure for investigators to work together to address questions of etiology of this disease and eventually to identify preventive measures. In the future, collaborations established through this resource can be used to address methodological issues such as optimal methods for data collection, management and pooling, and questions related to survivorship. In addition, establishment of a consortium allows for collaboration among investigators with similar interests and exchange of ideas, hypotheses, and methodologies that can benefit future research in this disease.
