The National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire in the Macular Telangiectasia (MacTel) Project Purpose To describe vision-targeted health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), measured with the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) in a cohort of patients with macular telangiectasia (MacTel) type 2 and to evaluate the relationship between visual acuity and NEI-VFQ-25 scores. Methods This was an analysis of cross-sectional baseline data from a longitudinal natural history study. Patients with MacTel type 2 were enrolled in the Natural History Study of The Macular Telangiectasia Project (The MacTel Project). NEI-VFQ-25 were completed at enrollment. Linear correlation and regression analyses were used to relate baseline NEI-VFQ-25 overall and subscale scores to visual acuity. Results Participants reported lower vision-related functioning measured by the NEI-VFQ-25 in most of the domains measured by the NEI VFQ compared with that of a normal reference group ( P < 0.001 for all domains except color vision). Visual acuity was found to be associated with the NEI-VFQ-25 in many of the domains measuring degree of difficulty with common visual activities. Conclusions This is the first cross-sectional cohort study to assess vision targeted HR-QOL in patients with MacTel type 2. Patients with MacTel type 2 reported markedly reduced visual functioning compared to reports of a normal reference group. These findings provide support to the use of the NEI-VFQ-25 in patients with MacTel type 2 to measure the effect of disease and potential therapies on vision-targeted HR-QOL.

Methods Design and Procedures We studied patients with MacTel Type 2 who were enrolled in the MacTel Project’s Natural History Study, a multicenter observational study conducted in 22 clinical centers in seven countries. Each center was granted approval to conduct the study by their institutional review board or independent ethics committee. The eligibility criteria for the study required the participant be at least 18 years of age with a diagnosis of MacTel type 2 made clinically at each clinical center and confirmed on fundus photographs, ocular coherence tomography, fluorescein angiographs, or autofluorescence image gradings performed by the Fundus Reading Center of Moorfields Eye Hospital. A total of 243 participants were enrolled in the study between November 17, 2005, and January 15, 2007. After signing the informed consent, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, each participant had a comprehensive dilated ophthalmic examination and completed a health and family history interview. Best corrected visual acuity 19 was measured by trained examiners using a standardized protocol and Early Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity charts. 20 , 21 At the baseline visits, the 25-item NEI-VFQ-25 ( http://www.rand.org/health/surveys_tools/vfq/ ) was administered to participants by the clinical center coordinator. The NEI-VFQ-25 is the short form of the NEI-VFQ Field Test Version that was developed to include general health, general vision, ocular pain, near vision activities, distance vision activities, social functioning, vision-specific role difficulties, vision-specific mental health, dependency because of vision, driving, peripheral vision, and color vision. 9 Item responses were transformed to a scale of 0 to 100. The overall NEI-VFQ-25 score was calculated as the average of the 25 items, whereas the subscale scores were the averages of the responses to items within each subscale. Both the overall and subscale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better vision-targeted HR-QOL. Statistical Methods Demographic and visual acuity characteristics for participants were summarized with descriptive statistics. The NEI-VFQ-25 subscale scores were computed according to published algorithms. 8 A mean (SD) for the overall NEI-VFQ-25 and for each subscale was computed. The subscale means were compared with those of a reference group of 122 normal subjects derived from the field test of the NEI-VFQ-25. 9 The relation of visual acuity to vision-targeted HR-QOL was evaluated by assessing the magnitude of Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients 22 between the better eye and worse eye visual acuity and the scores from the NEI-VFQ-25. Associations of visual acuity and vision-targeted HR-QOL were also evaluated by comparing the age, sex, and disease type (nonproliferative versus proliferative disease) adjusted mean differences in scores within ordered visual acuity categories (20/32 or better in both eyes, worse than 20/32 in one eye, or worse than 20/32 in both eyes) using a test of trend. The Dunnett multiple-comparisons test 23 was used to identify significant differences in scores within the visual acuity categories by comparing each level with the reference level (20/32 or better in both eyes). Tests for trend in the linear models were performed by using linear contrasts. Internal consistency and reliability were assessed with Cronbach’s ? 24 for the eight multi-item subscales of the 25-item NEI-VFQ. All analyses were performed with commercially available statistical software (SAS, ver. 8.02; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

All analyses were performed with commercially available statistical software (SAS, ver. 8.02; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  Results Two hundred twenty-two (91%) of 243 participants enrolled in the Natural History Study completed the baseline 25-item NEI-VFQ and are included in this report. Twenty-one participants were excluded from the analysis because they did not have a confirmatory diagnosis of MacTel type 2 by the Reading Center. A summary of the baseline characteristics is provided in Table 1 . The mean (± SD) age of the population was 61 (±9) years (range, 36–83 years) at the time the questionnaire was administered. Approximately 60% of the participants were women and 88% were Caucasian. According to letter scores, the mean visual acuity for the better eye of the participants was 75 (±11) letters (Snellen equivalent, ~20/32). Thirteen percent of the participants had proliferative disease defined as neovascularization, as detected on fundus photographs or OCT, or receiving treatment specifically for neovascularization. Fifty-one participants (23%) had received treatment for MacTel type 2. The mean duration of disease in the population was 3.7 (±4.3) years. The mean visual acuity of the worse eye was 61 (±17) letters (Snellen equivalent, ~20/62.5). Forty percent of the participants had visual acuity worse than 20/32 OU at the time the questionnaire was administered. Mean (SD) and median baseline NEI-VFQ-25 scores, proportions of participants with a perfect score (100 points, ceiling) and with the lowest possible score (0 points, floor), and internal consistency estimates for the eight subscales with multiple items are presented in Table 2 . The mean overall score on the NEI-VFQ-25 was 77, with a median of 80. The median score was less than 85 on half of the subscales (general health, general vision, near activities, distance activities, mental health, and role difficulties). Some of the subscales, in particular the ocular pain, social functioning, dependency, color vision and peripheral vision, had large ceiling effects where a substantial percentage of participants (>25%) had the highest possible scores, whereas very few participants had subscale scores of 0. The internal consistency estimates for the NEI-VFQ-25 subscales as measured by Cronbach’s ?, ranged from 0.48 to 0.79. With the exception of ocular pain and driving (Cronbach’s ? = 0.66 and 0.48, respectively), the subscales had similar internal consistency estimates as those found by the developers 9 (Cronbach’s ? ? 0.70 for all the eight multi-item subscales). The six of eight subscales with Cronbach’s ? ? 0.70 demonstrated a moderately strong internal consistency and reliability within this cohort of patients with MacTel type 2. To develop a shorter version of the NEI-VFQ-51 item questionnaire consisting of 25 questions, researchers tested participants with various eye diseases and a control/reference group free of eye disease. Mean subscale scores from the MacTel type 2 cohort were compared with those of the reference group. 8 Subscale NEI-VFQ-25 scores were markedly lower in patients with MacTel type 2 than in the reference group from the NEI-VFQ-25 field test ( Fig. 1 ). More specifically, mean scores of patients with MacTel type 2 from five subscales including role difficulties, mental health, near vision, and distance vision, were ~20 points below the mean scores of the reference group. Similar mean scores between the reference and MacTel type 2 groups were apparent in only the color vision subscales (98 vs. 97). All differences, except for color vision, were statistically significant ( P < 0.001). Rank correlations between the NEI-VFQ-25 subscale scores and best and worse visual acuity are provided in Table 3 . Correlations ranged from small (0.14) to moderate (0.38), except for the ocular pain subscale, which showed a negligible correlation (0.04). Correlations with visual acuity in the better eye and scores on the NEI-VFQ-25 were statistically significant ( P < 0.01) for all NEI-VFQ-25 subscales except ocular pain and mental health. Moderate correlations corresponded to subscales, such as general vision, near activities, distance activities, and driving, which measure the degree of difficulty with common visual activities. The correlations of NEI-VFQ-25 overall and subscale scores with visual acuity of the worse eye were similar to those with the visual acuity of the better eye, probably because MacTel type 2 is a bilateral disease. Mean NEI-VFQ-25 subscale scores by participants’ age, sex, race, and disease type were computed (data not shown). Univariate analyses showed that the mean overall NEI-VFQ-25 score of older participants was significantly higher than that of younger participants. The older age groups (?70 years) had significantly higher scores on average than did the younger age group (?55 years) on the subscales relating to near activities, distance activities, mental health, role difficulties, and dependency. This result, showing higher NEI-VFQ-25 scores in older persons with MacTel type 2, differs from that found for other cohorts in which the mean overall NEI-VFQ-25 score was found to be significantly lower in persons who were older. 10 , 13 The distribution of visual acuity in the worse and better eyes did not show the same phenomenon. The visual acuity in the better eye in the younger and older age groups did not differ (74 letters vs. 73 letters, respectively). In addition, the visual acuity in the worse eye in the two age groups did not differ (61 letters vs. 60 letters, respectively). The mean overall NEI-VFQ-25 score differed significantly by sex, with the men having a significantly higher mean score than did the females (81 vs. 75). In addition, the men had higher mean scores on the near activity (76 vs. 65), distance activity (82 vs. 72), mental health (75 vs. 66), dependency (92 vs. 85), driving (83 vs. 66), and peripheral vision (90 vs. 83) subscales. The mean overall NEI-VFQ-25 score differed significantly by disease type. Participants with proliferative disease had a significantly lower mean score than did participants with nonproliferative disease (67 vs. 79). In addition, participants with proliferative disease had significantly lower mean scores on all subscales except general health, ocular pain, color vision, and peripheral vision. Caucasian participants had a higher, yet not significant, mean overall NEI-VFQ-25 score than did non-Caucasians (78 vs. 73, respectively; P = 0.034). Caucasians had significantly higher scores than did non-Caucasians on subscales relating to distant activities (77 vs. 67), social functioning (94 vs. 88), and peripheral vision (87 vs. 76). Participants treated for MacTel type 2 had significantly lower social functioning subscale scores than did participants not treated for MacTel type 2 (88 vs. 94), whereas there was a significant linear relationship between duration of disease and NEI-VFQ-25 score for the near activities and role difficulties (data not shown). The near activities score for participants newly diagnosed with MacTel type 2 at enrollment (duration equal to 0 years) was 73 compared with 76 in participants with a duration of disease equal to 3 years before enrollment, whereas the role difficulties score of participants newly diagnosed with MacTel type 2 at enrollment was 75 compared with 79 in participants with a duration of disease equal to 3 years before enrollment (data not shown). The overall mean NEI-VFQ-25 score and subscale scores were compared across sites located in North America (United States), Europe (Germany, France, and the United Kingdom), Israel, India, and Australia (data not shown). There was no significant difference in the overall NEI-VFQ-25 mean score and only the mean scores from the general health and mental health subscales were found to be significantly different across the five regions ( P < 0.01). The NEI-VFQ-25 overall and subscale mean scores adjusted for age, sex, race, and disease type are presented in Table 4 . The test for trend indicated a progressive trend ( P < 0.01) toward dysfunction, as reflected by the overall NEI-VFQ-25 score and most of the subscales, between participants with the unilateral and bilateral forms of vision impairment. The differences between the group with vision worse than 20/32 in both eyes and the group with 20/32 or better in both eyes were primarily responsible for this association, as demonstrated by the significant results of the Dunnett multiple comparisons test. Participants with vision worse than 20/32 in at least 1 eye had moderately lower scores (yet did not reach statistical significance) for the overall NEI-VFQ-25 and all subscales except ocular pain compared with participants with vision 20/32 or better in both eyes. Scores of participants with vision worse than 20/32 in both eyes were markedly lower ( P < 0.01) on the overall NEI-VFQ-25 and the general vision, near activity, dependency, and driving subscales compared with participants with vision 20/32 or better in both eyes. Participants with worse than 20/32 vision in both eyes reported the most difficulty (mean score ?70 and significantly different from the reference mean) with general vision, near activities, and driving. Scores for participants with vision worse than 20/32 in both eyes remained significantly lower after further adjustment for treatment for MacTel type 2 and duration of disease for the overall score and the general vision, near activities, dependency, and driving subscales. Table 5 provides the mean NEI-VFQ-25 subscale scores for MacTel type 2 patients for comparison with published scores for other cohorts of patients with eye diseases. 9 , 10 , 15 , 18 The mean age, percentage who were women, and the mean visual acuity in the better eye are provided if available within the cited publication. NEI-VFQ-25 subscale scores for this cohort of patients with MacTel type 2 are similar to those found for participants with preoperative age-related cataract (column F, Table 5 ). For most subscales, patients with MacTel type 2 had worse scores than those of patients with acute optic neuritis, early age-related macular degeneration in the Complications of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Prevention Trial (CAPT), 12 glaucoma, cytomegalovirus retinitis, and dry eye (columns A, B, E, G, H, Table 5 ). The last column of Table 5 provides a ranking of the MacTel type 2 mean subscale scores (from worse score to better score) among mean scores from other cohorts with various eye diseases. On most subscales, the patients with MacTel type 2 had scores that ranked within one, two, or three steps from the worst score. This may be because MacTel type 2 is one of the few clinical retinal diagnoses in which visual impairment is usually present in both eyes and thus reflects a reduced vision-related quality of life.  Results Two hundred twenty-two (91%) of 243 participants enrolled in the Natural History Study completed the baseline 25-item NEI-VFQ and are included in this report.

This may be because MacTel type 2 is one of the few clinical retinal diagnoses in which visual impairment is usually present in both eyes and thus reflects a reduced vision-related quality of life.  Discussion This report provides the first data regarding vision-targeted HR-QOL collected using a standard instrument for patients with MacTel type 2. Significant correlation coefficients were found between most of the NEI-VFQ-25 subscale scores and visual acuity. It was also shown that the NEI-VFQ-25 showed moderately strong internal consistency within the MacTel cohort. This demonstrates that the NEI-VFQ-25 is sensitive to the effect of MacTel type 2 and supports the construct validity of the questionnaire. Further evidence of the validity of the questionnaire within this cohort is provided by the decrease in the overall score and several subscale scores with the progressive degrees of visual impairment. Vision-targeted HR-QOL mean subscale scores assessed with the NEI-VFQ-25 were lower compared with the reference group free from eye disease. Furthermore, compared with other cohorts with AMD and diabetic retinopathy, the MacTel cohort showed lower mean scores for most subscales and ranked among the lowest scores across other cohorts with various eye diseases. This result is consistent with the impression of study investigators that MacTel type 2 has a significant impact on visual functioning, in particular vision-targeted HR-QOL, even when visual acuity is only modestly impaired. A plausible explanation for this is that the most markedly affected region of the macula is not the fovea, but rather the inferotemporal perifoveal zone. 25 The results of this study confirm results in previous studies of cohorts with eye disease that showed the influence of visual function on vision-targeted HR-QOL. 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 18 However, relationships between mean NEI-VFQ-25 scores and demographics in the MacTel cohort revealed some results not demonstrated in other studies–for example, the linear relationship between the MacTel cohort’s age and NEI-VFQ-25 mean scores. Age was not associated with previous treatment or whether the disease was the proliferative type (data not shown). A significantly higher percentage of men were in the older age group and had higher scores than did the women. This difference may be one explanation for the higher scores in the older cohort, yet it is important to note that the linear relationship between MacTel cohort’s age and NEI-VFQ-25 mean scores remained after adjustment for sex and other covariates. Previous studies have reported lower scores in older individuals than in younger ones. 11 , 14 , 26 The previous studies consisted of participants with age-related macular degeneration and type I diabetes and had similar proportions of women. All mean subscale scores except for color vision were higher in the AMD and diabetes cohorts than in participants with MacTel type 2. Participants with MacTel type 2 were on average younger but had a lower mean visual acuity in both the better and worse eye than did the AMD cohort. Correlations between visual acuity and subscale scores were lower in the MacTel cohort than were correlations found in the other studies. The mean overall NEI-VFQ-25 score was found to be significantly higher in the men than in the women with MacTel type 2. Other studies have found no differences in the overall composite mean score among the men and the women. 11 , 14 , 26 As mentioned previously, participants with MacTel type 2 were enrolled from seven countries, another difference from other studies reporting NEI-VFQ-25 results in participants with eye diseases. The studies we looked at enrolled only participants from a single country or region. 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 26 This study has some limitations. We did not compare the results with a similarly collected control group, because the objective of this MacTel Project is to evaluate the clinical features and natural history of the disease in patients with MacTel type 2. Although differences in the normal control subjects and our cohort may have an influence on the results, we believe this unlikely given the large differences found between our cohort and the field test reference group. It is important to note that the ranking of MacTel type 2 NEI-VFQ-25 scores in Table 5 compared with other ocular conditions did not take into account known and unknown confounders. Therefore, some caution should be used in interpreting the relative rankings. In summary, these results show that MacTel type 2 is associated with significant reductions in vision-targeted HR-QOL and may also signify that these reductions are more severe than in cohorts with other eye diseases with similar levels of visual acuity. This study confirms clinical observations from the MacTel Project that MacTel type 2 has a significant effect on vision-specific HR-QOL.  Discussion This report provides the first data regarding vision-targeted HR-QOL collected using a standard instrument for patients with MacTel type 2. Significant correlation coefficients were found between most of the NEI-VFQ-25 subscale scores and visual acuity. It was also shown that the NEI-VFQ-25 showed moderately strong internal consistency within the MacTel cohort. This demonstrates that the NEI-VFQ-25 is sensitive to the effect of MacTel type 2 and supports the construct validity of the questionnaire. Further evidence of the validity of the questionnaire within this cohort is provided by the decrease in the overall score and several subscale scores with the progressive degrees of visual impairment. Vision-targeted HR-QOL mean subscale scores assessed with the NEI-VFQ-25 were lower compared with the reference group free from eye disease. Furthermore, compared with other cohorts with AMD and diabetic retinopathy, the MacTel cohort showed lower mean scores for most subscales and ranked among the lowest scores across other cohorts with various eye diseases. This result is consistent with the impression of study investigators that MacTel type 2 has a significant impact on visual functioning, in particular vision-targeted HR-QOL, even when visual acuity is only modestly impaired. A plausible explanation for this is that the most markedly affected region of the macula is not the fovea, but rather the inferotemporal perifoveal zone. 25 The results of this study confirm results in previous studies of cohorts with eye disease that showed the influence of visual function on vision-targeted HR-QOL. 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 18 However, relationships between mean NEI-VFQ-25 scores and demographics in the MacTel cohort revealed some results not demonstrated in other studies–for example, the linear relationship between the MacTel cohort’s age and NEI-VFQ-25 mean scores. Age was not associated with previous treatment or whether the disease was the proliferative type (data not shown). A significantly higher percentage of men were in the older age group and had higher scores than did the women. This difference may be one explanation for the higher scores in the older cohort, yet it is important to note that the linear relationship between MacTel cohort’s age and NEI-VFQ-25 mean scores remained after adjustment for sex and other covariates.

Correlations between visual acuity and subscale scores were lower in the MacTel cohort than were correlations found in the other studies. The mean overall NEI-VFQ-25 score was found to be significantly higher in the men than in the women with MacTel type 2.
