Selective Contrast Enhancement of Individual Alzheimer’s Disease Amyloid Plaques Using a Polyamine and Gd-DOTA Conjugated Antibody Fragment Against Fibrillar A ? 42 for Magnetic Resonance Molecular Imaging Purpose The lack of an in vivo diagnostic test for AD has prompted the targeting of amyloid plaques with diagnostic imaging probes. We describe the development of a contrast agent (CA) for magnetic resonance microimaging that utilizes the F(ab?)2 fragment of a monoclonal antibody raised against fibrillar human A?42 Methods This fragment is polyamine modified to enhance its BBB permeability and its ability to bind to amyloid plaques. It is also conjugated with a chelator and gadolinium for subsequent imaging of individual amyloid plaques Results Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated this 125I-CA has higher BBB permeability and lower accumulation in the liver and kidney than F(ab?)2 in WT mice. The CA retains its ability to bind A?40/42 monomers/fibrils and also binds to amyloid plaques in sections of AD mouse brain. Intravenous injection of 125I-CA into the AD mouse demonstrates targeting of amyloid plaques throughout the cortex/hippocampus as detected by emulsion autoradiography. Incubation of AD mouse brain slices in vitro with this CA resulted in selective enhancement on T 1-weighted spin-echo images, which co-register with individual plaques observed on spatially matched T 2-weighted spin-echo image Conclusions Development of such a molecular probe is expected to open new avenues for the diagnosis of AD.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals The in vivo labeling experiments were performed using transgenic mice that express two mutant human proteins associated with familial AD and have been described in detail elsewhere ( 15 ). Hemizygous transgenic mice (Tg2576) expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP695) ( 16 ) were mated with a strain of homozygous transgenic mice (M146L6.2) expressing mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1) ( 15 ). In one experiment, an APP (Tg2576) mouse was used. The animals were genotyped for the expression of both transgenes by a PCR method using a sample of mouse-tail DNA. The mice were housed in a virus-free barrier facility under a 12-h light/dark cycle, with ad libitum access to food and water. All procedures performed were in accordance with NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals using protocols approved by the Mayo Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Preparation of F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 fragments Monoclonal IgG4.1 was developed as described by Poduslo et al. ( 14 ). It is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the first 15 amino acid residues of soluble and fibrillar A?40/42 peptides (unpublished results). Pure F(ab?)24.1 was obtained by digesting IgG4.1 using ficin at pH 6.5. The purification of the F(ab?)24.1 from the digested sample was followed as described previously by Poduslo et al. ( 14 ). Sample purity was evaluated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce Biotechnology). Conjugation of DOTA to F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 The chelating agent 1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA; Strem Chemicals, Newburyport, MA), was coupled to F(ab?)24.1 using the carbodiimide reaction as described by Smith-Jones and Solita ( 17 ). DOTA was preferred over diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA) as the chelating agent due to the higher stability of its gadolinium complex. Conjugation of DOTA to F(ab?)24.1 involved two steps. In the first step, the active ester of DOTA was generated with carbodiimide at pH 7.8. In the second step, the active ester reacted with the amine side chain functional groups of lysine present in F(ab?)24.1. The number of DOTA molecules attached to F(ab?)24.1 was controlled by changing the aliquot concentration of the added active ester, by adjusting the reaction time and controlling the pH. Initially, the reactions were performed by mixing 1 mg of pure F(ab?)24.1 with 80 ?l of freshly prepared active ester, which is prepared using 0.361 mmol of DOTA and 0.313 mmol of N -hydroxy succinimide in 2 ml of metal free distilled water at pH 6.8 as described in Smith Jones and Solita ( 17 ), for different time periods (0.5, 1, 2, 18 h) at room temperature. For the characterization of DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 conjugate, the reaction mixture was concentrated using a 30kDa MWCO centrifugal filter (Vivaspin 20, Vivascience Sartorius group, Hannover, Germany) to about 5 mg/ml and washed (at least 12 times) with equal volumes of 1 M ammonium acetate (metal free) at pH 6.8. The success of this coupling was evaluated by incubating this derivative with an equimolar amount of radioactive gadolinium (153Gd) for subsequent autoradiographic analysis following SDS-PAGE. For the preparation of contrast agent for all other experiments, 1 mg of F(ab?)24.1 was mixed with 120 ?l of fresh active ester and incubated at room temperature for 0.5 h and non-radioactive GdCl3 was used for chelation. The Gd-DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 was further modified with the polyamine, putrescine using the carbodiimide reaction as described previously ( 14 ). SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Isoelectric Focusing (IEF) Aliquots of IgG4.1, pF(ab?)24.1, and Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were run on a SDS-PAGE gel (7.5% T and 1% C ) in the absence of a reducing agent and stained with Coomassie blue using standard methods ( 18 ). IEF of IgG4.1 and pIgG4.1 as well as the F(ab?)24.1 and pF (ab?)24.1 samples were performed using a Bio-Rad Model 111 Mini IEF Cell according to the manufacturer?s instructions. Briefly, 40% Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholyte solution (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California) was used with a polyacrylamide gel (25% T , 0.75% C ). The gels were cast between the acrylic casting tray and gel support film to give a gel dimensions of 125×65×0.4 mm. Monomer ampholyte polymerization time under a fluorescent desk lamp was 45 min. Samples were loaded and allowed to diffuse into the gel for 6 min. IEF was carried out under constant voltage in a stepped fashion: 45 min at 100 V and 15 min at 450 V. Bio-Rad IEF standards containing nine native proteins with isoelectric points ranging from 4.45 to 9.6, as well as albumin (4.7) and cytochrome C (9.6), were run for comparison. All bands were visualized with 0.04% Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain. Estimation of Bound DOTA per F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 Molecule by Paper Chromatography Three 20 ?l aliquots from 10 mg/ml DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 conjugates were mixed with 10, 20, 30 ?l aliquots of 1 mM GdCl3 spiked with a trace amount of radioactive 153Gd. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 16 h and then reincubated at 37°C for another 5 h after the addition of 50 ?l of 5 mM DTPA. Five ?l of sample was spotted onto a 20 cm silica gel impregnated glass fiber chromatography strip (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) and eluted with 5 mM DTPA (pH 6.0). The relative amount of bound Gd per molecule of DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 was determined by cutting the strip to 1 cm wide pieces and counting each of them in a gamma counter. Conjugated Gd-DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 remained at the origin whereas free (Gd- DTPA) moved with the solvent front. The number of DOTA covalently linked per F(ab?)24.1 molecule ( N ) was calculated from the mole ratio between Gd and DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 and from the observed ratio of [Gd-DOTA-F(ab?)24.1] and [Gd-DTPA]: N = Radioactivity at origin ( cpm ) × Gd mole concentration Total radioactivity ( cpm ) × Antibody fragment mole concentration The Gd concentration was further quantified using the mass spectroscopic facility at the University of California, Los Angels using Agilent 7500CC quadrupole inductively coupled mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Plasma Pharmacokinetic Studies After catheterizing the femoral vein and the femoral artery of each mouse under general anesthesia (isoflurane=1.5%; oxygen=4 l/min), 125I-F (ab?)24.1 or 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were administered intravenously in the femoral vein. The plasma pharmacokinetics of these compounds were determined by collecting serial blood samples (20 ?l) from the femoral artery over a period of time. The blood samples were diluted to a volume of 100 ?l with normal saline, centrifuged, and the supernatant was obtained. TCA precipitation was conducted and the supernatants of the samples and the pellets were assayed for 125I radioactivity in a gamma counter (Cobra II, Packard). Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of 125I-F(ab?)24.1 and 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were estimated by nonlinear curve fitting of the experimental data using Gauss-Newton (Levenberg and Hartley) algorithm (WinNonlin® Professional, version 5.2, Mountain view, CA). Secondary parameters such as the C max (maximum plasma concentration), the plasma clearance (CL), volume of distribution, and area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) were also calculated using the WinNonlin® software. The mean parameter values of both compounds were compared by Student’s t -test using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Permeability Measurements of Radioiodinated F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1, pF(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 and Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 at the BBB Aliquots of the proteins were labeled with 125I using the chloramine-T procedure and PS/ V p (PS: permeability coefficientsurface area product—in ×10?6 milliliters per gram per second; V p: residual brain region blood volume in microliters per gram) measurements were performed as described previously ( 12 , 19 ). Further discussions about the PS and V p terms can be found in Bassingthwaighte et al. ( 20 ). Briefly, an IV bolus injection of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS) containing either 125I-F(ab?)24.1, 125I-pF(ab?)24.1, or 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 (100 ?Ci) was rapidly injected into the femoral vein of an anesthetized (isoflurane, 1.5%) WT mouse. Serial blood samples (20 ?l) were collected from the femoral artery over the next 30–120 min, diluted to a volume of 100 ?l with saline, and centrifuged. The supernatant was then TCA precipitated, and the precipitate was assayed for 125I radioactivity. At 30–60 s prior to the end of the experiment, a aliquot of 131I radiolabeled bovine serum albumin (100 ?Ci) was administered IV to serve as a V p indicator of vascular space. After the final blood sample, the animals were sacrificed, the brain and meninges were removed, and the brain was dissected into cortex, caudateputamen (neostriatum), hippocampus, thalamus, brain stem, and cerebellum. Tissue was lyophilized, and dry weights were determined with a microbalance and converted to respective wet weights with wet weight/dry weight ratios previously determined. Tissue and plasma samples were assayed for 125I radioactivity in a two channel gamma counter (Packard COBRA II) with radioactivity corrected for background and crossover of 131I activity into the 125I channel. Data are presented as ±SEM values with statistical evaluation using ANOVA with a significance accepted at the P <0.05 level. The PS and V p measurements were calculated as described previously ( 21 ). Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) A? peptide (A?40, A?42, and fibrillar A?40 and A?42) was coated in the wells of 96-well microtiter plates (Immulon 1B, Thermo Lab Systems, Franklin, MA) at a concentration of 1 ?g/well. Fibrils were formed by incubating A?40 or A?42 in pH 7.4 Tris buffer at 37°C for ~48 h. For the soluble form of A? peptide, freshly synthesized peptides were used. The wells were washed with PBS and blocked with 100 ?l of PBS containing 1% of bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) at room temperature for 60 min. The wells were rinsed again with PBS and serially diluted samples of IgG4G8, IgG4.1, or Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were then tested in triplicate. The antibody IgG4G8 (Signet Labs, Dedham, MA) was used as a positive control and L227-IgG1 kappa antibody produced by mouse B lymphocyte as a negative control. After 3 h incubation at 37°C, the wells were washed with PBS and incubated with 100 ng of Fab-specific, goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma A-1682) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed and equilibrated with diethanolamine buffer pH 9.8 for 5 min. 4-Nitrophenyl phosphate disodium (pNPP, Sigma) was used as a substrate to visualize the bound antibodies and fragments. After 15 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 ?l of 1 M sodium hydroxide. Optical densities were recorded at 405 nm using an automated plate reader spectrophotometer (Spectramax Plus). In Vitro Labeling of Amyloid Plaques in APP/PS1 Mouse Sections with Radioiodinated Antibodies and Fragments 125I-IgG4.1, 125I-F(ab?)24.1, 125I-Gd-DOTA-F(ab?)24.1, 125I-pF (ab?)24.1, 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1, or buffer were incubated in vitro with sections of unfixed APP/PS1 mouse brain using a modified procedure as described previously ( 22 ). Free iodine was removed by dialyzing each antibody overnight against PBS and then rinsed further in a centrifugal filter (Vivaspin 20, 30,00 MWCO, Cat. #VS2022, Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany) with five changes of PBS. 15 ?m cryo-sections were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with 5×105 cpm radioiodinated antibody or in 250 ?l of TBS (50 mM Tris HCl, 138 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% BSA, 0.6 mg/ml magnesium chloride, 0.04 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.002 mg/ml chymostatin, and 0.004 mg/ml leupeptin. The sections then underwent immunohistochemistry (IH) for amyloid using an anti-A? polyclonal rabbit antibody (Anti-Pan ?-Amyloid, 1:2,000, Cat. #44–136, Biosource International, Camarillo, CA). Next, the sections were dipped in an autoradiographic emulsion (Type NTB-3, Kodak, Rochester, NY) for direct comparison of 125I-labeled amyloid deposits to anti-A? IH. The slides were dipped in emulsion, exposed for various durations, and developed according to the instructions. The sections were dehydrated with successive changes of ethanol and xylene and then coverslipped. In Vivo Labeling of Amyloid Plaques in APP/PS1 Mouse Brain with Radioiodinated Antibodies and Fragments APP/PS1 transgenic mice (9 months of age) were catheterized in the femoral vein under general anesthesia (isoflurane, 1.5%) and injected with 1 mg (2 mCi) of 125I-F(ab?)24.1, 125I-Gd- DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1, or a non-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG1 kappa purified from mouse myeloma L227, Cat. #HB-96, ATCC, Manassas, VA) as a control. After 4 h, each animal was given an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg, IP) and perfused with PBS, followed by neutral-buffered, 10% formalin, and then 10% sucrose, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. Brains were removed and frozen in 2-methylbutane chilled in dry ice. Frozen sections (15 ?m) of each brain were cut with a cryostat and then processed with anti-A? IH and emulsion autoradiography for the presence of radiolabeled amyloid deposits using the same methods described above. Incubation of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 with APP Mouse Brain Slices In Vitro for MR Imaging of Contrast Enhanced Amyloid Plaques Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 was incubated with unfixed APP transgenic mouse brain slices to test the ability of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 to bind amyloid plaques and provide plaque specific contrast enhancement for MRI. Briefly, a 29-month old APP mouse was perfused with PBS following an overdose with sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg, IP). The brain was removed and 500-?m slices were cut with a Vibratome. Slices containing the hippocampus were incubated in Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 (1 mg/ml in PBS) for 2 h at 37°C. Control slices were also made by incubating the slices with PBS alone. The slices were rinsed in PBS for 1 h Before fixation, the slices were placed on glass microscope slides under 500-?m coverwells (Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR) to keep them flat. The slices were then fixed with neutral-buffered, 10% formalin overnight at 4°C. The next day, the slices were rinsed in PBS for 3 h at 4°C to remove excess formalin. The slices were embedded in 2% agar (Difco Bacto-Agar, Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) in a one-well, tissue culture chamber slide (Lab-Tek, Cat. #177410, Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) in a stacked orientation on the slide for MRI. The slices were imaged with a single loop coil using T 1- and T 2-weighted spin echo sequences in a 9.4 T horizontal bore scanner. The T 2- weighted spin-echo ( T 2SE) imaging parameters were: repetition time (TR)=2,000 ms; echo time (TE)=51.25 ms; image matrix size=25×96×32 in the x , y , and z directions, respectively, at corresponding fields-of-view (FOV) of 15.36×5.76× 3.84 mm, which resulted in nominal voxel dimensions of 60× 60×120 ?m. Acquisition time using the T 2SE sequence was 1 h, 42 min. The T 1-weighted spin-echo ( T 1SE) sequence parameters were: TR=400 ms, TE=7 ms, bandwidth=84 kHz; image matrix size=256×256×32 in the x , y , and z directions, respectively, with a corresponding FOV of 15.36×15.36× 3.84 mm. This resulted in nominal voxel dimensions of 60× 60×120 ?m, respectively. Acquisition time with the T 1SE sequence was 1 h, 8 min for one signal average.  Animals The in vivo labeling experiments were performed using transgenic mice that express two mutant human proteins associated with familial AD and have been described in detail elsewhere ( 15 ). Hemizygous transgenic mice (Tg2576) expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP695) ( 16 ) were mated with a strain of homozygous transgenic mice (M146L6.2) expressing mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1) ( 15 ). In one experiment, an APP (Tg2576) mouse was used. The animals were genotyped for the expression of both transgenes by a PCR method using a sample of mouse-tail DNA. The mice were housed in a virus-free barrier facility under a 12-h light/dark cycle, with ad libitum access to food and water. All procedures performed were in accordance with NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals using protocols approved by the Mayo Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  Preparation of F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 fragments Monoclonal IgG4.1 was developed as described by Poduslo et al. ( 14 ). It is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the first 15 amino acid residues of soluble and fibrillar A?40/42 peptides (unpublished results). Pure F(ab?)24.1 was obtained by digesting IgG4.1 using ficin at pH 6.5. The purification of the F(ab?)24.1 from the digested sample was followed as described previously by Poduslo et al. ( 14 ). Sample purity was evaluated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce Biotechnology).  Conjugation of DOTA to F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 The chelating agent 1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA; Strem Chemicals, Newburyport, MA), was coupled to F(ab?)24.1 using the carbodiimide reaction as described by Smith-Jones and Solita ( 17 ). DOTA was preferred over diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA) as the chelating agent due to the higher stability of its gadolinium complex. Conjugation of DOTA to F(ab?)24.1 involved two steps. In the first step, the active ester of DOTA was generated with carbodiimide at pH 7.8. In the second step, the active ester reacted with the amine side chain functional groups of lysine present in F(ab?)24.1. The number of DOTA molecules attached to F(ab?)24.1 was controlled by changing the aliquot concentration of the added active ester, by adjusting the reaction time and controlling the pH. Initially, the reactions were performed by mixing 1 mg of pure F(ab?)24.1 with 80 ?l of freshly prepared active ester, which is prepared using 0.361 mmol of DOTA and 0.313 mmol of N -hydroxy succinimide in 2 ml of metal free distilled water at pH 6.8 as described in Smith Jones and Solita ( 17 ), for different time periods (0.5, 1, 2, 18 h) at room temperature. For the characterization of DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 conjugate, the reaction mixture was concentrated using a 30kDa MWCO centrifugal filter (Vivaspin 20, Vivascience Sartorius group, Hannover, Germany) to about 5 mg/ml and washed (at least 12 times) with equal volumes of 1 M ammonium acetate (metal free) at pH 6.8. The success of this coupling was evaluated by incubating this derivative with an equimolar amount of radioactive gadolinium (153Gd) for subsequent autoradiographic analysis following SDS-PAGE. For the preparation of contrast agent for all other experiments, 1 mg of F(ab?)24.1 was mixed with 120 ?l of fresh active ester and incubated at room temperature for 0.5 h and non-radioactive GdCl3 was used for chelation. The Gd-DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 was further modified with the polyamine, putrescine using the carbodiimide reaction as described previously ( 14 ).  SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Isoelectric Focusing (IEF) Aliquots of IgG4.1, pF(ab?)24.1, and Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were run on a SDS-PAGE gel (7.5% T and 1% C ) in the absence of a reducing agent and stained with Coomassie blue using standard methods ( 18 ). IEF of IgG4.1 and pIgG4.1 as well as the F(ab?)24.1 and pF (ab?)24.1 samples were performed using a Bio-Rad Model 111 Mini IEF Cell according to the manufacturer?s instructions. Briefly, 40% Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholyte solution (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California) was used with a polyacrylamide gel (25% T , 0.75% C ). The gels were cast between the acrylic casting tray and gel support film to give a gel dimensions of 125×65×0.4 mm. Monomer ampholyte polymerization time under a fluorescent desk lamp was 45 min. Samples were loaded and allowed to diffuse into the gel for 6 min. IEF was carried out under constant voltage in a stepped fashion: 45 min at 100 V and 15 min at 450 V. Bio-Rad IEF standards containing nine native proteins with isoelectric points ranging from 4.45 to 9.6, as well as albumin (4.7) and cytochrome C (9.6), were run for comparison. All bands were visualized with 0.04% Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain.  Estimation of Bound DOTA per F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 Molecule by Paper Chromatography Three 20 ?l aliquots from 10 mg/ml DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 conjugates were mixed with 10, 20, 30 ?l aliquots of 1 mM GdCl3 spiked with a trace amount of radioactive 153Gd. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 16 h and then reincubated at 37°C for another 5 h after the addition of 50 ?l of 5 mM DTPA. Five ?l of sample was spotted onto a 20 cm silica gel impregnated glass fiber chromatography strip (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) and eluted with 5 mM DTPA (pH 6.0). The relative amount of bound Gd per molecule of DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 was determined by cutting the strip to 1 cm wide pieces and counting each of them in a gamma counter. Conjugated Gd-DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 remained at the origin whereas free (Gd- DTPA) moved with the solvent front. The number of DOTA covalently linked per F(ab?)24.1 molecule ( N ) was calculated from the mole ratio between Gd and DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 and from the observed ratio of [Gd-DOTA-F(ab?)24.1] and [Gd-DTPA]: N = Radioactivity at origin ( cpm ) × Gd mole concentration Total radioactivity ( cpm ) × Antibody fragment mole concentration The Gd concentration was further quantified using the mass spectroscopic facility at the University of California, Los Angels using Agilent 7500CC quadrupole inductively coupled mass spectrometer (ICP-MS).  Plasma Pharmacokinetic Studies After catheterizing the femoral vein and the femoral artery of each mouse under general anesthesia (isoflurane=1.5%; oxygen=4 l/min), 125I-F (ab?)24.1 or 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were administered intravenously in the femoral vein. The plasma pharmacokinetics of these compounds were determined by collecting serial blood samples (20 ?l) from the femoral artery over a period of time. The blood samples were diluted to a volume of 100 ?l with normal saline, centrifuged, and the supernatant was obtained. TCA precipitation was conducted and the supernatants of the samples and the pellets were assayed for 125I radioactivity in a gamma counter (Cobra II, Packard). Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of 125I-F(ab?)24.1 and 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were estimated by nonlinear curve fitting of the experimental data using Gauss-Newton (Levenberg and Hartley) algorithm (WinNonlin® Professional, version 5.2, Mountain view, CA). Secondary parameters such as the C max (maximum plasma concentration), the plasma clearance (CL), volume of distribution, and area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) were also calculated using the WinNonlin® software. The mean parameter values of both compounds were compared by Student’s t -test using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).  Permeability Measurements of Radioiodinated F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1, pF(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 and Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 at the BBB Aliquots of the proteins were labeled with 125I using the chloramine-T procedure and PS/ V p (PS: permeability coefficientsurface area product—in ×10?6 milliliters per gram per second; V p: residual brain region blood volume in microliters per gram) measurements were performed as described previously ( 12 , 19 ). Further discussions about the PS and V p terms can be found in Bassingthwaighte et al. ( 20 ). Briefly, an IV bolus injection of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS) containing either 125I-F(ab?)24.1, 125I-pF(ab?)24.1, or 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 (100 ?Ci) was rapidly injected into the femoral vein of an anesthetized (isoflurane, 1.5%) WT mouse. Serial blood samples (20 ?l) were collected from the femoral artery over the next 30–120 min, diluted to a volume of 100 ?l with saline, and centrifuged. The supernatant was then TCA precipitated, and the precipitate was assayed for 125I radioactivity. At 30–60 s prior to the end of the experiment, a aliquot of 131I radiolabeled bovine serum albumin (100 ?Ci) was administered IV to serve as a V p indicator of vascular space. After the final blood sample, the animals were sacrificed, the brain and meninges were removed, and the brain was dissected into cortex, caudateputamen (neostriatum), hippocampus, thalamus, brain stem, and cerebellum. Tissue was lyophilized, and dry weights were determined with a microbalance and converted to respective wet weights with wet weight/dry weight ratios previously determined. Tissue and plasma samples were assayed for 125I radioactivity in a two channel gamma counter (Packard COBRA II) with radioactivity corrected for background and crossover of 131I activity into the 125I channel. Data are presented as ±SEM values with statistical evaluation using ANOVA with a significance accepted at the P <0.05 level. The PS and V p measurements were calculated as described previously ( 21 ).  Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) A? peptide (A?40, A?42, and fibrillar A?40 and A?42) was coated in the wells of 96-well microtiter plates (Immulon 1B, Thermo Lab Systems, Franklin, MA) at a concentration of 1 ?g/well. Fibrils were formed by incubating A?40 or A?42 in pH 7.4 Tris buffer at 37°C for ~48 h. For the soluble form of A? peptide, freshly synthesized peptides were used. The wells were washed with PBS and blocked with 100 ?l of PBS containing 1% of bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) at room temperature for 60 min. The wells were rinsed again with PBS and serially diluted samples of IgG4G8, IgG4.1, or Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were then tested in triplicate. The antibody IgG4G8 (Signet Labs, Dedham, MA) was used as a positive control and L227-IgG1 kappa antibody produced by mouse B lymphocyte as a negative control. After 3 h incubation at 37°C, the wells were washed with PBS and incubated with 100 ng of Fab-specific, goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma A-1682) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed and equilibrated with diethanolamine buffer pH 9.8 for 5 min. 4-Nitrophenyl phosphate disodium (pNPP, Sigma) was used as a substrate to visualize the bound antibodies and fragments. After 15 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 ?l of 1 M sodium hydroxide. Optical densities were recorded at 405 nm using an automated plate reader spectrophotometer (Spectramax Plus).  In Vitro Labeling of Amyloid Plaques in APP/PS1 Mouse Sections with Radioiodinated Antibodies and Fragments 125I-IgG4.1, 125I-F(ab?)24.1, 125I-Gd-DOTA-F(ab?)24.1, 125I-pF (ab?)24.1, 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1, or buffer were incubated in vitro with sections of unfixed APP/PS1 mouse brain using a modified procedure as described previously ( 22 ). Free iodine was removed by dialyzing each antibody overnight against PBS and then rinsed further in a centrifugal filter (Vivaspin 20, 30,00 MWCO, Cat. #VS2022, Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany) with five changes of PBS. 15 ?m cryo-sections were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with 5×105 cpm radioiodinated antibody or in 250 ?l of TBS (50 mM Tris HCl, 138 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% BSA, 0.6 mg/ml magnesium chloride, 0.04 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.002 mg/ml chymostatin, and 0.004 mg/ml leupeptin. The sections then underwent immunohistochemistry (IH) for amyloid using an anti-A? polyclonal rabbit antibody (Anti-Pan ?-Amyloid, 1:2,000, Cat. #44–136, Biosource International, Camarillo, CA). Next, the sections were dipped in an autoradiographic emulsion (Type NTB-3, Kodak, Rochester, NY) for direct comparison of 125I-labeled amyloid deposits to anti-A? IH. The slides were dipped in emulsion, exposed for various durations, and developed according to the instructions. The sections were dehydrated with successive changes of ethanol and xylene and then coverslipped.  In Vivo Labeling of Amyloid Plaques in APP/PS1 Mouse Brain with Radioiodinated Antibodies and Fragments APP/PS1 transgenic mice (9 months of age) were catheterized in the femoral vein under general anesthesia (isoflurane, 1.5%) and injected with 1 mg (2 mCi) of 125I-F(ab?)24.1, 125I-Gd- DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1, or a non-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG1 kappa purified from mouse myeloma L227, Cat. #HB-96, ATCC, Manassas, VA) as a control. After 4 h, each animal was given an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg, IP) and perfused with PBS, followed by neutral-buffered, 10% formalin, and then 10% sucrose, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. Brains were removed and frozen in 2-methylbutane chilled in dry ice. Frozen sections (15 ?m) of each brain were cut with a cryostat and then processed with anti-A? IH and emulsion autoradiography for the presence of radiolabeled amyloid deposits using the same methods described above.  Incubation of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 with APP Mouse Brain Slices In Vitro for MR Imaging of Contrast Enhanced Amyloid Plaques Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 was incubated with unfixed APP transgenic mouse brain slices to test the ability of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 to bind amyloid plaques and provide plaque specific contrast enhancement for MRI. Briefly, a 29-month old APP mouse was perfused with PBS following an overdose with sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg, IP). The brain was removed and 500-?m slices were cut with a Vibratome. Slices containing the hippocampus were incubated in Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 (1 mg/ml in PBS) for 2 h at 37°C. Control slices were also made by incubating the slices with PBS alone. The slices were rinsed in PBS for 1 h Before fixation, the slices were placed on glass microscope slides under 500-?m coverwells (Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR) to keep them flat. The slices were then fixed with neutral-buffered, 10% formalin overnight at 4°C. The next day, the slices were rinsed in PBS for 3 h at 4°C to remove excess formalin. The slices were embedded in 2% agar (Difco Bacto-Agar, Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) in a one-well, tissue culture chamber slide (Lab-Tek, Cat. #177410, Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) in a stacked orientation on the slide for MRI. The slices were imaged with a single loop coil using T 1- and T 2-weighted spin echo sequences in a 9.4 T horizontal bore scanner. The T 2- weighted spin-echo ( T 2SE) imaging parameters were: repetition time (TR)=2,000 ms; echo time (TE)=51.25 ms; image matrix size=25×96×32 in the x , y , and z directions, respectively, at corresponding fields-of-view (FOV) of 15.36×5.76× 3.84 mm, which resulted in nominal voxel dimensions of 60× 60×120 ?m. Acquisition time using the T 2SE sequence was 1 h, 42 min. The T 1-weighted spin-echo ( T 1SE) sequence parameters were: TR=400 ms, TE=7 ms, bandwidth=84 kHz; image matrix size=256×256×32 in the x , y , and z directions, respectively, with a corresponding FOV of 15.36×15.36× 3.84 mm. This resulted in nominal voxel dimensions of 60× 60×120 ?m, respectively. Acquisition time with the T 1SE sequence was 1 h, 8 min for one signal average.  RESULTS Preparation of the Contrast Agent Purified F(ab?)24.1 was successfully linked with a chelating agent DOTA using carbodiimide chemistry at pH 7.8. The success of coupling F (ab?)24.1 with DOTA was evaluated by incubating DOTA-F (ab?)24.1 conjugate with equimolar radioactive gadolinium (153Gd) at pH 7.0 for subsequent autoradiographic analysis following SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 1A ). The autoradiogram showed a band close to 30 kDa which corresponds to the reduced light and heavy chains of Gd-DOTA coupled F(ab?)24.1. The band intensity increases with increasing reaction time period which indicates increasing amount of DOTA covalently linked with F(ab?)24.1. The weak band close to 15 kDa likely corresponds to unpurified SDS reduced impurity from the antibody digestion mixture such as Ficin, or more likely Fc fragments that result from the digestion and that are not removed during the purification process. The number of bound DOTA per F(ab?)24.1 molecule was calculated using paper chromatography, and the reaction conditions were controlled to covalently link either one or two DOTA per F(ab?)24.1 molecule by the addition of active ester with a reaction time of 0.5 h Figure 1B shows that the number of bound DOTA per F(ab?)24.1 ranged between one and three molecules and increases linearly with added active ester in the range studied. Similar results were found when the compounds were analyzed by ICP mass spectral analysis. The linear trend of the curve clearly depicts that F(ab?)24.1 is not saturated with DOTA and more sites are available for modification. One to two DOTA attachments per F(ab?)24.1 are desired as it was previously demonstrated that Gd-DTPA modification of another contrast agent with more than one Gd-DTPA moiety per molecule adversely affected its BBB permeability ( 22 ). Polyamine and DOTA Modified F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 After DOTA conjugation, the protein was modified with the polyamine putrescine using the carbodiimide reaction. The polyamine modification involves the conversion of carbodiimide activated carboxyl groups of protein into primary amino groups by 1,4-diaminobutane (putrescine). The extent of this reaction depends largely on the pH and the availability of the carboxyl groups. Previously we have demonstrated the protein p I dependence of polyamine modification of F(ab?)24.1, where the decrease in pH of the reaction increases the degree of polyamine modification of the protein followed by a progressive decrease in its antigen binding ability ( 14 ). IgG4.1 has a neutral p I (~6.8) and the F(ab?)24.1 has a p I of 7.9, whereas, the completely polyamine modified F(ab?)24.1 has a basic p I of ~9.7 ( 14 ). Similarly, the DOTA and polyamine-modified F(ab?)24.1 showed a shift in the isoelectric point to a more basic p I , demonstrating modification of the carboxylic acid groups on the protein with the polyamine ( Fig. 1C ). Complete modification of DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 with the polyamine was demonstrated, therefore no further chromatographic purification was necessary to separate DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 from any residual unmodified DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 protein. ELISA of IgG4.1 and F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 Derivatives With and Without Gd-DOTA Polyamine Modifications Figure 2 shows the ELISA binding of soluble and fibrillar form of A?40 and A?42 to IgG4G8, IgG4.1, F(ab?)24.1 derivatives with and without Gd-DOTA and polyamine modifications. IgG4G8 was used as a positive control, which binds to amino acid residues 17–24 of A?40/42 peptide. As shown in Fig. 2A–D, F (ab?)24.1 showed greater binding to soluble and fibrillar forms of A?40 and A?42 compared to Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1. Gd- DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 showed relatively better binding compared to the whole IgG4.1 and IgG4G8 with soluble A?40/42 ( Fig. 2A, B ). With fibrils, however, they all showed comparable binding ( Fig. 2C, D ). When IgG specific whole antibody molecule was used as the secondary antibody for the ELISA experiment, IgG4.1 and IgG4G8 showed enhanced binding to soluble A?40 compared to the F(ab?)24.1 fragments (data not shown). The non-specific L227 antibody which was used a negative control did not show any binding to A?40–42 peptides (data not shown). Plasma Pharmacokinetics of <sup>125</sup> I-F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 and <sup>125</sup>I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 Plasma concentration profiles over a course of time for 125I-F(ab?)24.1 and 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were fitted by the function: C ( t )= Ae ? ?t + Be ? ?t, where C ( t ) is the amount (?Ci) of 125I-F(ab?)24.1 or 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1 per 1 ml of plasma; A and B are the intercepts, and ? and ? are the slopes of the curve. This biexponetial fit was determined adequate based on Akaike information criterion, Schwartz criterion, F -test, and by the visual examination of the residual plots. The plasma clearance (CL) of 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 is significantly higher than 125I-F(ab?)24.1, which is reflected in the lower plasma levels of 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 compared to 125I-F(ab?)24.1 ( Fig. 3A ). Moreover, the ? and ? half-lives of 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were substantially lower than that of 125I-F(ab?)24.1, resulting in lower C max and AUC values ( Table I ). Similarly the polyamine modified F(ab?)24.1 has a rapid plasma clearance and much lower ? and ? half-lives than the Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1. The accumulation of these compounds are greater in the kidney compare to the liver and spleen ( Fig. 3B ). While pF(ab?)24.1 has a greater accumulation in the kidney, the Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 has nearly five fold lower accumulation in the kidney. BBB Permeability of Radioiodinated Contrast Agent The contrast agent was radioiodinated with 125I/131I and the permeability coefficient×surface area product (PS×10?6 milliliters per gram per second) and residual blood volume ( V p in microliters per gram) were determined ( Table II ). The contrast agent had PS values ranging from 27 to 58×10?6 ml g?1 s?1 in six different brain regions of mice, where as the unmodified F(ab?)24.1 had PS values from 1 to 2×10?6 ml g?1 s?1, which showed 18–33 fold higher BBB permeability for the contrast agent compared to the native F(ab?)24.1. The V p values were not significantly different between the contrast agent and F(ab?)24.1. The high PS value of the contrast agent indicates high BBB permeability which may facilitate its delivery at the blood brain barrier to target amyloid plaques in APP/PS1 mouse brain. Interestingly, addition of ~2 DOTA molecules per F(ab?)24.1 did not decrease the BBB permeability of the molecule compared to polyamine modified F(ab?)24.1 without Gd-DOTA, which is attributed to the relative smaller size of DOTA compared to the much larger F(ab?)24.1 molecule. Labeling of Amyloid Plaques In Vitro 125I-IgG4.1, 125I-F (ab?)24.1, 125I-Gd-DOTA-F(ab?)24.1, 125I-pF(ab?)24.1, and 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were tested in vitro with APP/PS1 mouse brain sections to determine their ability to bind amyloid plaque deposits in APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse. All of them labeled amyloid plaques and deposits in APP/PS1 mouse brain sections in vitro ( Fig. 4 ). The antibody fragment, F(ab?)24.1, labeled amyloid deposits to a similar level as compared to the intact immunoglobulin, IgG4.1, in APP/PS1 mouse sections ( Fig. 4C and B , respectively). The polyamine and gadolinium-modified versions of F(ab?)24.1, particularly the putative contrast agent, Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1, also labeled amyloid plaques in the mouse brain sections ( Fig. 4D–F ). In Vivo Targeting 125I-F(ab?)24.1, 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1, or a non-specific mouse monoclonal antibody were injected IV into APP/PS1 mice to determine the ability of the gadolinium and polyamine modified fragment to label amyloid deposits within the brain. The amyloid deposits were stained using a rabbit polyclonal anti-A? antibody and immunohistochemical methods while the presence of the radiolabeled immunoglobulins was detected by emulsion microautoradiography with exposure times of 1, 2, and 4 weeks (for 4 week exposure see Fig. 5 ). Labeling, demonstrated by high densities of exposed (black) silver grains, could be observed for all three immunoglobulins on the brain sections after 1 week of exposure. The pattern of labeling was much different for the three immunoglobulins. The labeling of F(ab?)24.1 and the non-specific antibody was observed predominantly in blood vessels and blood vessel walls (i.e., arrowheads, Fig. 5A, C ). The non-specific antibody did not label amyloid plaques. Labeled amyloid plaques were observed occasionally for F(ab?)24.1. These were limited to small, isolated clusters of labeled deposits in close proximity to a blood vessel (i.e., arrows, Fig. 5C and D ). Most amyloid plaques, however, were not labeled by F(ab?)24.1. The gadolinium and putrescine-modified fragment, Gd-DOTA- pF(ab?)2, however, exhibited labeling of amyloid deposits throughout the parenchyma of the brain, particularly the cortex and hippocampus ( Fig. 5E and F ). This is most likely due to the higher permeability of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)2 at the BBB. These results demonstrate that Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)2 crosses the BBB and labels amyloid plaques in vivo after a single IV bolus injection. Incubation of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 with APP Mouse Brain Slices In Vitro for MR Imaging of Contrast Enhanced Amyloid Plaques Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 was incubated with unfixed APP transgenic mouse brain slices to test the ability of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 to bind amyloid plaques and provide plaque specific contrast enhancement for MRI. Representative images from the MRI scans are illustrated in Fig. 6 . The T 1- weighted spin echo ( T 1SE) image in Fig. 6A shows many hyperintense foci (bright spots) throughout the cortex and hippocampus. Many of these hyperinstense foci matched the hypointense foci (dark spots) in the T 2-weighted spin echo ( T 2SE) image in Fig. 6C by anatomical spatial co- registration using linked-cursor image analysis software (Analyze®) ( 23 ). These hypointense foci are not present in T 2SE images of non-transgenic, wild-type mice, which also do not exhibit amyloid plaques. While hypointense foci can be observed in T 2SE image of AD mouse brain in Fig. 6D , no hyperintense foci (bright spots) were observed in T 1SE images shown in Fig. 6B in the absence of a gadolinium modified contrast enhancing agent. Plaques appear as dark spots on T 2SE images because they contain iron. Since iron is a paramagnetic species, it causes local magnetic susceptibility resulting in decreased signal intensity. We have previously shown that most of the hypointense foci (dark spots) observed in T 2SE images of AD mouse brain can be spatially co-registered to Thioflavin S -positive amyloid plaques in histologically stained sections ( 6 , 11 , 25 ). Gadolinium is a commonly-used MRI contrast enhancing agent that accelerates relaxation in T 1SE scans. Therefore, the presence of hyperintense foci in the T 1SE image that also spatially co-register with hypointense foci on the T 2SE image indicates that the Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 not only labeled amyloid plaques in the APP mouse brain slice, but also caused plaque-specific selective contrast enhancement in the T 1SE MR image.  RESULTS Preparation of the Contrast Agent Purified F(ab?)24.1 was successfully linked with a chelating agent DOTA using carbodiimide chemistry at pH 7.8. The success of coupling F (ab?)24.1 with DOTA was evaluated by incubating DOTA-F (ab?)24.1 conjugate with equimolar radioactive gadolinium (153Gd) at pH 7.0 for subsequent autoradiographic analysis following SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 1A ).

Previously we have demonstrated the protein p I dependence of polyamine modification of F(ab?)24.1, where the decrease in pH of the reaction increases the degree of polyamine modification of the protein followed by a progressive decrease in its antigen binding ability ( 14 ). IgG4.1 has a neutral p I (~6.8) and the F(ab?)24.1 has a p I of 7.9, whereas, the completely polyamine modified F(ab?)24.1 has a basic p I of ~9.7 ( 14 ). Similarly, the DOTA and polyamine-modified F(ab?)24.1 showed a shift in the isoelectric point to a more basic p I , demonstrating modification of the carboxylic acid groups on the protein with the polyamine ( Fig. 1C ). Complete modification of DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 with the polyamine was demonstrated, therefore no further chromatographic purification was necessary to separate DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 from any residual unmodified DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 protein. ELISA of IgG4.1 and F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 Derivatives With and Without Gd-DOTA Polyamine Modifications Figure 2 shows the ELISA binding of soluble and fibrillar form of A?40 and A?42 to IgG4G8, IgG4.1, F(ab?)24.1 derivatives with and without Gd-DOTA and polyamine modifications. IgG4G8 was used as a positive control, which binds to amino acid residues 17–24 of A?40/42 peptide. As shown in Fig. 2A–D, F (ab?)24.1 showed greater binding to soluble and fibrillar forms of A?40 and A?42 compared to Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1. Gd- DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 showed relatively better binding compared to the whole IgG4.1 and IgG4G8 with soluble A?40/42 ( Fig. 2A, B ). With fibrils, however, they all showed comparable binding ( Fig. 2C, D ). When IgG specific whole antibody molecule was used as the secondary antibody for the ELISA experiment, IgG4.1 and IgG4G8 showed enhanced binding to soluble A?40 compared to the F(ab?)24.1 fragments (data not shown). The non-specific L227 antibody which was used a negative control did not show any binding to A?40–42 peptides (data not shown). Plasma Pharmacokinetics of <sup>125</sup> I-F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 and <sup>125</sup>I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 Plasma concentration profiles over a course of time for 125I-F(ab?)24.1 and 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were fitted by the function: C ( t )= Ae ? ?t + Be ? ?t, where C ( t ) is the amount (?Ci) of 125I-F(ab?)24.1 or 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1 per 1 ml of plasma; A and B are the intercepts, and ? and ? are the slopes of the curve. This biexponetial fit was determined adequate based on Akaike information criterion, Schwartz criterion, F -test, and by the visual examination of the residual plots. The plasma clearance (CL) of 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 is significantly higher than 125I-F(ab?)24.1, which is reflected in the lower plasma levels of 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 compared to 125I-F(ab?)24.1 ( Fig. 3A ). Moreover, the ? and ? half-lives of 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were substantially lower than that of 125I-F(ab?)24.1, resulting in lower C max and AUC values ( Table I ). Similarly the polyamine modified F(ab?)24.1 has a rapid plasma clearance and much lower ? and ? half-lives than the Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1. The accumulation of these compounds are greater in the kidney compare to the liver and spleen ( Fig. 3B ). While pF(ab?)24.1 has a greater accumulation in the kidney, the Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 has nearly five fold lower accumulation in the kidney. BBB Permeability of Radioiodinated Contrast Agent The contrast agent was radioiodinated with 125I/131I and the permeability coefficient×surface area product (PS×10?6 milliliters per gram per second) and residual blood volume ( V p in microliters per gram) were determined ( Table II ). The contrast agent had PS values ranging from 27 to 58×10?6 ml g?1 s?1 in six different brain regions of mice, where as the unmodified F(ab?)24.1 had PS values from 1 to 2×10?6 ml g?1 s?1, which showed 18–33 fold higher BBB permeability for the contrast agent compared to the native F(ab?)24.1. The V p values were not significantly different between the contrast agent and F(ab?)24.1. The high PS value of the contrast agent indicates high BBB permeability which may facilitate its delivery at the blood brain barrier to target amyloid plaques in APP/PS1 mouse brain. Interestingly, addition of ~2 DOTA molecules per F(ab?)24.1 did not decrease the BBB permeability of the molecule compared to polyamine modified F(ab?)24.1 without Gd-DOTA, which is attributed to the relative smaller size of DOTA compared to the much larger F(ab?)24.1 molecule. Labeling of Amyloid Plaques In Vitro 125I-IgG4.1, 125I-F (ab?)24.1, 125I-Gd-DOTA-F(ab?)24.1, 125I-pF(ab?)24.1, and 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were tested in vitro with APP/PS1 mouse brain sections to determine their ability to bind amyloid plaque deposits in APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse. All of them labeled amyloid plaques and deposits in APP/PS1 mouse brain sections in vitro ( Fig. 4 ). The antibody fragment, F(ab?)24.1, labeled amyloid deposits to a similar level as compared to the intact immunoglobulin, IgG4.1, in APP/PS1 mouse sections ( Fig. 4C and B , respectively). The polyamine and gadolinium-modified versions of F(ab?)24.1, particularly the putative contrast agent, Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1, also labeled amyloid plaques in the mouse brain sections ( Fig. 4D–F ). In Vivo Targeting 125I-F(ab?)24.1, 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1, or a non-specific mouse monoclonal antibody were injected IV into APP/PS1 mice to determine the ability of the gadolinium and polyamine modified fragment to label amyloid deposits within the brain. The amyloid deposits were stained using a rabbit polyclonal anti-A? antibody and immunohistochemical methods while the presence of the radiolabeled immunoglobulins was detected by emulsion microautoradiography with exposure times of 1, 2, and 4 weeks (for 4 week exposure see Fig. 5 ). Labeling, demonstrated by high densities of exposed (black) silver grains, could be observed for all three immunoglobulins on the brain sections after 1 week of exposure. The pattern of labeling was much different for the three immunoglobulins. The labeling of F(ab?)24.1 and the non-specific antibody was observed predominantly in blood vessels and blood vessel walls (i.e., arrowheads, Fig. 5A, C ). The non-specific antibody did not label amyloid plaques. Labeled amyloid plaques were observed occasionally for F(ab?)24.1. These were limited to small, isolated clusters of labeled deposits in close proximity to a blood vessel (i.e., arrows, Fig. 5C and D ). Most amyloid plaques, however, were not labeled by F(ab?)24.1. The gadolinium and putrescine-modified fragment, Gd-DOTA- pF(ab?)2, however, exhibited labeling of amyloid deposits throughout the parenchyma of the brain, particularly the cortex and hippocampus ( Fig. 5E and F ). This is most likely due to the higher permeability of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)2 at the BBB. These results demonstrate that Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)2 crosses the BBB and labels amyloid plaques in vivo after a single IV bolus injection. Incubation of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 with APP Mouse Brain Slices In Vitro for MR Imaging of Contrast Enhanced Amyloid Plaques Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 was incubated with unfixed APP transgenic mouse brain slices to test the ability of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 to bind amyloid plaques and provide plaque specific contrast enhancement for MRI. Representative images from the MRI scans are illustrated in Fig. 6 . The T 1- weighted spin echo ( T 1SE) image in Fig. 6A shows many hyperintense foci (bright spots) throughout the cortex and hippocampus. Many of these hyperinstense foci matched the hypointense foci (dark spots) in the T 2-weighted spin echo ( T 2SE) image in Fig. 6C by anatomical spatial co- registration using linked-cursor image analysis software (Analyze®) ( 23 ). These hypointense foci are not present in T 2SE images of non-transgenic, wild-type mice, which also do not exhibit amyloid plaques. While hypointense foci can be observed in T 2SE image of AD mouse brain in Fig. 6D , no hyperintense foci (bright spots) were observed in T 1SE images shown in Fig. 6B in the absence of a gadolinium modified contrast enhancing agent. Plaques appear as dark spots on T 2SE images because they contain iron. Since iron is a paramagnetic species, it causes local magnetic susceptibility resulting in decreased signal intensity. We have previously shown that most of the hypointense foci (dark spots) observed in T 2SE images of AD mouse brain can be spatially co-registered to Thioflavin S -positive amyloid plaques in histologically stained sections ( 6 , 11 , 25 ). Gadolinium is a commonly-used MRI contrast enhancing agent that accelerates relaxation in T 1SE scans. Therefore, the presence of hyperintense foci in the T 1SE image that also spatially co-register with hypointense foci on the T 2SE image indicates that the Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 not only labeled amyloid plaques in the APP mouse brain slice, but also caused plaque-specific selective contrast enhancement in the T 1SE MR image.  Preparation of the Contrast Agent Purified F(ab?)24.1 was successfully linked with a chelating agent DOTA using carbodiimide chemistry at pH 7.8.

Similar results were found when the compounds were analyzed by ICP mass spectral analysis. The linear trend of the curve clearly depicts that F(ab?)24.1 is not saturated with DOTA and more sites are available for modification. One to two DOTA attachments per F(ab?)24.1 are desired as it was previously demonstrated that Gd-DTPA modification of another contrast agent with more than one Gd-DTPA moiety per molecule adversely affected its BBB permeability ( 22 ).  Preparation of the Contrast Agent Purified F(ab?)24.1 was successfully linked with a chelating agent DOTA using carbodiimide chemistry at pH 7.8. The success of coupling F (ab?)24.1 with DOTA was evaluated by incubating DOTA-F (ab?)24.1 conjugate with equimolar radioactive gadolinium (153Gd) at pH 7.0 for subsequent autoradiographic analysis following SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 1A ). The autoradiogram showed a band close to 30 kDa which corresponds to the reduced light and heavy chains of Gd-DOTA coupled F(ab?)24.1. The band intensity increases with increasing reaction time period which indicates increasing amount of DOTA covalently linked with F(ab?)24.1. The weak band close to 15 kDa likely corresponds to unpurified SDS reduced impurity from the antibody digestion mixture such as Ficin, or more likely Fc fragments that result from the digestion and that are not removed during the purification process. The number of bound DOTA per F(ab?)24.1 molecule was calculated using paper chromatography, and the reaction conditions were controlled to covalently link either one or two DOTA per F(ab?)24.1 molecule by the addition of active ester with a reaction time of 0.5 h Figure 1B shows that the number of bound DOTA per F(ab?)24.1 ranged between one and three molecules and increases linearly with added active ester in the range studied. Similar results were found when the compounds were analyzed by ICP mass spectral analysis.

Polyamine and DOTA Modified F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 After DOTA conjugation, the protein was modified with the polyamine putrescine using the carbodiimide reaction. The polyamine modification involves the conversion of carbodiimide activated carboxyl groups of protein into primary amino groups by 1,4-diaminobutane (putrescine). The extent of this reaction depends largely on the pH and the availability of the carboxyl groups. Previously we have demonstrated the protein p I dependence of polyamine modification of F(ab?)24.1, where the decrease in pH of the reaction increases the degree of polyamine modification of the protein followed by a progressive decrease in its antigen binding ability ( 14 ). IgG4.1 has a neutral p I (~6.8) and the F(ab?)24.1 has a p I of 7.9, whereas, the completely polyamine modified F(ab?)24.1 has a basic p I of ~9.7 ( 14 ). Similarly, the DOTA and polyamine-modified F(ab?)24.1 showed a shift in the isoelectric point to a more basic p I , demonstrating modification of the carboxylic acid groups on the protein with the polyamine ( Fig. 1C ). Complete modification of DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 with the polyamine was demonstrated, therefore no further chromatographic purification was necessary to separate DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 from any residual unmodified DOTA-F(ab?)24.1 protein.

ELISA of IgG4.1 and F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 Derivatives With and Without Gd-DOTA Polyamine Modifications Figure 2 shows the ELISA binding of soluble and fibrillar form of A?40 and A?42 to IgG4G8, IgG4.1, F(ab?)24.1 derivatives with and without Gd-DOTA and polyamine modifications. IgG4G8 was used as a positive control, which binds to amino acid residues 17–24 of A?40/42 peptide. As shown in Fig. 2A–D, F (ab?)24.1 showed greater binding to soluble and fibrillar forms of A?40 and A?42 compared to Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1. Gd- DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 showed relatively better binding compared to the whole IgG4.1 and IgG4G8 with soluble A?40/42 ( Fig. 2A, B ). With fibrils, however, they all showed comparable binding ( Fig. 2C, D ). When IgG specific whole antibody molecule was used as the secondary antibody for the ELISA experiment, IgG4.1 and IgG4G8 showed enhanced binding to soluble A?40 compared to the F(ab?)24.1 fragments (data not shown). The non-specific L227 antibody which was used a negative control did not show any binding to A?40–42 peptides (data not shown).

Plasma Pharmacokinetics of <sup>125</sup> I-F(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 and <sup>125</sup>I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 Plasma concentration profiles over a course of time for 125I-F(ab?)24.1 and 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were fitted by the function: C ( t )= Ae ? ?t + Be ? ?t, where C ( t ) is the amount (?Ci) of 125I-F(ab?)24.1 or 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1 per 1 ml of plasma; A and B are the intercepts, and ? and ? are the slopes of the curve. This biexponetial fit was determined adequate based on Akaike information criterion, Schwartz criterion, F -test, and by the visual examination of the residual plots. The plasma clearance (CL) of 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 is significantly higher than 125I-F(ab?)24.1, which is reflected in the lower plasma levels of 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 compared to 125I-F(ab?)24.1 ( Fig. 3A ). Moreover, the ? and ? half-lives of 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were substantially lower than that of 125I-F(ab?)24.1, resulting in lower C max and AUC values ( Table I ). Similarly the polyamine modified F(ab?)24.1 has a rapid plasma clearance and much lower ? and ? half-lives than the Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1. The accumulation of these compounds are greater in the kidney compare to the liver and spleen ( Fig. 3B ). While pF(ab?)24.1 has a greater accumulation in the kidney, the Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 has nearly five fold lower accumulation in the kidney.

BBB Permeability of Radioiodinated Contrast Agent The contrast agent was radioiodinated with 125I/131I and the permeability coefficient×surface area product (PS×10?6 milliliters per gram per second) and residual blood volume ( V p in microliters per gram) were determined ( Table II ). The contrast agent had PS values ranging from 27 to 58×10?6 ml g?1 s?1 in six different brain regions of mice, where as the unmodified F(ab?)24.1 had PS values from 1 to 2×10?6 ml g?1 s?1, which showed 18–33 fold higher BBB permeability for the contrast agent compared to the native F(ab?)24.1. The V p values were not significantly different between the contrast agent and F(ab?)24.1. The high PS value of the contrast agent indicates high BBB permeability which may facilitate its delivery at the blood brain barrier to target amyloid plaques in APP/PS1 mouse brain. Interestingly, addition of ~2 DOTA molecules per F(ab?)24.1 did not decrease the BBB permeability of the molecule compared to polyamine modified F(ab?)24.1 without Gd-DOTA, which is attributed to the relative smaller size of DOTA compared to the much larger F(ab?)24.1 molecule.

Labeling of Amyloid Plaques In Vitro 125I-IgG4.1, 125I-F (ab?)24.1, 125I-Gd-DOTA-F(ab?)24.1, 125I-pF(ab?)24.1, and 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were tested in vitro with APP/PS1 mouse brain sections to determine their ability to bind amyloid plaque deposits in APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse. All of them labeled amyloid plaques and deposits in APP/PS1 mouse brain sections in vitro ( Fig. 4 ). The antibody fragment, F(ab?)24.1, labeled amyloid deposits to a similar level as compared to the intact immunoglobulin, IgG4.1, in APP/PS1 mouse sections ( Fig. 4C and B , respectively). The polyamine and gadolinium-modified versions of F(ab?)24.1, particularly the putative contrast agent, Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1, also labeled amyloid plaques in the mouse brain sections ( Fig. 4D–F ).  Labeling of Amyloid Plaques In Vitro 125I-IgG4.1, 125I-F (ab?)24.1, 125I-Gd-DOTA-F(ab?)24.1, 125I-pF(ab?)24.1, and 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 were tested in vitro with APP/PS1 mouse brain sections to determine their ability to bind amyloid plaque deposits in APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse.

The polyamine and gadolinium-modified versions of F(ab?)24.1, particularly the putative contrast agent, Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1, also labeled amyloid plaques in the mouse brain sections ( Fig. 4D–F ).  In Vivo Targeting 125I-F(ab?)24.1, 125I-Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1, or a non-specific mouse monoclonal antibody were injected IV into APP/PS1 mice to determine the ability of the gadolinium and polyamine modified fragment to label amyloid deposits within the brain. The amyloid deposits were stained using a rabbit polyclonal anti-A? antibody and immunohistochemical methods while the presence of the radiolabeled immunoglobulins was detected by emulsion microautoradiography with exposure times of 1, 2, and 4 weeks (for 4 week exposure see Fig. 5 ). Labeling, demonstrated by high densities of exposed (black) silver grains, could be observed for all three immunoglobulins on the brain sections after 1 week of exposure. The pattern of labeling was much different for the three immunoglobulins. The labeling of F(ab?)24.1 and the non-specific antibody was observed predominantly in blood vessels and blood vessel walls (i.e., arrowheads, Fig. 5A, C ). The non-specific antibody did not label amyloid plaques. Labeled amyloid plaques were observed occasionally for F(ab?)24.1. These were limited to small, isolated clusters of labeled deposits in close proximity to a blood vessel (i.e., arrows, Fig. 5C and D ). Most amyloid plaques, however, were not labeled by F(ab?)24.1. The gadolinium and putrescine-modified fragment, Gd-DOTA- pF(ab?)2, however, exhibited labeling of amyloid deposits throughout the parenchyma of the brain, particularly the cortex and hippocampus ( Fig. 5E and F ). This is most likely due to the higher permeability of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)2 at the BBB. These results demonstrate that Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)2 crosses the BBB and labels amyloid plaques in vivo after a single IV bolus injection.

Incubation of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 with APP Mouse Brain Slices In Vitro for MR Imaging of Contrast Enhanced Amyloid Plaques Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 was incubated with unfixed APP transgenic mouse brain slices to test the ability of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 to bind amyloid plaques and provide plaque specific contrast enhancement for MRI. Representative images from the MRI scans are illustrated in Fig. 6 . The T 1- weighted spin echo ( T 1SE) image in Fig. 6A shows many hyperintense foci (bright spots) throughout the cortex and hippocampus. Many of these hyperinstense foci matched the hypointense foci (dark spots) in the T 2-weighted spin echo ( T 2SE) image in Fig. 6C by anatomical spatial co- registration using linked-cursor image analysis software (Analyze®) ( 23 ). These hypointense foci are not present in T 2SE images of non-transgenic, wild-type mice, which also do not exhibit amyloid plaques. While hypointense foci can be observed in T 2SE image of AD mouse brain in Fig. 6D , no hyperintense foci (bright spots) were observed in T 1SE images shown in Fig. 6B in the absence of a gadolinium modified contrast enhancing agent. Plaques appear as dark spots on T 2SE images because they contain iron. Since iron is a paramagnetic species, it causes local magnetic susceptibility resulting in decreased signal intensity. We have previously shown that most of the hypointense foci (dark spots) observed in T 2SE images of AD mouse brain can be spatially co-registered to Thioflavin S -positive amyloid plaques in histologically stained sections ( 6 , 11 , 25 ). Gadolinium is a commonly-used MRI contrast enhancing agent that accelerates relaxation in T 1SE scans. Therefore, the presence of hyperintense foci in the T 1SE image that also spatially co-register with hypointense foci on the T 2SE image indicates that the Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 not only labeled amyloid plaques in the APP mouse brain slice, but also caused plaque-specific selective contrast enhancement in the T 1SE MR image.  Incubation of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)<sub>2</sub>4.1 with APP Mouse Brain Slices In Vitro for MR Imaging of Contrast Enhanced Amyloid Plaques Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 was incubated with unfixed APP transgenic mouse brain slices to test the ability of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 to bind amyloid plaques and provide plaque specific contrast enhancement for MRI.

Many of these hyperinstense foci matched the hypointense foci (dark spots) in the T 2-weighted spin echo ( T 2SE) image in Fig. 6C by anatomical spatial co- registration using linked-cursor image analysis software (Analyze®) ( 23 ). These hypointense foci are not present in T 2SE images of non-transgenic, wild-type mice, which also do not exhibit amyloid plaques. While hypointense foci can be observed in T 2SE image of AD mouse brain in Fig. 6D , no hyperintense foci (bright spots) were observed in T 1SE images shown in Fig. 6B in the absence of a gadolinium modified contrast enhancing agent.

Therefore, the presence of hyperintense foci in the T 1SE image that also spatially co-register with hypointense foci on the T 2SE image indicates that the Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 not only labeled amyloid plaques in the APP mouse brain slice, but also caused plaque-specific selective contrast enhancement in the T 1SE MR image.  DISCUSSION The present studies demonstrates that Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1 showed nearly 30 fold increase in BBB permeability compared to the unmodified F(ab?)24.1, binds specifically to amyloid plaques, and produces local changes in tissue contrast enhancement with APP transgenic mouse brain slices that are detectable by MRI. In principle, an ideal brain MRI contrast agent for visualizing and quantifying the pathological burden of A? plaque deposits should meet the following criteria: (1) have high systemic bioavailability; (2) cross the BBB in sufficient quantities; (3) bind specifically to plaques with high affinity; and (4) produce local changes in tissue contrast that are detectable by MRI. Since IgG4.1 is an endogenous molecule raised from the mouse immune system, its fragment, F(ab?)24.1 or covalently modified F(ab?)24.1, is expected to be stable in vivo with high systemic bioavailability. In addition, removal of the Fc portion from IgG4.1 will also minimize the risks associated with the inflammatory response and cerebral hemorrhaging as reported in active and some passive immunotherapy studies ( 26 ). Also, because of the larger molecular size, internalization of this probe by cells in the brain parenchyma is expected to be limited so that most of the probe should be available for imaging the amyloid plaques in the extracellular milieu. The use of the cyclic Gd-DOTA chelating complex, which has greater stability compared to the noncyclic Gd-DTPA chelating complex, will allow the tight chelation of Gd to minimize the release of any toxic free Gd ions in vivo ( 17 ). When injected intravenously in WT mice, pF(ab?)24.1 was cleared from the systemic circulation more rapidly compared to F(ab?)24.1 ( Fig. 3A ) and primarily accumulated in kidney and liver. The plasma pharmacokinetics of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 revealed some interesting trends. The plasma residence time of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 was significantly higher than that of pF(ab?24.1. In addition Gd-DOTA- pF(ab?)24.1 showed decreased accumulation in the kidney and liver compare to pF(ab?)24.1 and even F(ab?)24.1 ( Fig. 3B ). These pharmacokinetic features are characteristic of cationized proteins, such as, rapid elimination from the systemic circulation and significant distribution to tissues, which adds to the safety of the contrast agent, because it has been reported cationized proteins that rapidly accumulate in the kidney pose potential renal toxicity ( 27 , 28 ). Based on the ELISA, the binding epitopes of F(ab?)24.1 were largely preserved during the synthesis of Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1 by employing careful conditions used for the two step carbodiimide reaction. The binding of Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1 to A? fibrils is comparable to that of the whole antibody IgG4.1 and IgG4G8 when a Fab specific secondary antibody was used in the ELISA experiment, but somewhat less than that of native F(ab?)24.1. Similar effects were also observed in the in vitro binding experiments of radioiodinated Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1, which showed somewhat fewer silver grains compared to the radioiodinated F(ab?)24.1 with APP/PS1 mouse brain slices. However, when radioiodinated Gd- DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 was injected intravenously into APP/PS1 mice, it labels amyloid plaques in vivo in different regions of the cortex and hippocampus. This labeling was highly specific to amyloid plaques, whereas radioiodinated nonspecific IgG label was only found in blood vessels and not the amyloid plaques. The in vivo labeling of radioiodinated Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1 clearly demonstrated that it crossed the BBB and labeled amyloid plaques present in the APP/PS1 brain parenchyma. Furthermore, incubation of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 with the brain slices of an APP mouse followed by MRI showed selective enhancement of plaques on the T 1-weighted spin echo MR image. Contrast-enhanced amyloid plaques were visible throughout the cortex and hippocampus of the brain. Many of the bright spots seen in the T 1SE MR image, which are from the T 1 relaxation of Gd present in the contrast agent, are matched with the dark spots of T 2SE MR image of the same brain slice. Previously Poduslo et al. ( 6 ) demonstrated that the dark spots observed in T 2SE images of AD mouse brain were spatially co-registered with Thioflavin S-positive amyloid plaques. These experiments demonstrate that Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 binds to amyloid plaques and the chelated Gd through the covalent linkage of DOTA shows plaque-specific selective contrast enhancement in T 1SE image This is not the first report of using antibodies as imaging agents to detect amyloid plaques. Majocha et al. ( 29 ) developed a murine monoclonal antibody against the first 28 amino acids of the A? peptide for the potential imaging of amyloid angiopathy in AD. They enzymatically cleaved the antibody to Fab fragments and labeled it with 99mTc for in vitro autoradiography assessment after incubation with AD brain sections. These Fab fragments labeled amyloid present in the blood vessels of AD brain slices under in vitro condition. Further development of the probe for in vivo studies were not possible because it did not cross the BBB ( 30 ). Lee et al. ( 31 ) developed a rat monoclonal antibody against mouse transferrin receptor that was complexed to radioiodinated A?40 using the metabolically stabile biotin-streptavidin linkage. The intent here was to use the transferrin receptor at the BBB to deliver A?, which would bind to the amyloid plaques. Subsequent ex vivo autoradiographic analysis of AD mouse brain slices suggested bulk tissue enhancement of this complex with the whole brain slice showing extensive silver grain deposition. No mention was made of animal perfusion after IV injection, so it is not clear how successful this antibody complex was delivered across the BBB. The inability to cross the BBB in sufficient quantities could be a major limitation for the failure of these probes to be used as a putative contrast agent. While polyamine modification of macromolecules to increase the permeability at the BBB has been our strategy, other promising approaches were also reported in the literature. Recently, Kumar et al. ( 32 ) successfully targeted siRNA to the brain neuronal cells across the BBB using a short peptide derived from rabies viral glycoprotein coupled with nine arginine (positively charged) residues. Several positively charged cell-penetrating peptides covalently coupled with protein were also used to enable as a cargo to cross the BBB [see review Patel et al. ( 33 )]. In another study, Boado et al. ( 34 ) developed a trifunctional fusion protein with three functionalities. The first one is the engineered mono-clonal antibody against the human insulin receptor which triggers the receptor mediated transcytosis from blood to brain across the BBB, the second one is engineered single chain variable fragments from antibody raised against the A? peptide—to bind and disaggregate the amyloid plaques of AD. The third functionality is Fc receptor of human antibody to cause the reverse transcytosis. While the mechanism of each delivery could be different, the successful brain delivery largely relies on targeting drugs in sufficient quantities across the BBB. Those limits could be higher for a diagnostic probe and may be lower for the therapeutic probe. About 30–40 fold increase in the permeability of polyamine modified macromolecules at the BBB may be closer to the minimum threshold limit to see some positive physiological response. Additionally to validate this molecular probe as a potential MRI contrast agent to detect AD in live animals or patients depends on several other factors, including optimizing the pharmacokinetics and delivery routes of Gd- DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 administration to increase its bioavailability; evaluating the minimum dosage required for amyloid plaque detection; and developing improved MRI pulse sequences to image contrast enhanced plaques in vivo . This study highlights the potential of the polyamine modification, which mediates the delivery of radioiodinated Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1 to the AD mice brain across the BBB as demon- strated by in vivo immunohistochemistry. The molecular probe also binds to amyloid plaques and shows a selective amyloid plaque specific contrast enhancement in T 1SE MR image under in vitro conditions. In principle, the delivery approach described here might also be applicable to the delivery of other diagnostic or therapeutic proteins for various neurological disorders.  DISCUSSION The present studies demonstrates that Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1 showed nearly 30 fold increase in BBB permeability compared to the unmodified F(ab?)24.1, binds specifically to amyloid plaques, and produces local changes in tissue contrast enhancement with APP transgenic mouse brain slices that are detectable by MRI.

The use of the cyclic Gd-DOTA chelating complex, which has greater stability compared to the noncyclic Gd-DTPA chelating complex, will allow the tight chelation of Gd to minimize the release of any toxic free Gd ions in vivo ( 17 ). When injected intravenously in WT mice, pF(ab?)24.1 was cleared from the systemic circulation more rapidly compared to F(ab?)24.1 ( Fig. 3A ) and primarily accumulated in kidney and liver. The plasma pharmacokinetics of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 revealed some interesting trends. The plasma residence time of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 was significantly higher than that of pF(ab?24.1. In addition Gd-DOTA- pF(ab?)24.1 showed decreased accumulation in the kidney and liver compare to pF(ab?)24.1 and even F(ab?)24.1 ( Fig. 3B ). These pharmacokinetic features are characteristic of cationized proteins, such as, rapid elimination from the systemic circulation and significant distribution to tissues, which adds to the safety of the contrast agent, because it has been reported cationized proteins that rapidly accumulate in the kidney pose potential renal toxicity ( 27 , 28 ). Based on the ELISA, the binding epitopes of F(ab?)24.1 were largely preserved during the synthesis of Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1 by employing careful conditions used for the two step carbodiimide reaction. The binding of Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1 to A? fibrils is comparable to that of the whole antibody IgG4.1 and IgG4G8 when a Fab specific secondary antibody was used in the ELISA experiment, but somewhat less than that of native F(ab?)24.1. Similar effects were also observed in the in vitro binding experiments of radioiodinated Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1, which showed somewhat fewer silver grains compared to the radioiodinated F(ab?)24.1 with APP/PS1 mouse brain slices. However, when radioiodinated Gd- DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 was injected intravenously into APP/PS1 mice, it labels amyloid plaques in vivo in different regions of the cortex and hippocampus. This labeling was highly specific to amyloid plaques, whereas radioiodinated nonspecific IgG label was only found in blood vessels and not the amyloid plaques. The in vivo labeling of radioiodinated Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1 clearly demonstrated that it crossed the BBB and labeled amyloid plaques present in the APP/PS1 brain parenchyma. Furthermore, incubation of Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 with the brain slices of an APP mouse followed by MRI showed selective enhancement of plaques on the T 1-weighted spin echo MR image. Contrast-enhanced amyloid plaques were visible throughout the cortex and hippocampus of the brain. Many of the bright spots seen in the T 1SE MR image, which are from the T 1 relaxation of Gd present in the contrast agent, are matched with the dark spots of T 2SE MR image of the same brain slice. Previously Poduslo et al. ( 6 ) demonstrated that the dark spots observed in T 2SE images of AD mouse brain were spatially co-registered with Thioflavin S-positive amyloid plaques. These experiments demonstrate that Gd-DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 binds to amyloid plaques and the chelated Gd through the covalent linkage of DOTA shows plaque-specific selective contrast enhancement in T 1SE image This is not the first report of using antibodies as imaging agents to detect amyloid plaques. Majocha et al. ( 29 ) developed a murine monoclonal antibody against the first 28 amino acids of the A? peptide for the potential imaging of amyloid angiopathy in AD. They enzymatically cleaved the antibody to Fab fragments and labeled it with 99mTc for in vitro autoradiography assessment after incubation with AD brain sections. These Fab fragments labeled amyloid present in the blood vessels of AD brain slices under in vitro condition. Further development of the probe for in vivo studies were not possible because it did not cross the BBB ( 30 ). Lee et al. ( 31 ) developed a rat monoclonal antibody against mouse transferrin receptor that was complexed to radioiodinated A?40 using the metabolically stabile biotin-streptavidin linkage. The intent here was to use the transferrin receptor at the BBB to deliver A?, which would bind to the amyloid plaques. Subsequent ex vivo autoradiographic analysis of AD mouse brain slices suggested bulk tissue enhancement of this complex with the whole brain slice showing extensive silver grain deposition. No mention was made of animal perfusion after IV injection, so it is not clear how successful this antibody complex was delivered across the BBB. The inability to cross the BBB in sufficient quantities could be a major limitation for the failure of these probes to be used as a putative contrast agent. While polyamine modification of macromolecules to increase the permeability at the BBB has been our strategy, other promising approaches were also reported in the literature. Recently, Kumar et al. ( 32 ) successfully targeted siRNA to the brain neuronal cells across the BBB using a short peptide derived from rabies viral glycoprotein coupled with nine arginine (positively charged) residues. Several positively charged cell-penetrating peptides covalently coupled with protein were also used to enable as a cargo to cross the BBB [see review Patel et al. ( 33 )]. In another study, Boado et al. ( 34 ) developed a trifunctional fusion protein with three functionalities. The first one is the engineered mono-clonal antibody against the human insulin receptor which triggers the receptor mediated transcytosis from blood to brain across the BBB, the second one is engineered single chain variable fragments from antibody raised against the A? peptide—to bind and disaggregate the amyloid plaques of AD. The third functionality is Fc receptor of human antibody to cause the reverse transcytosis. While the mechanism of each delivery could be different, the successful brain delivery largely relies on targeting drugs in sufficient quantities across the BBB. Those limits could be higher for a diagnostic probe and may be lower for the therapeutic probe. About 30–40 fold increase in the permeability of polyamine modified macromolecules at the BBB may be closer to the minimum threshold limit to see some positive physiological response. Additionally to validate this molecular probe as a potential MRI contrast agent to detect AD in live animals or patients depends on several other factors, including optimizing the pharmacokinetics and delivery routes of Gd- DOTA-pF(ab?)24.1 administration to increase its bioavailability; evaluating the minimum dosage required for amyloid plaque detection; and developing improved MRI pulse sequences to image contrast enhanced plaques in vivo . This study highlights the potential of the polyamine modification, which mediates the delivery of radioiodinated Gd-DOTA-pF (ab?)24.1 to the AD mice brain across the BBB as demon- strated by in vivo immunohistochemistry. The molecular probe also binds to amyloid plaques and shows a selective amyloid plaque specific contrast enhancement in T 1SE MR image under in vitro conditions. In principle, the delivery approach described here might also be applicable to the delivery of other diagnostic or therapeutic proteins for various neurological disorders.
