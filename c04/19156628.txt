Is Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Lipoprotein Subclass related to Diabetic Retinopathy? The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Objective To examine associations between nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) defined lipoproteins and diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a population-based sample of adults with type 2 diabetes. Research Design and Methods 921 persons with diabetes in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) were included. DR was assessed from retinal photographs. Lipoproteins were measured by NMR spectroscopy. Results After controlling for age, race/ethnicity, study center and diabetes and vascular risk factors, no consistent patterns of associations between NMR defined lipoprotein particle concentrations and subclass with DR were evident. Conclusion The lack of association between NMR defined lipoproteins and DR does not support clinical use of NMR spectroscopy for management of patients with DR.
