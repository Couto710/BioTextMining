BK Virus and Human Cancer: Innocent until Proven Guilty BK virus (BKV) is a polyomavirus that ubiquitously infects the human population. Following a typically subclinical primary infection, BKV establishes a lifelong persistent infection in the kidney and urinary tract. BKV is known to reactivate and cause severe disease in immunosuppressed patients, particularly renal and bone marrow transplant patients. Infection of BKV in rodent animal models or cells in culture often results in tumor formation or transformation, respectively. When co-expressed with activated oncogenes, BKV large tumor antigen drives the transformation of primary human cells. An etiological role of BKV in human cancer, however, remains controversial. Multiple reports have demonstrated conflicting results in regards to the presence of BKV sequences and/or proteins in various tumor types. This review compiles the most recent findings of BKV detection in a number of human cancers. Due to the lack of conclusive causality data from these studies, there does not appear to be a definitive association between BKV and human cancers.  Conclusions The clinical studies described above have demonstrated both the presence and absence of BKV sequences in cancerous tissues. As a member of the polyomavirus family, it can be stated that BKV has all the qualifications to be a cofactor in the induction and/or progression of human tumors. A causal role for BKV in human neoplasia, however, still remains to be established. There are several concerns when considering a role for BKV in carcinogenesis: (a) BKV DNA sequences are often found in normal human tissues, thus whole tumor samples must be carefully examined because they contain both normal and tumor cells; (b) the expression of TAg, the viral protein that drives transformation, is infrequently analyzed and reported in cancerous tissues; (c) the inability of BKV to replicate in animal models severely restricts key studies relating to causality; (d) epidemiological studies are impaired by the presence of BKV in nearly the entire population, thus the design of more quantitative studies may help define the role, if any, of BKV in cancer. Due to these concerns, it is very difficult to apply classical Koch’s postulates to BKV [ 145 ]. An alternative set of criteria to define an oncogenic role for viruses in humans has been proposed: (a) epidemiological and clinical evidence that a viral infection puts one at risk for tumor development; (b) presence of the nucleic acid and/or the expression of viral proteins in specific tumor cells; (c) induction of cell transformation or immortalization upon transfection of either the viral genome or its individual sub domains; and (d) demonstration that the phenotypic characteristics of the tumor and the changes caused in cultured cells from the tumor are dependent on the expression of viral proteins [ 146 – 151 ]. Future investigations should be aimed at achieving more consistent detection of BKV DNA and TAg in human tumor samples, developing an animal model that accurately mimics BKV persistent infection and reactivation, and determining whether BKV transitions from a benign persistent pathogen to a virulent infectious agent that causes cancer.

The solid arrows indicate open reading frames and the dashed lines are early region introns. Transcription of the early and late regions proceeds in the direction of the arrows.
