Enteric infection meets intestinal function: how bacterial pathogens cause diarrhoea Infectious diarrhoea is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide. In bacterium-induced diarrhoea, rapid loss of fluids and electrolytes results from inhibition of the normal absorptive function of the intestine as well as the activation of secretory processes. Advances in the past 10 years in the fields of gastrointestinal physiology, innate immunity and enteric bacterial virulence mechanisms highlight the multifactorial nature of infectious diarrhoea. This Review explores the various mechanisms that contribute to loss of fluids and electrolytes following bacterial infections, and attempts to link these events to specific virulence factors and toxins.  Conclusion Recent advances in genomics and proteomics have made the identification of bacterial virulence factors considerably easier. Moreover, the experimental tools to evaluate the composition of the intestinal micro-biome and its contribution to health and disease are now available. Also, recent studies on innate immunity and epithelial integrity highlight the complexity of intestinal function. Bacterium-induced diarrhoea is multifactorial. The challenge for the future, therefore, is to understand the interplay between different aspects of intestinal physiology, such as the relationship between inflammation and secretion, and the connection between tight junctions and secretion. In the past 2 decades, research on bacterial toxins has proved instrumental in developing an understanding of normal intestinal function. For example, study of the heat-stable enterotoxins of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli led to the discovery of endogenous mammalian ligands of guanylyl cyclase 88 . Unravelling how newly identified bacterial virulence factors function will also provide insights into intestinal physiology and new therapeutic approaches for the management of diarrhoea.
