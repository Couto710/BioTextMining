Application and Implementation of Selective Tissue Microdissection and Proteomic Profiling in Neurological Disease OBJECTIVE Proteins are the primary components of cells and are vital constituents of any living organism. The proteins that make up an organism (proteome) are constantly changing and are intricately linked to neurological disease processes. The study of proteins, or proteomics, is a relatively new but rapidly expanding field with increasing relevance to neurosurgery. METHODS We present a review of the state-of-the-art proteomic technology and its applications in central nervous system diseases. RESULTS The technique of “selective microdissection” allows an investigator to selectively isolate and study a pathological tissue of interest. By evaluating protein expression in a variety of central nervous system disorders, it is clear that proteins are differentially expressed across disease states, and protein expression changes markedly during disease progression. CONCLUSION Understanding the patterns of protein expression in the nervous system has critical implications for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disease. As gatekeepers in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of central nervous system diseases, it is important for neurosurgeons to develop an appreciation for proteomic techniques and their utility.  CONCLUSIONS Proteomic investigations are well suited for the investigation of neurological diseases. The large-scale screening capacity of proteomic technology has allowed the observation of differential expression of many proteins that were previously not linked to a given disease. Ultimately, these data may lead to new molecular mechanisms and treatment approaches for these disorders. This integrative knowledge will facilitate the development of more specific diagnostic markers and neuropharmaceutical agents to treat neurological disorders.
