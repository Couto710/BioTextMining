True Aneurysmal Dilatation of a Contegra Conduit after Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Reconstruction: A Novel Mechanism of Conduit Failure  Comment Aneurysmal dilatation of the Contegra conduit (Medtronic Inc) has been rarely reported [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. When identified, it is usually confined to the proximal anastomosis (pseudoaneurysm) and is commonly associated with distal anastomotic stenosis [ 4 ]. In our patient, true aneurysmal dilatation of the 14-mm unsupported Contegra device was observed in the setting of elevated pulmonary artery pressure, but without evidence for distal conduit or branch pulmonary artery stenosis. The mechanism(s) of failure are unknown, but mechanical stress and/or immunologic factors could be involved [ 5 ]. However, this generalized dilatation of the conduit is rare and may represent a new means of failure related to the Contegra graft. Close follow-up on this device in patients is warranted.
