Current State of Motor Cortex and deep brain stimulation for the treatment of intractable neuropathic face pain Intractable neuropathic face pain is a syndrome of unremitting severe pain that stems from abnormal nociceptive processing at various levels of the trigeminal system. Treatment of this debilitating condition has long presented a challenge for physicians due to the refractoriness to standard pharmacologic therapies. With few viable treatment options available surgical procedures such motor cortex stimulation (MCS) and Deep brain stimulation (DBS) provide additional treatment options. The authors present a review of the current literature and practices regarding patient selection criteria, potential mechanism of action, surgical technique, and outcome of patients with neuropathic face pain treated with MCS and DBS.  Conclusion The results of MCS and DBS as treatment for intractable neuropathic face pain are variable, but promising. Many important questions remain regarding these techniques. A major issue is a lack of standardized and accepted pre- and post-operative evaluation, and defined inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection. The surgical technique varies from institution to institution and a consensus is yet to be reached on factors such as optimal electrode placement and stimulation parameters. Given the dire nature of intractable neuropathic face pain, the lack of effective therapy, and reported efficacy of neuromodulation surgery, it is reasonable to continue to offer DBS or MCS in the carefully chosen patient.
