Chronic kidney disease as an under-recognized threat to patient safety Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, but under-recognized, among patients in the health care system, where improving patient safety is a high priority. Poor disease recognition and several other features of CKD make it a high risk condition for adverse safety events. In this review, we will discuss the unique attributes of CKD, which make it a high risk condition for patient safety mishaps. We will point out that adverse safety events in this disease have the potential to contribute to disease progression; namely, accelerated loss of kidney function and an increased incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We will also propose a framework in which to consider patient safety in CKD, highlighting the need for disease-specific safety indicators that reflect unsafe practices in this disease. Finally, we will discuss the hypothesis that increased recognition of CKD will reduce disease-specific safety events, and in this way decrease the likelihood of adverse outcomes including an accelerated rate of kidney function loss and an increased incidence of ESRD.
