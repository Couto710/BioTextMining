Characterization of Obese Phenotypes in a small Nonhuman Primate, the Common Marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ) This report explores aspects of developing obesity in two captive populations of common marmosets ( Callithrix jacchus ), a small primate with a short lifespan that may be of value in modeling chronic aspects of obesity acquisition and its lifetime effects. Two populations were examined. In study 1, body composition, lipid parameters, and glucose metabolic parameters were measured in a population of 64 adult animals. Animals classified as obese (>80th percentile relative fat based on sex) displayed both dyslipidemia (higher triglyceride and very low–density lipoprotein (VLDL)) and altered glucose metabolism (higher fasting glucose and HbA1c). Using operational definitions of atypical values for factors associated with metabolic syndrome in humans, five subjects (7.8%) had at least three atypical factors and five others had two atypical factors. A previously unreported finding in these normally sexually monomorphic primates was higher body weight, fat weights, and percent fat in females compared to males. In a second study, longitudinal weight data for a larger population ( n = 210) were analyzed to evaluate the development of high weight animals. Differences in weights for animals that would exceed the 90th percentile in early adulthood were evident from infancy, with a 15% difference in weight between future-large weight vs. their future-normal weight litter mates as early as 4–6 months of age. The marmoset, therefore, demonstrates similar suites of obesity-related alterations to those seen in other primates, including humans, suggesting that this species is worthy of consideration for obesity studies in which its fast maturity, high fertility, relatively short lifespan, and small size may be of advantage.  Results Study 1 Table 1 provides descriptive statistics on the first population. Females were significantly older, on average than males and had significantly higher body weights, fat weight, and relative proportion of fat. These sex differences in body fat appear to be age-independent. With age as a covariate, sex differences remained significant at P < 0.009 to P < 0.0001. As an example of the age-independence of these sex differences in body fat, Table 1 also provides descriptive statistics for a subset of the population that includes only individuals between 3.5 and 5.5 years of age, an age range at which adult marmosets have reached a stable weight and are not yet displaying age-related weight decline ( 23 ). In this subset of individuals, males and females do not differ in age, yet the same sex differences in fat weight ( t = 2.24, P = 0.035) and relative fat ( t = 2.10, P = 0.048) are observed. Because lean weight did not differ between males and females, females had on average, 36% more relative fat than males. Glucose metabolism variables were all significantly correlated with each other at P < 0.001 (plasma glucose × glucometer = 0.912; plasma glucose × HbA1c = 0.509; glucometer × HbA1c = 0.461). Lipid parameters were correlated as follows: cholesterol was positively correlated with HDL (0.485), LDL (0.574), and VLDL (0.594) at P < 0.001; triglyceride was negatively correlated with LDL (?0.277, P < 0.03) and VLDL (?0.797, P < 0.001). Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for the obese (defined as a relative fat exceeding the 80th percentile) vs. nonobese animals in this population. Animals classified as obese did not differ from nonobese in age, lean weight, cholesterol, LDL, or HDL, but had significantly higher fat weight, fasting glucose, HbA1c, VLDL, and triglyceride concentrations. Out of 64 subjects, 28 (43.75%) had at least one variable that met the operational definitions of atypical metabolic syndrome risk factors (see Table 3 ). Of these 28 subjects, 64.3% ( n = 18) had only one atypical factor, 17.8% ( n = 5) had two, 14.3% ( n = 4) had three, and 1 (3.6%) had four atypical factors, The most common risk factor was an elevated glucose metabolism parameter (either elevated fasting glucose concentration or elevated HbA1c); however, this variable was also the one least likely to be associated with others. Elevated triglyceride concentration was always associated with at least one other atypical factor and, in five of six cases, was associated with two or three additional factors—i.e., meeting the metabolic syndrome definition if these operationally defined factors translate into risks similar to those seen in humans. Study 2 The population in study 2 offered the opportunity to examine sex differences in weights for a larger population of males and females that were reared in the same colony and could be examined at the same age. Sex differences in early adult weight in study 2 mirrored those seen in study 1—females were significantly larger than males (mean ± s.e. for females = 395.10 ± 8.92 g; for males = 365.82 ± 5.92 g; F = 7.47, P < 0.007). It is possible that this sex difference in weight reflected a difference in overall body size, rather than a specific difference in body fat. Because we did not have measurements of body dimensions or quantification of lean vs. fat weight for this population, we were unable to address this question directly. We were able, a posteriori , to obtain weight and knee-heel length measurements in four male–female litters, ranging from 2.5 to 4.5 years of age, in which the female adult weight exceeded that of the male litter mate (female mean = 401.25 ± 73.4 vs. male mean = 369.0 ± 58.6 g). Although the females were significantly heavier than their male litter mates (paired t = 3.316, P = 0.052), their knee-heel lengths did not differ (female = 72.4 ± 1.54; male = 74.6 ± 1.0 mm; paired t = ?1.84, P = 0.163), suggesting that the females were not likely larger in body length than were their male litter mates. Figure 1 illustrates the early adult weights of all animals relative to their sequential birth order within the colony. In the early period of colony development, early adult weights were increasing linearly and were similar between males and females. However, once early adult weights began to stabilize, female weights were significantly higher than male weights. Early adult weight (17–24 months of age) was significantly related to birth weight in females, but not in males ( Figure 2 ). Individuals who exceeded the 90th percentile in early adult weight were significantly larger than those that did not at 0, 2, 4, and 6 months of age (birth F = 9.854, P < 0.004; 2 months F = 12.77, P < 0.001; 4 months F = 13.45, P <0.001; 6 months F = 12.96, P < 0.001; see Table 4 ). The difference at birth, although statistically significant, was quite small (3%). The percent differences increased over infancy to ?15%. The difference in early adulthood was 33.9%. Ten obese individuals had a litter mate—in only one case (one female–female litter) did both litter members exceed the 90th percentile in weight at early adulthood. Figure 3 illustrates the within-litter weight differences at 2–6 months for six male–female litters and three female–female litters in which at least one litter member exceeded the 90th percentile in early adulthood. Females litter mates tended to have similar growth trajectories, even if they differentiated in weight postinfancy, while males in male–female litters had a lower growth slope in infancy than did their sisters. There was no female–male litter in which the male exceeded the female in early infant growth or in early adult weight. These growth patterns resulted in an average early adult weight difference between female litter mates of 35 g ( n = 3, range 20–60) vs. an average difference of 98.3 g ( n = 6, range 43–162) between female–male litter mates.

Females litter mates tended to have similar growth trajectories, even if they differentiated in weight postinfancy, while males in male–female litters had a lower growth slope in infancy than did their sisters. There was no female–male litter in which the male exceeded the female in early infant growth or in early adult weight. These growth patterns resulted in an average early adult weight difference between female litter mates of 35 g ( n = 3, range 20–60) vs. an average difference of 98.3 g ( n = 6, range 43–162) between female–male litter mates.

Discussion The results of these studies indicate that marmoset monkeys, in common with macaques ( 8 – 11 , 13 ), baboons ( 12 ), and vervet monkeys ( 14 ), spontaneously develop high body weight and high relative fat concentrations in captivity. The causes of the secular trend of increased body weight in marmosets (19, this study) have not been determined. The basic forms of caging and husbandry has remained the same throughout this colony's history. The population described in study 2 was maintained on the same base diets until 2006 when we switched from the ZuPreem to the Purina Mazuri base diet (reflecting changes in weaning and early adult diet for births numbered ?520—see Figure 2 ), while continuing to feed the purified diet throughout. No striking change in adult weights, growth rates, or body composition was noted in association with this change. A previously unreported finding in this species was the sex differences in propensity to develop large body weight and higher relative fat weight—i.e., to become overweight or obese. Marmosets are generally described as sexually monomorphic in terms of body size. We previously reported no sex differences in fat weight (estimated by deuterium- oxide-labeled water dilution) relative to lean weight or total body weight in a sample of 20 subjects, representative of the adult population from the early years of the Southwest National Primate Research Center breeding colony ( 26 ). Though fat and lean estimation methods differed in the two studies, a comparison of ( 26 ) and study 1 of this paper suggests that trends in larger body mass and fat mass in marmosets show a striking sex difference. Average male weight was 6.0% higher and fat mass did not differ between the two studies. In contrast, average female weight was 28.7% higher in study 1 than in ref. 26 and fat weight was increased by 141% (22.99–55.48 g). There was no sex difference in lean weight in ref. 26 or in this study. Therefore, female marmosets, in common with many other mammals including humans and other nonhuman primates show a higher propensity than males to store fat, but males marmosets do not show the lean weight sex difference often seen in other species—i.e., males having higher absolute lean weight. Growth data suggest that sex differences in propensity to obesity begin early in life. Female birth weight was significantly related to adult size but this was not true for males. A sex difference in relative fat preceding puberty has been frequently described in humans (e.g., refs. 37 – 42 but see refs. 43 – 45 ). Future studies will determine the extent to which these early life weight differences in the marmoset reflect lean vs. fat weight accumulation. Although no systematic examination of neonatal body composition in marmosets has been conducted, studies from other nonhuman primates ( 46 ) as well as our anecdotal findings from necropsy of stillborn, normal weight marmoset infants suggests that marmoset neonates are unlikely to have large stores of body fat. Humans are unusual among primates in terms of having substantial amounts of adipose tissue at birth ( 46 ). Exploring how rapidly marmoset infants accumulate adipose tissue following birth and the variance in that trait is part of an ongoing project in our laboratory. In study 1, animals classified as obese had altered lipid parameters (higher triglyceride and VLDL) and altered glucose metabolism (higher HbA1c, indicating a higher degree of ongoing hyperglycemia). Using our operationally defined risk factors, 7.8% of subjects fit the ATP III definition of metabolic syndrome, with at least three risk factors. An additional 7.8% had two risk factors. We were unable in this study to monitor blood pressure, a factor that we will add to future studies. Also of interest in future studies is to determine whether or not exposure to higher caloric density diets will increase the percentage of subjects meeting this operational definition of metabolic syndrome. Fasting glucose (168 mg/dl) in nonobese subjects was high compared to larger-bodied primates but similar to values previously reported for marmosets ( 47 , 48 ). The fact that high fasting glucose was the single variable most likely to occur without association with any other atypical values, suggests that some of these glucose concentrations may be elevated in response to stress due to capture or handling; however, similar average values are reported for sedated and unsedated marmosets ( 47 ). HbA1c and fasting glucose concentrations are significantly positively correlated, suggesting that fasting glucose concentration may still be a valid measure of hyperglycemia. In summary, the marmoset demonstrates the similar suites of body composition, glucose metabolism alterations and lipid alterations as are seen in other nonhuman primates and in humans, suggesting that this species is worthy of consideration for obesity studies in which its fast maturity, high fertility, relatively short lifespan, and small size may be of advantage. Marmoset twins offer the opportunity to have >1 infant exposed to the same uterine and postnatal family environments. Future studies may also take advantage of the fact that the infants are easily fostered between parents.

We previously reported no sex differences in fat weight (estimated by deuterium- oxide-labeled water dilution) relative to lean weight or total body weight in a sample of 20 subjects, representative of the adult population from the early years of the Southwest National Primate Research Center breeding colony ( 26 ). Though fat and lean estimation methods differed in the two studies, a comparison of ( 26 ) and study 1 of this paper suggests that trends in larger body mass and fat mass in marmosets show a striking sex difference. Average male weight was 6.0% higher and fat mass did not differ between the two studies. In contrast, average female weight was 28.7% higher in study 1 than in ref. 26 and fat weight was increased by 141% (22.99–55.48 g). There was no sex difference in lean weight in ref. 26 or in this study. Therefore, female marmosets, in common with many other mammals including humans and other nonhuman primates show a higher propensity than males to store fat, but males marmosets do not show the lean weight sex difference often seen in other species—i.e., males having higher absolute lean weight. Growth data suggest that sex differences in propensity to obesity begin early in life. Female birth weight was significantly related to adult size but this was not true for males. A sex difference in relative fat preceding puberty has been frequently described in humans (e.g., refs. 37 – 42 but see refs. 43 – 45 ). Future studies will determine the extent to which these early life weight differences in the marmoset reflect lean vs. fat weight accumulation. Although no systematic examination of neonatal body composition in marmosets has been conducted, studies from other nonhuman primates ( 46 ) as well as our anecdotal findings from necropsy of stillborn, normal weight marmoset infants suggests that marmoset neonates are unlikely to have large stores of body fat. Humans are unusual among primates in terms of having substantial amounts of adipose tissue at birth ( 46 ). Exploring how rapidly marmoset infants accumulate adipose tissue following birth and the variance in that trait is part of an ongoing project in our laboratory. In study 1, animals classified as obese had altered lipid parameters (higher triglyceride and VLDL) and altered glucose metabolism (higher HbA1c, indicating a higher degree of ongoing hyperglycemia). Using our operationally defined risk factors, 7.8% of subjects fit the ATP III definition of metabolic syndrome, with at least three risk factors. An additional 7.8% had two risk factors. We were unable in this study to monitor blood pressure, a factor that we will add to future studies. Also of interest in future studies is to determine whether or not exposure to higher caloric density diets will increase the percentage of subjects meeting this operational definition of metabolic syndrome. Fasting glucose (168 mg/dl) in nonobese subjects was high compared to larger-bodied primates but similar to values previously reported for marmosets ( 47 , 48 ). The fact that high fasting glucose was the single variable most likely to occur without association with any other atypical values, suggests that some of these glucose concentrations may be elevated in response to stress due to capture or handling; however, similar average values are reported for sedated and unsedated marmosets ( 47 ). HbA1c and fasting glucose concentrations are significantly positively correlated, suggesting that fasting glucose concentration may still be a valid measure of hyperglycemia. In summary, the marmoset demonstrates the similar suites of body composition, glucose metabolism alterations and lipid alterations as are seen in other nonhuman primates and in humans, suggesting that this species is worthy of consideration for obesity studies in which its fast maturity, high fertility, relatively short lifespan, and small size may be of advantage. Marmoset twins offer the opportunity to have >1 infant exposed to the same uterine and postnatal family environments. Future studies may also take advantage of the fact that the infants are easily fostered between parents.
