Mycobacterial clearance from sputum is delayed during the first phase of treatment in patients with diabetes Though Type 2 diabetes (DM) is a recognized risk factor for development of tuberculosis (TB), the impact on treatment is unclear. Among the few published reports, some suggest that mycobacterial clearance during treatment is delayed in TB patients with DM. Using survival analysis on data from 469 culture-positive TB patients retrospectively identified in South Texas, we found DM to be an independent risk factor for a five-day delay in mycobacterial clearance within the first 60 days of treatment.
