C-MYC overexpression is required for continuous suppression of oncogene-induced senescence in melanoma cells Malignant melanomas often harbor activating mutations in BRAF (V600E) or, less frequently, in NRAS (Q61R). Intriguingly, the same mutations have been detected at higher incidences in benign nevi, which are largely composed of senescent melanocytes. Overexpression of BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R in human melanocytes in vitro has been shown to induce senescence, although via different mechanisms. How oncogene-induced senescence is overcome during melanoma progression remains unclear. Here, we report that in the majority of analysed BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-expressing melanoma cells, C-MYC depletion induced different yet overlapping sets of senescence phenotypes that are characteristic of normal melanocytes undergoing senescence due to overexpression of BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R, respectively. These senescence phenotypes were p16INK4A- or p53-independent, however, several of them were suppressed by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of BRAFV600E or phosphoino-sitide 3-kinase pathways, including rapamycin-mediated inhibition of mTOR-raptor in NRASQ61R-expressing melanoma cells. Reciprocally, overexpression of C-MYC in normal melanocytes suppressed BRAFV600E-induced senescence more efficiently than NRASQ61R-induced senescence, which agrees with the generally higher rates of activating mutations in BRAF than NRAS gene in human cutaneous melanomas. Our data suggest that one of the major functions of C-MYC overexpression in melanoma progression is to continuous suppress BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-dependent senescence programs.  Materials and methods Cell lines Melanoma cell lines were originally obtained from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's essential minimal medium as recommended by the supplier. Supplements included fetal calf serum (10%), 2m m glutamine, and 100 U/ml penicillin G+100 ?g/ml streptomycin. All cell culture agents were purchased from Invitrogen Inc. (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Normal melanocytes were isolated from neonatal foreskins as reported before ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ) and maintained in Medium 254 supplemented with 0.2m m CaCl2, 16n m TPA and melanocyte growth factors (Invitrogen, Portland, OR, USA). Senescence assay Cells were plated in 12-well plates at 30% confluence 2 days prior to the assay. Cells were fixed and incubated for different time periods (4 h to overnight, depending on the cell line) at 37 °C with the staining solution containing the X-Gal substrate (BioVision, Mountain View, CA, USA). The development of blue color was detected visually under the microscope. siRNA and shRNA Control and BRAFV600E-specific siRNAs ( Sharma et al. , 2005 ) were manufactured by Invitrogen and transfected according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The lentiviral vectors containing shRNA specific for p53 and p16INK4A were described by Denoyelle et al. (2006) and Wang et al. (2008) , respectively. Lentiviral vector pLKO-1 containing shRNA-1 specific for human C-MYC (C-MYC-shRNA-1) was purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). The C-MYC-targeting sequences consisted of nucleotides 1567–1585 of the previously published sequence (GenBank accession no. NM_002467.3). The lentiviral construct H1 was used to express C-MYC-shRNA-2 corresponding to nucleotides 1341–1359 of C-MYC. A control lentiviral vector contained an irrelevant sequence. Lentiviral packaging reactions were performed in the 293-FT cell line in the presence of packaging plasmids VSG and DDR ( Wang et al. , 2008 ) using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA, USA). Viral supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection, filtered through disposable 0.45 ? m cellulose acetate filters (VWR Scientific Inc., West Chester, PA, USA) and frozen in individual aliquots at ?80 °C. For infection, cells were plated in 60 or 100 mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to achieve 40–50% confluence before adding the viral supernatant in the presence of 8 ?g/ml polybrene (Sigma) for 24 h. Cells infected with C-MYC-shRNA-2 in H1 lentiviral vector were examined by fluorescence microscopy for the expression of EGFP in 48 h. Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence Frozen human tumor samples, obtained via the Tissue Procurement Service of the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, were embedded in OCT, cryosectioned and stained with hematoxylin to select the appropriate regions for use in the experiments. Typically, these specimens were large enough to obtain all of the material from a single region (for example, 2–3 mm2). The selected regions were at least 80% tumor cells (tumor cellularity), and tumors with mixed histology were not used. The tumor portions chosen for the experiments were obtained by cutting out that region of the tumor using a pointed scalpel cooled with dry ice. Protein extracts were obtained from frozen sections of melanoma tumors or benign nevi by extracting in F-buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl and 0.3% TritonX ( Nikiforov et al. , 2002 ). A total of 1 ml of F-buffer concurrently with 20 ml of liquid nitrogen was added directly to the samples followed by grinding using a pestle and a bowl. C-MYC protein levels were assessed by immunoprecipitation from approximately 300 ?g of F-buffer protein extracts with bead-conjugated monoclonal mouse C-MYC-specific antibodies (C-33; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) followed by western blotting with rabbit polyclonal C-MYC-specific antibodies (N-262, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Normalization of the amounts of samples was done by measuring the protein concentration of the extracts in colorimetric assays and verified by probing extract aliquot in western blotting with ?-tubulin antibodies. To determine the C-MYC levels in cultured cells, total cell lysates were prepared and immunoblotting was performed, as previously described, using 50 ?g of total protein ( Nikiforov et al. , 2002 ). The following antibodies were used: human C-MYC-specific C33 mouse monoclonal antibodies or N262 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p53-specific antibodies (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA), p16INK4A-specific antibodies (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA), ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, AKT-1, phospho-AKT-1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), p53R2 and p21CIP/WAF, tubulin-specific D-10 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were developed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and detection/quantification of the signal was performed using STORM PhosphorImager and ImageQuant 2.0 program. Background was calculated from an equivalent area in each lane and subtracted from the value for the protein signal in that lane. For immunofluorescence staining with antibodies specific to trimethylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), the cells were fixed and processed as previously described ( Michaloglou et al. , 2005 ).

Supplementary Material Supplementary Figures  Results C-MYC is overexpressed in melanoma metastases and in tumor-derived melanoma cells lines As an initial step in the characterization of C-MYC expression in melanocytic cells, we compared C-MYC levels in benign nevi, metastatic melanoma tissues, metastatic melanoma cell lines and cultured neonatal melanocytes. To this end, lysates from 2 benign congenital nevi and 10 melanoma metastases were subjected to immunoprecipitation with mouse C-MYC-specific antibodies, followed by western blotting with rabbit C-MYC-specific antibodies (to avoid crossreactivity) ( Figure 1a ). In parallel, C-MYC levels were determined by western blotting in total cellular extracts from 2 independently isolated populations of neonatal human melanocytes and from 10 metastasis-derived human melanoma cell lines ( Figure 1b ). As shown in Figure 1 , C-MYC protein levels were approximately three- to sevenfold higher in metastatic melanomas as compared with benign nevi. A similar increase in C-MYC levels (3- to 20-fold) was detected in samples from melanoma cell lines, when compared with normal melanocytes. These data demonstrate that C-MYC overexpression observed in cultured melanoma cells reflects upregulation of C-MYC in the course of melanoma progression and suggest that metastatic melanoma cell lines could be an adequate model for studying the functional role of C-MYC in advanced melanomas. C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells results in the induction of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>- or NRAS<sup>Q61R</sup>-dependent senescence phenotypes Recently, we demonstrated that acute and efficient short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated inhibition of C-MYC in cells from a large number of human tumor lines resulted in proliferation arrest and/or apoptosis ( Wang et al. , 2008 ). Here, we confirmed these observations for 10 melanoma cell lines using 2 C-MYC-specific shRNAs: C-MYC-shRNA-1 (M1) and C-MYC-shRNA-2 (M2). As was described previously ( Wang et al. , 2008 ), significant inhibition of C-MYC was obtained with each shRNA, although M1 suppressed C-MYC more efficiently than M2 ( Supplementary Figure S1a ). We performed expression analysis of several bona fide targets of MYC in response to its depletion in an arbitrarily chosen melanoma cell line (SK-Mel-94). As shown in Supplementary Figure S1b , expression of genes encoding cyclin B1, ornithine decarboxylase and CDC25A (positively regulated by MYC) was decreased by 2.5- to 4-fold, expression of the gene encoding p27KIP1 (suppressed by MYC) was increased by ?2-fold, whereas expression of CDK4 (positively regulated by MYC) remained virtually constant. Therefore, C-MYC depletion was accompanied by expression changes of several MYC-target genes. Depletion of C-MYC in cells from 8 out of 10 melanoma lines caused substantial reduction in proliferation rates, which eventually culminated in a complete growth arrest between days 4 and 6 ( Wang et al. , 2008 and Supplementary Figure S1c ), whereas C-MYC-depleted cells from lines UACC62 and UACC258 underwent apoptotic death shortly after infection ( Wang et al. , 2008 ; data not shown). We were interested in whether growth arrested C-MYC-depleted cells exhibit features of cellular senescence. To this end, melanoma cells infected with control or C-MYC-shRNAs were tested for the presence of well-established senescence markers: increased SA-?-Gal activity ( Itahana et al. , 2007 ) and formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci, which could be visualized by staining with DAPI and antibodies to trimethylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K93Me) ( Narita et al. , 2003 ). As shown in Figure 2b , depletion of C-MYC resulted in an approximately 7- to 10-fold increase in the percentage of SA-?-Gal-positive cells in the melanoma lines studied. Moreover, in two arbitrarily chosen BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-expressing melanoma lines, C-MYC inhibition induced an approximately three- to fivefold increase in the proportion of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci-containing cells ( Supplementary Figure S2 ). As was previously shown, transduction of activated HRAS or NRAS in normal melanocytes induces senescence that is mechanistically distinct from the one caused by BRAFV600E ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ). In particular, H-RASV12G- or NRASQ61R-expressing melanocytes became SA-?-Gal-positive, and flat and extensively vacuolized within 4–6 days after transduction, whereas, melanocytes overexpressing BRAFV600E became SA-?-Gal-positive and developed a more rounded shape without extensive vacuolization only starting 12–15 days after infection ( Figure 2a ). On the basis of these morphological differences, we noticed that C-MYC-depleted cells from melanoma lines could be segregated into two groups. Cells from the lines of the first group (SK-Mel-19, SK-Mel28, SK-Mel-29, SK-Mel-94, G-361), which express BRAFV600E ( Verhaegen et al. , 2006 ), recapitulated the senescence patterns of normal melanocytes overexpressing BRAFV600E ( Figure 2a ). In contrast, cells from the second group (SK-Mel-103, SK-Mel-147, SK-Mel-2) with NRASQ61R mutation ( Verhaegen et al. , 2006 ) resembled normal melanocytes undergoing senescence in response to the overexpression of NRASQ61R ( Figure 2a ). Therefore, our data suggest that C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells induces a cellular senescence program that is dictated by the activated oncoprotein (BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R) expressed in these cells. To determine whether senescence caused by C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells depends on constitutively active BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R, we studied the consequences of inhibiting BRAFV600E- and NRASQ61R-signaling pathways in the above cells. To this end, control and C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-94 (expressing BRAFV600E) and SK-Mel-103 (expressing NRASQ61R) cells were incubated with U0216, an inhibitor of the RAF downstream effector MEK ( Gollob et al. , 2006 ), or with LY294002 (an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), a downstream target of RAS ( Meier et al. , 2005 )). Inhibitors were added for 48 h starting at day 4 post-infection with C-MYC- or control shRNAs, that is, prior to the emergence of senescence phenotypes in C-MYC-depleted cells. Minimal effective concentrations of the inhibitors in studied melanoma cells have been established previously ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ; Verhaegen et al. , 2006 ) and were confirmed here by monitoring the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 or AKT-1 phosphorylation ( Supplementary Figure S3a ). A 48 h treatment with U0216, but not with LY294002, led to an approximately threefold decrease in the number of SA-?-Gal-positive cells in the population of C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-94 cells. Proliferation rates of control SK-Mel-94 cells were decreased by approximately 50% ( Figure 3b ), whereas proliferation of the C-MYC-depleted counterparts was unaffected, most likely because it had already been severely compromised by the absence of C-MYC. Similar results were obtained with another BRAFV600E-containing melanoma line, SK-Mel-19 (data not shown). On the other hand, treatment of C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-103 cells with U0216, while inhibiting ERK phosphorylation ( Supplementary Figure S3a ), did not affect the number of SA-?-Gal-positive and vacuolized cells ( Figure 3a ). In contrast, these phenotypes were affected by treating the cells with LY294002, as the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive and vacuolized cells decreased more than fourfold. Despite an obvious reversal of some senescence phenotypes by LY294002, the proliferation rates of C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-103 cells were not restored ( Figure 3b ), again probably owing to the absence of C-MYC expression. Similar results were obtained with another NRASQ61R-containing melanoma cell line, SK-Mel-147 (data not shown). To further confirm the involvement of activated PI3K pathway in senescence of melanoma cells, we inhibited one of the PI3K downstream effectors, mTOR-raptor ( Yang and Guan, 2007 ), in SK-Mel-103 control and MYC-depleted cells by treating them with 25 nM rapamycin ( Yang and Guan, 2007 ) for 48 h starting at day 4 post-infection. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3d , treatment with rapamycin resulted in a roughly threefold decrease in the numbers of SA-?-Gal-positive and vacuolized cells. To confirm the above data obtained via pharmacological inhibition of MEK and PI3K, we set up experiments to genetically inhibit activated BRAF or PI3K pathways in the melanoma cells studied. To this end, SK-Mel-94 (BRAFV600E-positive) cells were transfected with control or previously validated small interfering RNA (siRNA) against mutant (BRAFV600E) allele ( Sharma et al. , 2005 ), followed by infection with control- or MYC-specific (M1) shRNAs. In agreement with previously published data ( Sharma et al. , 2005 ), treatment of SK-Mel-94 cells with BRAFV600E siRNA resulted in inhibition of MEK activity, manifested in a 2.5-fold decrease in the amounts of phosphorylated ERK ( Supplementary Figure S3b ). Subsequently, depletion of C-MYC in BRAFV600E-siRNA-transfected cells resulted in a roughly 50% decrease in the number of senescent cells, when compared with MYC-depleted cells transfected with control siRNA ( Supplementary Figure S3b ). To genetically inhibit PI3K activity in SK-Mel-103 (NRASQ61R-positive) cells, cDNA for a well-known inhibitor of PI3K, PTEN, was overexpressed in these cells ( Haluska et al. , 2007 ). Overexpression of PTEN resulted in 71% reduction of PI3K activity, as was evidenced by the corresponding decrease in the amounts of phosphorylated Akt-1 in cells studied ( Supplementary Figure S3c ). Accordingly, depletion of C-MYC in PTEN-overexpressing melanoma cells yielded approximately two times fewer senescent cells compared with the population of MYC-depleted cells expressing empty vector ( Supplementary Figure S3c ). Taken together, our data suggest that genetic inhibition of BRAFV600E or PI3K pathways (although less efficient than pharmacological inhibition) is sufficient to suppress senescence of melanoma cells caused by the depletion of C-MYC. Therefore, similar to that in normal melanocytes, senescence markers in C-MYC-depleted melanoma cells require constitutively active MEK or PI3K. Senescence phenotypes induced by C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells or by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and NRAS<sup>Q61R</sup> overexpression in melanocytes occur independent of p53 or p16<sup>INK4A</sup> Oncogene-induced senescence phenotypes in mouse cells have been previously shown to depend on p53 and/or p16 ( Ventura et al. , 2007 ; Wu et al. , 2007 ; Xue et al. , 2007 ). However, the precise role of these proteins in OIS of human cells has not been well defined and is likely to be cell type-specific (see Discussion). Therefore, we attempted to identify the roles of p53 and p16INK4A in senescence phenotypes caused by C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells and by the overexpression of BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R in normal melanocytes. Levels of p53 and p16INK4A in the melanoma cells studied and in normal melanocytes are shown in Figure 4a . As it is well documented in melanomas, all the cell lines studied here, with the exception of SK-Mel-28, contain wild-type p53 ( Goding, 2000 ; Soengas et al. , 2001 ). However, regulation of p53 as well as its downstream pathways might have been altered in the course of tumor progression. To test this possibility, cells from melanoma lines SK-Mel-19, -29, -103 and -147 were infected with control or p53-specific shRNA, as described previously ( Wang et al. , 2008 ). Control cells were treated for 16 h with vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide) or 0.3 ?g/ml of doxorubicin, a DNA-damaging agent that indirectly induces stabilization of wild-type p53 and activation of its downstream targets ( Lowe et al. , 1993 ). After completion of incubation, control cells and untreated p53-shRNA-expressing cells were collected and the expression levels of p53 and its two well-characterized transcriptional targets, p21CIP/WAF ( El-Deiry et al. , 1993 ) and p53R2 (a p53-dependent ribonucleoside reductase, subunit 2) ( Tanaka et al. , 2004 ), were analysed by western blotting. As shown in Figure 4b , changes in p53, p21CIP/WAF and p53R2 levels correlate well with each other, suggesting that the p53 pathway is at least partially intact in the melanoma cells studied. As is also characteristic of many melanomas ( Sharpless and Chin, 2003 ), p16INK4A expression is absent in several of the cell lines used by us ( Figure 4a ). To determine the functional role of p16INK4A or p53 in the mediation of senescence induced by C-MYC depletion, the expression of p53 or p16INK4A was inhibited by the corresponding shRNAs in the melanoma cells SK-Mel-19, -29, -103, -147 or SK-Mel-28, -103, -147, respectively ( Supplementary Figure S4 ), followed by super-infection with control or C-MYC-shRNA-containing lentiviruses. The induction of senescence was monitored by counting SA-?-Gal-positive cells at day 5 post-infection. As shown in Figure 4c , no substantial differences in the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells were detected among cells expressing or not p53 or p16 proteins. Next, we examined the role of p53 and p16INK4A in BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-induced senescence of normal melanocytes. The levels of p53 or p16 were depleted in normal melanocytes via expression of the above shRNAs followed by super-infection with a control lentivirus vector or vectors expressing BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R cDNAs ( Figure 4d ). The proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells was determined at days 6 or 10 in NRASQ61R- or BRAFV600E-expressing melanocytes, respectively. As shown in Figure 4d , suppression of neither p53 nor p16INK4A was sufficient to rescue (even partially) senescence induced by BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R. Therefore, our data suggest that senescence induced in normal melanocytes by BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R, as well as senescence caused in melanoma cells by depletion of C-MYC, is p53- or p16INK4A-independent. C-MYC overexpression partially reverts OIS phenotypes in normal melanocytes We were interested in whether senescence caused by the overexpression of BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R in normal melanocytes associates with the inhibition of endogenous C-MYC expression. To answer this question, we assessed by western blotting endogenous C-MYC levels in normal melanocytes at different time points after infection with control vector or vectors expressing BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R cDNAs. In parallel, senescence in the above cells was monitored by determining the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells ( Figures 5a and b ). Ectopic expression of NRASQ61R caused an approximately threefold depletion of C-MYC levels by day 10 ( Figure 5a ), which was associated with the increase in the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells ( Figure 5b ). In contrast to NRASQ61R, BRAFV600E-infected melanocytes were previously shown to moderately increase proliferation rates within several days after infection ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ). In keeping with these findings, C-MYC protein levels in BRAFV600E-expressing melanocytes were increased slightly at day 6 post-infection ( Figure 5a ). However, starting after day 6, C-MYC levels in these cells were decreasing when compared with control melanocytes ( Figure 5a ). During this time, the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells gradually increased, reaching maximum at day 18 ( Figure 5b ). Therefore, C-MYC levels inversely correlate with the number of senescent cells in melanocytes expressing BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R. To determine the functional role of C-MYC overexpression in suppressing OIS in normal melanocytes, we co-expressed in these cells C-MYC cDNA in combination with cDNAs for either BRAF V600E or NRAS Q61R (see Figure 5c for schematic representation of infection and Supplementary Figure S5 ). As shown in Figure 5d , populations of melanocytes co-expressing BRAFV600E and C-MYC contained fewer SA-?-Gal-positive cells compared with populations expressing BRAFV600E and empty vector (20±3% versus 57±9% at day 14 and 29.5%±10.5% versus 71%±11% at day 18). Similarly, melanocytic populations co-expressing C-MYC and NRASQ61R contained fewer SA-?-Gal-positive cells than their counterparts expressing NRASQ61R and empty vector (46%±4% versus 59%±6% at day 6 and 51%±4.5% versus 64.5%±6.5% at day 10; Figure 5d ). We, therefore, concluded that C-MYC overexpression partially suppresses senescence induced in normal melanocytes by BRAFV600E and, to the lesser extent, by NRASQ61R.  Results C-MYC is overexpressed in melanoma metastases and in tumor-derived melanoma cells lines As an initial step in the characterization of C-MYC expression in melanocytic cells, we compared C-MYC levels in benign nevi, metastatic melanoma tissues, metastatic melanoma cell lines and cultured neonatal melanocytes. To this end, lysates from 2 benign congenital nevi and 10 melanoma metastases were subjected to immunoprecipitation with mouse C-MYC-specific antibodies, followed by western blotting with rabbit C-MYC-specific antibodies (to avoid crossreactivity) ( Figure 1a ). In parallel, C-MYC levels were determined by western blotting in total cellular extracts from 2 independently isolated populations of neonatal human melanocytes and from 10 metastasis-derived human melanoma cell lines ( Figure 1b ). As shown in Figure 1 , C-MYC protein levels were approximately three- to sevenfold higher in metastatic melanomas as compared with benign nevi. A similar increase in C-MYC levels (3- to 20-fold) was detected in samples from melanoma cell lines, when compared with normal melanocytes. These data demonstrate that C-MYC overexpression observed in cultured melanoma cells reflects upregulation of C-MYC in the course of melanoma progression and suggest that metastatic melanoma cell lines could be an adequate model for studying the functional role of C-MYC in advanced melanomas. C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells results in the induction of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>- or NRAS<sup>Q61R</sup>-dependent senescence phenotypes Recently, we demonstrated that acute and efficient short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated inhibition of C-MYC in cells from a large number of human tumor lines resulted in proliferation arrest and/or apoptosis ( Wang et al. , 2008 ). Here, we confirmed these observations for 10 melanoma cell lines using 2 C-MYC-specific shRNAs: C-MYC-shRNA-1 (M1) and C-MYC-shRNA-2 (M2). As was described previously ( Wang et al. , 2008 ), significant inhibition of C-MYC was obtained with each shRNA, although M1 suppressed C-MYC more efficiently than M2 ( Supplementary Figure S1a ). We performed expression analysis of several bona fide targets of MYC in response to its depletion in an arbitrarily chosen melanoma cell line (SK-Mel-94). As shown in Supplementary Figure S1b , expression of genes encoding cyclin B1, ornithine decarboxylase and CDC25A (positively regulated by MYC) was decreased by 2.5- to 4-fold, expression of the gene encoding p27KIP1 (suppressed by MYC) was increased by ?2-fold, whereas expression of CDK4 (positively regulated by MYC) remained virtually constant. Therefore, C-MYC depletion was accompanied by expression changes of several MYC-target genes. Depletion of C-MYC in cells from 8 out of 10 melanoma lines caused substantial reduction in proliferation rates, which eventually culminated in a complete growth arrest between days 4 and 6 ( Wang et al. , 2008 and Supplementary Figure S1c ), whereas C-MYC-depleted cells from lines UACC62 and UACC258 underwent apoptotic death shortly after infection ( Wang et al. , 2008 ; data not shown). We were interested in whether growth arrested C-MYC-depleted cells exhibit features of cellular senescence. To this end, melanoma cells infected with control or C-MYC-shRNAs were tested for the presence of well-established senescence markers: increased SA-?-Gal activity ( Itahana et al. , 2007 ) and formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci, which could be visualized by staining with DAPI and antibodies to trimethylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K93Me) ( Narita et al. , 2003 ). As shown in Figure 2b , depletion of C-MYC resulted in an approximately 7- to 10-fold increase in the percentage of SA-?-Gal-positive cells in the melanoma lines studied. Moreover, in two arbitrarily chosen BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-expressing melanoma lines, C-MYC inhibition induced an approximately three- to fivefold increase in the proportion of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci-containing cells ( Supplementary Figure S2 ). As was previously shown, transduction of activated HRAS or NRAS in normal melanocytes induces senescence that is mechanistically distinct from the one caused by BRAFV600E ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ). In particular, H-RASV12G- or NRASQ61R-expressing melanocytes became SA-?-Gal-positive, and flat and extensively vacuolized within 4–6 days after transduction, whereas, melanocytes overexpressing BRAFV600E became SA-?-Gal-positive and developed a more rounded shape without extensive vacuolization only starting 12–15 days after infection ( Figure 2a ). On the basis of these morphological differences, we noticed that C-MYC-depleted cells from melanoma lines could be segregated into two groups. Cells from the lines of the first group (SK-Mel-19, SK-Mel28, SK-Mel-29, SK-Mel-94, G-361), which express BRAFV600E ( Verhaegen et al. , 2006 ), recapitulated the senescence patterns of normal melanocytes overexpressing BRAFV600E ( Figure 2a ). In contrast, cells from the second group (SK-Mel-103, SK-Mel-147, SK-Mel-2) with NRASQ61R mutation ( Verhaegen et al. , 2006 ) resembled normal melanocytes undergoing senescence in response to the overexpression of NRASQ61R ( Figure 2a ). Therefore, our data suggest that C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells induces a cellular senescence program that is dictated by the activated oncoprotein (BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R) expressed in these cells. To determine whether senescence caused by C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells depends on constitutively active BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R, we studied the consequences of inhibiting BRAFV600E- and NRASQ61R-signaling pathways in the above cells. To this end, control and C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-94 (expressing BRAFV600E) and SK-Mel-103 (expressing NRASQ61R) cells were incubated with U0216, an inhibitor of the RAF downstream effector MEK ( Gollob et al. , 2006 ), or with LY294002 (an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), a downstream target of RAS ( Meier et al. , 2005 )). Inhibitors were added for 48 h starting at day 4 post-infection with C-MYC- or control shRNAs, that is, prior to the emergence of senescence phenotypes in C-MYC-depleted cells. Minimal effective concentrations of the inhibitors in studied melanoma cells have been established previously ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ; Verhaegen et al. , 2006 ) and were confirmed here by monitoring the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 or AKT-1 phosphorylation ( Supplementary Figure S3a ). A 48 h treatment with U0216, but not with LY294002, led to an approximately threefold decrease in the number of SA-?-Gal-positive cells in the population of C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-94 cells. Proliferation rates of control SK-Mel-94 cells were decreased by approximately 50% ( Figure 3b ), whereas proliferation of the C-MYC-depleted counterparts was unaffected, most likely because it had already been severely compromised by the absence of C-MYC. Similar results were obtained with another BRAFV600E-containing melanoma line, SK-Mel-19 (data not shown). On the other hand, treatment of C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-103 cells with U0216, while inhibiting ERK phosphorylation ( Supplementary Figure S3a ), did not affect the number of SA-?-Gal-positive and vacuolized cells ( Figure 3a ). In contrast, these phenotypes were affected by treating the cells with LY294002, as the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive and vacuolized cells decreased more than fourfold. Despite an obvious reversal of some senescence phenotypes by LY294002, the proliferation rates of C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-103 cells were not restored ( Figure 3b ), again probably owing to the absence of C-MYC expression. Similar results were obtained with another NRASQ61R-containing melanoma cell line, SK-Mel-147 (data not shown). To further confirm the involvement of activated PI3K pathway in senescence of melanoma cells, we inhibited one of the PI3K downstream effectors, mTOR-raptor ( Yang and Guan, 2007 ), in SK-Mel-103 control and MYC-depleted cells by treating them with 25 nM rapamycin ( Yang and Guan, 2007 ) for 48 h starting at day 4 post-infection. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3d , treatment with rapamycin resulted in a roughly threefold decrease in the numbers of SA-?-Gal-positive and vacuolized cells. To confirm the above data obtained via pharmacological inhibition of MEK and PI3K, we set up experiments to genetically inhibit activated BRAF or PI3K pathways in the melanoma cells studied. To this end, SK-Mel-94 (BRAFV600E-positive) cells were transfected with control or previously validated small interfering RNA (siRNA) against mutant (BRAFV600E) allele ( Sharma et al. , 2005 ), followed by infection with control- or MYC-specific (M1) shRNAs. In agreement with previously published data ( Sharma et al. , 2005 ), treatment of SK-Mel-94 cells with BRAFV600E siRNA resulted in inhibition of MEK activity, manifested in a 2.5-fold decrease in the amounts of phosphorylated ERK ( Supplementary Figure S3b ). Subsequently, depletion of C-MYC in BRAFV600E-siRNA-transfected cells resulted in a roughly 50% decrease in the number of senescent cells, when compared with MYC-depleted cells transfected with control siRNA ( Supplementary Figure S3b ). To genetically inhibit PI3K activity in SK-Mel-103 (NRASQ61R-positive) cells, cDNA for a well-known inhibitor of PI3K, PTEN, was overexpressed in these cells ( Haluska et al. , 2007 ). Overexpression of PTEN resulted in 71% reduction of PI3K activity, as was evidenced by the corresponding decrease in the amounts of phosphorylated Akt-1 in cells studied ( Supplementary Figure S3c ). Accordingly, depletion of C-MYC in PTEN-overexpressing melanoma cells yielded approximately two times fewer senescent cells compared with the population of MYC-depleted cells expressing empty vector ( Supplementary Figure S3c ). Taken together, our data suggest that genetic inhibition of BRAFV600E or PI3K pathways (although less efficient than pharmacological inhibition) is sufficient to suppress senescence of melanoma cells caused by the depletion of C-MYC. Therefore, similar to that in normal melanocytes, senescence markers in C-MYC-depleted melanoma cells require constitutively active MEK or PI3K. Senescence phenotypes induced by C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells or by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and NRAS<sup>Q61R</sup> overexpression in melanocytes occur independent of p53 or p16<sup>INK4A</sup> Oncogene-induced senescence phenotypes in mouse cells have been previously shown to depend on p53 and/or p16 ( Ventura et al. , 2007 ; Wu et al. , 2007 ; Xue et al. , 2007 ). However, the precise role of these proteins in OIS of human cells has not been well defined and is likely to be cell type-specific (see Discussion). Therefore, we attempted to identify the roles of p53 and p16INK4A in senescence phenotypes caused by C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells and by the overexpression of BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R in normal melanocytes. Levels of p53 and p16INK4A in the melanoma cells studied and in normal melanocytes are shown in Figure 4a . As it is well documented in melanomas, all the cell lines studied here, with the exception of SK-Mel-28, contain wild-type p53 ( Goding, 2000 ; Soengas et al. , 2001 ). However, regulation of p53 as well as its downstream pathways might have been altered in the course of tumor progression. To test this possibility, cells from melanoma lines SK-Mel-19, -29, -103 and -147 were infected with control or p53-specific shRNA, as described previously ( Wang et al. , 2008 ). Control cells were treated for 16 h with vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide) or 0.3 ?g/ml of doxorubicin, a DNA-damaging agent that indirectly induces stabilization of wild-type p53 and activation of its downstream targets ( Lowe et al. , 1993 ). After completion of incubation, control cells and untreated p53-shRNA-expressing cells were collected and the expression levels of p53 and its two well-characterized transcriptional targets, p21CIP/WAF ( El-Deiry et al. , 1993 ) and p53R2 (a p53-dependent ribonucleoside reductase, subunit 2) ( Tanaka et al. , 2004 ), were analysed by western blotting. As shown in Figure 4b , changes in p53, p21CIP/WAF and p53R2 levels correlate well with each other, suggesting that the p53 pathway is at least partially intact in the melanoma cells studied. As is also characteristic of many melanomas ( Sharpless and Chin, 2003 ), p16INK4A expression is absent in several of the cell lines used by us ( Figure 4a ). To determine the functional role of p16INK4A or p53 in the mediation of senescence induced by C-MYC depletion, the expression of p53 or p16INK4A was inhibited by the corresponding shRNAs in the melanoma cells SK-Mel-19, -29, -103, -147 or SK-Mel-28, -103, -147, respectively ( Supplementary Figure S4 ), followed by super-infection with control or C-MYC-shRNA-containing lentiviruses. The induction of senescence was monitored by counting SA-?-Gal-positive cells at day 5 post-infection. As shown in Figure 4c , no substantial differences in the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells were detected among cells expressing or not p53 or p16 proteins. Next, we examined the role of p53 and p16INK4A in BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-induced senescence of normal melanocytes. The levels of p53 or p16 were depleted in normal melanocytes via expression of the above shRNAs followed by super-infection with a control lentivirus vector or vectors expressing BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R cDNAs ( Figure 4d ). The proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells was determined at days 6 or 10 in NRASQ61R- or BRAFV600E-expressing melanocytes, respectively. As shown in Figure 4d , suppression of neither p53 nor p16INK4A was sufficient to rescue (even partially) senescence induced by BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R. Therefore, our data suggest that senescence induced in normal melanocytes by BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R, as well as senescence caused in melanoma cells by depletion of C-MYC, is p53- or p16INK4A-independent. C-MYC overexpression partially reverts OIS phenotypes in normal melanocytes We were interested in whether senescence caused by the overexpression of BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R in normal melanocytes associates with the inhibition of endogenous C-MYC expression. To answer this question, we assessed by western blotting endogenous C-MYC levels in normal melanocytes at different time points after infection with control vector or vectors expressing BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R cDNAs. In parallel, senescence in the above cells was monitored by determining the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells ( Figures 5a and b ). Ectopic expression of NRASQ61R caused an approximately threefold depletion of C-MYC levels by day 10 ( Figure 5a ), which was associated with the increase in the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells ( Figure 5b ). In contrast to NRASQ61R, BRAFV600E-infected melanocytes were previously shown to moderately increase proliferation rates within several days after infection ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ). In keeping with these findings, C-MYC protein levels in BRAFV600E-expressing melanocytes were increased slightly at day 6 post-infection ( Figure 5a ). However, starting after day 6, C-MYC levels in these cells were decreasing when compared with control melanocytes ( Figure 5a ). During this time, the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells gradually increased, reaching maximum at day 18 ( Figure 5b ). Therefore, C-MYC levels inversely correlate with the number of senescent cells in melanocytes expressing BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R. To determine the functional role of C-MYC overexpression in suppressing OIS in normal melanocytes, we co-expressed in these cells C-MYC cDNA in combination with cDNAs for either BRAF V600E or NRAS Q61R (see Figure 5c for schematic representation of infection and Supplementary Figure S5 ). As shown in Figure 5d , populations of melanocytes co-expressing BRAFV600E and C-MYC contained fewer SA-?-Gal-positive cells compared with populations expressing BRAFV600E and empty vector (20±3% versus 57±9% at day 14 and 29.5%±10.5% versus 71%±11% at day 18). Similarly, melanocytic populations co-expressing C-MYC and NRASQ61R contained fewer SA-?-Gal-positive cells than their counterparts expressing NRASQ61R and empty vector (46%±4% versus 59%±6% at day 6 and 51%±4.5% versus 64.5%±6.5% at day 10; Figure 5d ). We, therefore, concluded that C-MYC overexpression partially suppresses senescence induced in normal melanocytes by BRAFV600E and, to the lesser extent, by NRASQ61R.  C-MYC is overexpressed in melanoma metastases and in tumor-derived melanoma cells lines As an initial step in the characterization of C-MYC expression in melanocytic cells, we compared C-MYC levels in benign nevi, metastatic melanoma tissues, metastatic melanoma cell lines and cultured neonatal melanocytes. To this end, lysates from 2 benign congenital nevi and 10 melanoma metastases were subjected to immunoprecipitation with mouse C-MYC-specific antibodies, followed by western blotting with rabbit C-MYC-specific antibodies (to avoid crossreactivity) ( Figure 1a ). In parallel, C-MYC levels were determined by western blotting in total cellular extracts from 2 independently isolated populations of neonatal human melanocytes and from 10 metastasis-derived human melanoma cell lines ( Figure 1b ). As shown in Figure 1 , C-MYC protein levels were approximately three- to sevenfold higher in metastatic melanomas as compared with benign nevi. A similar increase in C-MYC levels (3- to 20-fold) was detected in samples from melanoma cell lines, when compared with normal melanocytes. These data demonstrate that C-MYC overexpression observed in cultured melanoma cells reflects upregulation of C-MYC in the course of melanoma progression and suggest that metastatic melanoma cell lines could be an adequate model for studying the functional role of C-MYC in advanced melanomas.  C-MYC is overexpressed in melanoma metastases and in tumor-derived melanoma cells lines As an initial step in the characterization of C-MYC expression in melanocytic cells, we compared C-MYC levels in benign nevi, metastatic melanoma tissues, metastatic melanoma cell lines and cultured neonatal melanocytes.

A similar increase in C-MYC levels (3- to 20-fold) was detected in samples from melanoma cell lines, when compared with normal melanocytes. These data demonstrate that C-MYC overexpression observed in cultured melanoma cells reflects upregulation of C-MYC in the course of melanoma progression and suggest that metastatic melanoma cell lines could be an adequate model for studying the functional role of C-MYC in advanced melanomas.  C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells results in the induction of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>- or NRAS<sup>Q61R</sup>-dependent senescence phenotypes Recently, we demonstrated that acute and efficient short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated inhibition of C-MYC in cells from a large number of human tumor lines resulted in proliferation arrest and/or apoptosis ( Wang et al. , 2008 ). Here, we confirmed these observations for 10 melanoma cell lines using 2 C-MYC-specific shRNAs: C-MYC-shRNA-1 (M1) and C-MYC-shRNA-2 (M2). As was described previously ( Wang et al. , 2008 ), significant inhibition of C-MYC was obtained with each shRNA, although M1 suppressed C-MYC more efficiently than M2 ( Supplementary Figure S1a ). We performed expression analysis of several bona fide targets of MYC in response to its depletion in an arbitrarily chosen melanoma cell line (SK-Mel-94). As shown in Supplementary Figure S1b , expression of genes encoding cyclin B1, ornithine decarboxylase and CDC25A (positively regulated by MYC) was decreased by 2.5- to 4-fold, expression of the gene encoding p27KIP1 (suppressed by MYC) was increased by ?2-fold, whereas expression of CDK4 (positively regulated by MYC) remained virtually constant. Therefore, C-MYC depletion was accompanied by expression changes of several MYC-target genes. Depletion of C-MYC in cells from 8 out of 10 melanoma lines caused substantial reduction in proliferation rates, which eventually culminated in a complete growth arrest between days 4 and 6 ( Wang et al. , 2008 and Supplementary Figure S1c ), whereas C-MYC-depleted cells from lines UACC62 and UACC258 underwent apoptotic death shortly after infection ( Wang et al. , 2008 ; data not shown). We were interested in whether growth arrested C-MYC-depleted cells exhibit features of cellular senescence. To this end, melanoma cells infected with control or C-MYC-shRNAs were tested for the presence of well-established senescence markers: increased SA-?-Gal activity ( Itahana et al. , 2007 ) and formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci, which could be visualized by staining with DAPI and antibodies to trimethylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K93Me) ( Narita et al. , 2003 ). As shown in Figure 2b , depletion of C-MYC resulted in an approximately 7- to 10-fold increase in the percentage of SA-?-Gal-positive cells in the melanoma lines studied. Moreover, in two arbitrarily chosen BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-expressing melanoma lines, C-MYC inhibition induced an approximately three- to fivefold increase in the proportion of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci-containing cells ( Supplementary Figure S2 ). As was previously shown, transduction of activated HRAS or NRAS in normal melanocytes induces senescence that is mechanistically distinct from the one caused by BRAFV600E ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ). In particular, H-RASV12G- or NRASQ61R-expressing melanocytes became SA-?-Gal-positive, and flat and extensively vacuolized within 4–6 days after transduction, whereas, melanocytes overexpressing BRAFV600E became SA-?-Gal-positive and developed a more rounded shape without extensive vacuolization only starting 12–15 days after infection ( Figure 2a ). On the basis of these morphological differences, we noticed that C-MYC-depleted cells from melanoma lines could be segregated into two groups. Cells from the lines of the first group (SK-Mel-19, SK-Mel28, SK-Mel-29, SK-Mel-94, G-361), which express BRAFV600E ( Verhaegen et al. , 2006 ), recapitulated the senescence patterns of normal melanocytes overexpressing BRAFV600E ( Figure 2a ). In contrast, cells from the second group (SK-Mel-103, SK-Mel-147, SK-Mel-2) with NRASQ61R mutation ( Verhaegen et al. , 2006 ) resembled normal melanocytes undergoing senescence in response to the overexpression of NRASQ61R ( Figure 2a ). Therefore, our data suggest that C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells induces a cellular senescence program that is dictated by the activated oncoprotein (BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R) expressed in these cells. To determine whether senescence caused by C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells depends on constitutively active BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R, we studied the consequences of inhibiting BRAFV600E- and NRASQ61R-signaling pathways in the above cells. To this end, control and C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-94 (expressing BRAFV600E) and SK-Mel-103 (expressing NRASQ61R) cells were incubated with U0216, an inhibitor of the RAF downstream effector MEK ( Gollob et al. , 2006 ), or with LY294002 (an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), a downstream target of RAS ( Meier et al. , 2005 )). Inhibitors were added for 48 h starting at day 4 post-infection with C-MYC- or control shRNAs, that is, prior to the emergence of senescence phenotypes in C-MYC-depleted cells. Minimal effective concentrations of the inhibitors in studied melanoma cells have been established previously ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ; Verhaegen et al. , 2006 ) and were confirmed here by monitoring the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 or AKT-1 phosphorylation ( Supplementary Figure S3a ). A 48 h treatment with U0216, but not with LY294002, led to an approximately threefold decrease in the number of SA-?-Gal-positive cells in the population of C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-94 cells. Proliferation rates of control SK-Mel-94 cells were decreased by approximately 50% ( Figure 3b ), whereas proliferation of the C-MYC-depleted counterparts was unaffected, most likely because it had already been severely compromised by the absence of C-MYC. Similar results were obtained with another BRAFV600E-containing melanoma line, SK-Mel-19 (data not shown). On the other hand, treatment of C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-103 cells with U0216, while inhibiting ERK phosphorylation ( Supplementary Figure S3a ), did not affect the number of SA-?-Gal-positive and vacuolized cells ( Figure 3a ). In contrast, these phenotypes were affected by treating the cells with LY294002, as the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive and vacuolized cells decreased more than fourfold. Despite an obvious reversal of some senescence phenotypes by LY294002, the proliferation rates of C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-103 cells were not restored ( Figure 3b ), again probably owing to the absence of C-MYC expression. Similar results were obtained with another NRASQ61R-containing melanoma cell line, SK-Mel-147 (data not shown). To further confirm the involvement of activated PI3K pathway in senescence of melanoma cells, we inhibited one of the PI3K downstream effectors, mTOR-raptor ( Yang and Guan, 2007 ), in SK-Mel-103 control and MYC-depleted cells by treating them with 25 nM rapamycin ( Yang and Guan, 2007 ) for 48 h starting at day 4 post-infection. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3d , treatment with rapamycin resulted in a roughly threefold decrease in the numbers of SA-?-Gal-positive and vacuolized cells. To confirm the above data obtained via pharmacological inhibition of MEK and PI3K, we set up experiments to genetically inhibit activated BRAF or PI3K pathways in the melanoma cells studied. To this end, SK-Mel-94 (BRAFV600E-positive) cells were transfected with control or previously validated small interfering RNA (siRNA) against mutant (BRAFV600E) allele ( Sharma et al. , 2005 ), followed by infection with control- or MYC-specific (M1) shRNAs. In agreement with previously published data ( Sharma et al. , 2005 ), treatment of SK-Mel-94 cells with BRAFV600E siRNA resulted in inhibition of MEK activity, manifested in a 2.5-fold decrease in the amounts of phosphorylated ERK ( Supplementary Figure S3b ). Subsequently, depletion of C-MYC in BRAFV600E-siRNA-transfected cells resulted in a roughly 50% decrease in the number of senescent cells, when compared with MYC-depleted cells transfected with control siRNA ( Supplementary Figure S3b ). To genetically inhibit PI3K activity in SK-Mel-103 (NRASQ61R-positive) cells, cDNA for a well-known inhibitor of PI3K, PTEN, was overexpressed in these cells ( Haluska et al. , 2007 ). Overexpression of PTEN resulted in 71% reduction of PI3K activity, as was evidenced by the corresponding decrease in the amounts of phosphorylated Akt-1 in cells studied ( Supplementary Figure S3c ). Accordingly, depletion of C-MYC in PTEN-overexpressing melanoma cells yielded approximately two times fewer senescent cells compared with the population of MYC-depleted cells expressing empty vector ( Supplementary Figure S3c ). Taken together, our data suggest that genetic inhibition of BRAFV600E or PI3K pathways (although less efficient than pharmacological inhibition) is sufficient to suppress senescence of melanoma cells caused by the depletion of C-MYC. Therefore, similar to that in normal melanocytes, senescence markers in C-MYC-depleted melanoma cells require constitutively active MEK or PI3K.  C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells results in the induction of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>- or NRAS<sup>Q61R</sup>-dependent senescence phenotypes Recently, we demonstrated that acute and efficient short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated inhibition of C-MYC in cells from a large number of human tumor lines resulted in proliferation arrest and/or apoptosis ( Wang et al. , 2008 ). Here, we confirmed these observations for 10 melanoma cell lines using 2 C-MYC-specific shRNAs: C-MYC-shRNA-1 (M1) and C-MYC-shRNA-2 (M2). As was described previously ( Wang et al. , 2008 ), significant inhibition of C-MYC was obtained with each shRNA, although M1 suppressed C-MYC more efficiently than M2 ( Supplementary Figure S1a ). We performed expression analysis of several bona fide targets of MYC in response to its depletion in an arbitrarily chosen melanoma cell line (SK-Mel-94). As shown in Supplementary Figure S1b , expression of genes encoding cyclin B1, ornithine decarboxylase and CDC25A (positively regulated by MYC) was decreased by 2.5- to 4-fold, expression of the gene encoding p27KIP1 (suppressed by MYC) was increased by ?2-fold, whereas expression of CDK4 (positively regulated by MYC) remained virtually constant. Therefore, C-MYC depletion was accompanied by expression changes of several MYC-target genes. Depletion of C-MYC in cells from 8 out of 10 melanoma lines caused substantial reduction in proliferation rates, which eventually culminated in a complete growth arrest between days 4 and 6 ( Wang et al. , 2008 and Supplementary Figure S1c ), whereas C-MYC-depleted cells from lines UACC62 and UACC258 underwent apoptotic death shortly after infection ( Wang et al. , 2008 ; data not shown). We were interested in whether growth arrested C-MYC-depleted cells exhibit features of cellular senescence. To this end, melanoma cells infected with control or C-MYC-shRNAs were tested for the presence of well-established senescence markers: increased SA-?-Gal activity ( Itahana et al. , 2007 ) and formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci, which could be visualized by staining with DAPI and antibodies to trimethylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K93Me) ( Narita et al. , 2003 ). As shown in Figure 2b , depletion of C-MYC resulted in an approximately 7- to 10-fold increase in the percentage of SA-?-Gal-positive cells in the melanoma lines studied. Moreover, in two arbitrarily chosen BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-expressing melanoma lines, C-MYC inhibition induced an approximately three- to fivefold increase in the proportion of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci-containing cells ( Supplementary Figure S2 ). As was previously shown, transduction of activated HRAS or NRAS in normal melanocytes induces senescence that is mechanistically distinct from the one caused by BRAFV600E ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ). In particular, H-RASV12G- or NRASQ61R-expressing melanocytes became SA-?-Gal-positive, and flat and extensively vacuolized within 4–6 days after transduction, whereas, melanocytes overexpressing BRAFV600E became SA-?-Gal-positive and developed a more rounded shape without extensive vacuolization only starting 12–15 days after infection ( Figure 2a ). On the basis of these morphological differences, we noticed that C-MYC-depleted cells from melanoma lines could be segregated into two groups. Cells from the lines of the first group (SK-Mel-19, SK-Mel28, SK-Mel-29, SK-Mel-94, G-361), which express BRAFV600E ( Verhaegen et al. , 2006 ), recapitulated the senescence patterns of normal melanocytes overexpressing BRAFV600E ( Figure 2a ). In contrast, cells from the second group (SK-Mel-103, SK-Mel-147, SK-Mel-2) with NRASQ61R mutation ( Verhaegen et al. , 2006 ) resembled normal melanocytes undergoing senescence in response to the overexpression of NRASQ61R ( Figure 2a ). Therefore, our data suggest that C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells induces a cellular senescence program that is dictated by the activated oncoprotein (BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R) expressed in these cells. To determine whether senescence caused by C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells depends on constitutively active BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R, we studied the consequences of inhibiting BRAFV600E- and NRASQ61R-signaling pathways in the above cells. To this end, control and C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-94 (expressing BRAFV600E) and SK-Mel-103 (expressing NRASQ61R) cells were incubated with U0216, an inhibitor of the RAF downstream effector MEK ( Gollob et al. , 2006 ), or with LY294002 (an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), a downstream target of RAS ( Meier et al. , 2005 )). Inhibitors were added for 48 h starting at day 4 post-infection with C-MYC- or control shRNAs, that is, prior to the emergence of senescence phenotypes in C-MYC-depleted cells. Minimal effective concentrations of the inhibitors in studied melanoma cells have been established previously ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ; Verhaegen et al. , 2006 ) and were confirmed here by monitoring the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 or AKT-1 phosphorylation ( Supplementary Figure S3a ). A 48 h treatment with U0216, but not with LY294002, led to an approximately threefold decrease in the number of SA-?-Gal-positive cells in the population of C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-94 cells. Proliferation rates of control SK-Mel-94 cells were decreased by approximately 50% ( Figure 3b ), whereas proliferation of the C-MYC-depleted counterparts was unaffected, most likely because it had already been severely compromised by the absence of C-MYC. Similar results were obtained with another BRAFV600E-containing melanoma line, SK-Mel-19 (data not shown). On the other hand, treatment of C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-103 cells with U0216, while inhibiting ERK phosphorylation ( Supplementary Figure S3a ), did not affect the number of SA-?-Gal-positive and vacuolized cells ( Figure 3a ). In contrast, these phenotypes were affected by treating the cells with LY294002, as the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive and vacuolized cells decreased more than fourfold. Despite an obvious reversal of some senescence phenotypes by LY294002, the proliferation rates of C-MYC-depleted SK-Mel-103 cells were not restored ( Figure 3b ), again probably owing to the absence of C-MYC expression. Similar results were obtained with another NRASQ61R-containing melanoma cell line, SK-Mel-147 (data not shown). To further confirm the involvement of activated PI3K pathway in senescence of melanoma cells, we inhibited one of the PI3K downstream effectors, mTOR-raptor ( Yang and Guan, 2007 ), in SK-Mel-103 control and MYC-depleted cells by treating them with 25 nM rapamycin ( Yang and Guan, 2007 ) for 48 h starting at day 4 post-infection. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3d , treatment with rapamycin resulted in a roughly threefold decrease in the numbers of SA-?-Gal-positive and vacuolized cells. To confirm the above data obtained via pharmacological inhibition of MEK and PI3K, we set up experiments to genetically inhibit activated BRAF or PI3K pathways in the melanoma cells studied. To this end, SK-Mel-94 (BRAFV600E-positive) cells were transfected with control or previously validated small interfering RNA (siRNA) against mutant (BRAFV600E) allele ( Sharma et al. , 2005 ), followed by infection with control- or MYC-specific (M1) shRNAs. In agreement with previously published data ( Sharma et al. , 2005 ), treatment of SK-Mel-94 cells with BRAFV600E siRNA resulted in inhibition of MEK activity, manifested in a 2.5-fold decrease in the amounts of phosphorylated ERK ( Supplementary Figure S3b ). Subsequently, depletion of C-MYC in BRAFV600E-siRNA-transfected cells resulted in a roughly 50% decrease in the number of senescent cells, when compared with MYC-depleted cells transfected with control siRNA ( Supplementary Figure S3b ). To genetically inhibit PI3K activity in SK-Mel-103 (NRASQ61R-positive) cells, cDNA for a well-known inhibitor of PI3K, PTEN, was overexpressed in these cells ( Haluska et al. , 2007 ). Overexpression of PTEN resulted in 71% reduction of PI3K activity, as was evidenced by the corresponding decrease in the amounts of phosphorylated Akt-1 in cells studied ( Supplementary Figure S3c ). Accordingly, depletion of C-MYC in PTEN-overexpressing melanoma cells yielded approximately two times fewer senescent cells compared with the population of MYC-depleted cells expressing empty vector ( Supplementary Figure S3c ). Taken together, our data suggest that genetic inhibition of BRAFV600E or PI3K pathways (although less efficient than pharmacological inhibition) is sufficient to suppress senescence of melanoma cells caused by the depletion of C-MYC. Therefore, similar to that in normal melanocytes, senescence markers in C-MYC-depleted melanoma cells require constitutively active MEK or PI3K.  Senescence phenotypes induced by C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells or by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and NRAS<sup>Q61R</sup> overexpression in melanocytes occur independent of p53 or p16<sup>INK4A</sup> Oncogene-induced senescence phenotypes in mouse cells have been previously shown to depend on p53 and/or p16 ( Ventura et al. , 2007 ; Wu et al. , 2007 ; Xue et al. , 2007 ). However, the precise role of these proteins in OIS of human cells has not been well defined and is likely to be cell type-specific (see Discussion). Therefore, we attempted to identify the roles of p53 and p16INK4A in senescence phenotypes caused by C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells and by the overexpression of BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R in normal melanocytes. Levels of p53 and p16INK4A in the melanoma cells studied and in normal melanocytes are shown in Figure 4a . As it is well documented in melanomas, all the cell lines studied here, with the exception of SK-Mel-28, contain wild-type p53 ( Goding, 2000 ; Soengas et al. , 2001 ). However, regulation of p53 as well as its downstream pathways might have been altered in the course of tumor progression. To test this possibility, cells from melanoma lines SK-Mel-19, -29, -103 and -147 were infected with control or p53-specific shRNA, as described previously ( Wang et al. , 2008 ). Control cells were treated for 16 h with vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide) or 0.3 ?g/ml of doxorubicin, a DNA-damaging agent that indirectly induces stabilization of wild-type p53 and activation of its downstream targets ( Lowe et al. , 1993 ). After completion of incubation, control cells and untreated p53-shRNA-expressing cells were collected and the expression levels of p53 and its two well-characterized transcriptional targets, p21CIP/WAF ( El-Deiry et al. , 1993 ) and p53R2 (a p53-dependent ribonucleoside reductase, subunit 2) ( Tanaka et al. , 2004 ), were analysed by western blotting. As shown in Figure 4b , changes in p53, p21CIP/WAF and p53R2 levels correlate well with each other, suggesting that the p53 pathway is at least partially intact in the melanoma cells studied. As is also characteristic of many melanomas ( Sharpless and Chin, 2003 ), p16INK4A expression is absent in several of the cell lines used by us ( Figure 4a ). To determine the functional role of p16INK4A or p53 in the mediation of senescence induced by C-MYC depletion, the expression of p53 or p16INK4A was inhibited by the corresponding shRNAs in the melanoma cells SK-Mel-19, -29, -103, -147 or SK-Mel-28, -103, -147, respectively ( Supplementary Figure S4 ), followed by super-infection with control or C-MYC-shRNA-containing lentiviruses. The induction of senescence was monitored by counting SA-?-Gal-positive cells at day 5 post-infection. As shown in Figure 4c , no substantial differences in the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells were detected among cells expressing or not p53 or p16 proteins. Next, we examined the role of p53 and p16INK4A in BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-induced senescence of normal melanocytes. The levels of p53 or p16 were depleted in normal melanocytes via expression of the above shRNAs followed by super-infection with a control lentivirus vector or vectors expressing BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R cDNAs ( Figure 4d ). The proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells was determined at days 6 or 10 in NRASQ61R- or BRAFV600E-expressing melanocytes, respectively. As shown in Figure 4d , suppression of neither p53 nor p16INK4A was sufficient to rescue (even partially) senescence induced by BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R. Therefore, our data suggest that senescence induced in normal melanocytes by BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R, as well as senescence caused in melanoma cells by depletion of C-MYC, is p53- or p16INK4A-independent.  Senescence phenotypes induced by C-MYC depletion in melanoma cells or by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and NRAS<sup>Q61R</sup> overexpression in melanocytes occur independent of p53 or p16<sup>INK4A</sup> Oncogene-induced senescence phenotypes in mouse cells have been previously shown to depend on p53 and/or p16 ( Ventura et al. , 2007 ; Wu et al. , 2007 ; Xue et al. , 2007 ).

The induction of senescence was monitored by counting SA-?-Gal-positive cells at day 5 post-infection.

Next, we examined the role of p53 and p16INK4A in BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-induced senescence of normal melanocytes. The levels of p53 or p16 were depleted in normal melanocytes via expression of the above shRNAs followed by super-infection with a control lentivirus vector or vectors expressing BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R cDNAs ( Figure 4d ). The proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells was determined at days 6 or 10 in NRASQ61R- or BRAFV600E-expressing melanocytes, respectively. As shown in Figure 4d , suppression of neither p53 nor p16INK4A was sufficient to rescue (even partially) senescence induced by BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R. Therefore, our data suggest that senescence induced in normal melanocytes by BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R, as well as senescence caused in melanoma cells by depletion of C-MYC, is p53- or p16INK4A-independent.  C-MYC overexpression partially reverts OIS phenotypes in normal melanocytes We were interested in whether senescence caused by the overexpression of BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R in normal melanocytes associates with the inhibition of endogenous C-MYC expression. To answer this question, we assessed by western blotting endogenous C-MYC levels in normal melanocytes at different time points after infection with control vector or vectors expressing BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R cDNAs. In parallel, senescence in the above cells was monitored by determining the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells ( Figures 5a and b ). Ectopic expression of NRASQ61R caused an approximately threefold depletion of C-MYC levels by day 10 ( Figure 5a ), which was associated with the increase in the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells ( Figure 5b ). In contrast to NRASQ61R, BRAFV600E-infected melanocytes were previously shown to moderately increase proliferation rates within several days after infection ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ). In keeping with these findings, C-MYC protein levels in BRAFV600E-expressing melanocytes were increased slightly at day 6 post-infection ( Figure 5a ). However, starting after day 6, C-MYC levels in these cells were decreasing when compared with control melanocytes ( Figure 5a ). During this time, the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells gradually increased, reaching maximum at day 18 ( Figure 5b ). Therefore, C-MYC levels inversely correlate with the number of senescent cells in melanocytes expressing BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R. To determine the functional role of C-MYC overexpression in suppressing OIS in normal melanocytes, we co-expressed in these cells C-MYC cDNA in combination with cDNAs for either BRAF V600E or NRAS Q61R (see Figure 5c for schematic representation of infection and Supplementary Figure S5 ). As shown in Figure 5d , populations of melanocytes co-expressing BRAFV600E and C-MYC contained fewer SA-?-Gal-positive cells compared with populations expressing BRAFV600E and empty vector (20±3% versus 57±9% at day 14 and 29.5%±10.5% versus 71%±11% at day 18). Similarly, melanocytic populations co-expressing C-MYC and NRASQ61R contained fewer SA-?-Gal-positive cells than their counterparts expressing NRASQ61R and empty vector (46%±4% versus 59%±6% at day 6 and 51%±4.5% versus 64.5%±6.5% at day 10; Figure 5d ). We, therefore, concluded that C-MYC overexpression partially suppresses senescence induced in normal melanocytes by BRAFV600E and, to the lesser extent, by NRASQ61R.  C-MYC overexpression partially reverts OIS phenotypes in normal melanocytes We were interested in whether senescence caused by the overexpression of BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R in normal melanocytes associates with the inhibition of endogenous C-MYC expression. To answer this question, we assessed by western blotting endogenous C-MYC levels in normal melanocytes at different time points after infection with control vector or vectors expressing BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R cDNAs. In parallel, senescence in the above cells was monitored by determining the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells ( Figures 5a and b ). Ectopic expression of NRASQ61R caused an approximately threefold depletion of C-MYC levels by day 10 ( Figure 5a ), which was associated with the increase in the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells ( Figure 5b ). In contrast to NRASQ61R, BRAFV600E-infected melanocytes were previously shown to moderately increase proliferation rates within several days after infection ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ). In keeping with these findings, C-MYC protein levels in BRAFV600E-expressing melanocytes were increased slightly at day 6 post-infection ( Figure 5a ). However, starting after day 6, C-MYC levels in these cells were decreasing when compared with control melanocytes ( Figure 5a ). During this time, the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells gradually increased, reaching maximum at day 18 ( Figure 5b ). Therefore, C-MYC levels inversely correlate with the number of senescent cells in melanocytes expressing BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R. To determine the functional role of C-MYC overexpression in suppressing OIS in normal melanocytes, we co-expressed in these cells C-MYC cDNA in combination with cDNAs for either BRAF V600E or NRAS Q61R (see Figure 5c for schematic representation of infection and Supplementary Figure S5 ). As shown in Figure 5d , populations of melanocytes co-expressing BRAFV600E and C-MYC contained fewer SA-?-Gal-positive cells compared with populations expressing BRAFV600E and empty vector (20±3% versus 57±9% at day 14 and 29.5%±10.5% versus 71%±11% at day 18). Similarly, melanocytic populations co-expressing C-MYC and NRASQ61R contained fewer SA-?-Gal-positive cells than their counterparts expressing NRASQ61R and empty vector (46%±4% versus 59%±6% at day 6 and 51%±4.5% versus 64.5%±6.5% at day 10; Figure 5d ). We, therefore, concluded that C-MYC overexpression partially suppresses senescence induced in normal melanocytes by BRAFV600E and, to the lesser extent, by NRASQ61R.  Discussion Oncogene-induced senescence in normal cells is emerging as a fail-safe mechanism for suppressing tumor development at a pre-malignant stage ( Bringold and Serrano, 2000 ; Collado and Serrano, 2006 ; Haluska et al. , 2006 ; Ha et al. , 2007 ). In humans, OIS is probably best exemplified by nevi that represent benign tumors consisting primarily of non-proliferative melanocytes, which often harbor activating mutations in the BRAF or NRAS gene ( Michaloglou et al. , 2005 ). The malignant melanomas that frequently originate from nevi must, therefore, develop mechanisms for escaping OIS ( Michaloglou et al. , 2005 ; Mooi and Peeper, 2006 ). In answer to this problem, we report here that enforced C-MYC expression in normal melanocytes partially overcomes senescence-inducing effects of BRAFV600E and, to a lesser extent, of NRASQ61R, whereas acute depletion of C-MYC causes senescence in BRAFV600E and NRASQ61R melanoma cells. Interestingly, even partial (?70%) depletion of C-MYC appears to be sufficient to induce senescence in melanoma cells. Moreover, a simple mathematical analysis of data presented in Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure S1a reveals that senescence in melanoma cells could be induced when C-MYC levels are suppressed approximately to those in normal melanocytes (majority of the studied cell lines), and even when the remaining amounts of C-MYC in melanoma cells are still higher than C-MYC amounts in normal melanocytes (for example, SK-Mel-2 or G361 cells infected with M2-shRNA). Therefore, partial suppression of C-MYC is sufficient to induce senescence in at least several melanoma cell lines. We have demonstrated that C-MYC-depleted BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-expressing melanoma cells morphologically resemble normal melanocytes that have become senescent as a consequence of BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R overexpression, respectively. These data suggest that BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-specific senescence programs are latent in melanoma cells and subjected to reactivation under certain conditions. Moreover, it appears that one of the major roles of C-MYC overexpression in melanoma cells is to suppress senescence-inducing activity of the above-mentioned oncoproteins. These suggestions are further supported by our findings that pharmacological inhibition of downstream targets of activated BRAF or NRAS in senescent melanoma cells results in suppression of several senescence phenotypes ( Figure 3 ). Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K but not MEK was previously reported to decrease vacuolization and the proportion of SA-?-Gal-positive cells in normal melanocytes expressing HRASV12G ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ). In fact, additional similarities exist between senescence in melanoma cells caused by depletion of C-MYC and OIS in melanocytes. First, in both cases, senescence phenotypes depended on or were associated with low levels of C-MYC. Indeed, in melanoma cells, C-MYC depletion was the cause of senescence, whereas senescent melanocytes with BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R had decreased levels of C-MYC ( Figure 5 ). Second, in all cases, senescence phenotypes were p53- or p16INK4A-independent, in contrast to what is commonly seen in rodent cells. In fact, the contribution of these tumor suppressors to the premature senescence of normal human cells is still under debate. For example, normal human fibroblasts deficient in p16INK4A and ectopically expressing the catalytic subunit of the telomerase reverse transcriptase are resistant to the antiproliferative effects of activated HRAS ( Drayton et al. , 2003 ). Similarly, oncogenic HRAS may be a poor inducer of premature senescence in freshly isolated human fibroblasts expressing low levels of p16INK4A ( Benanti and Galloway, 2004 ). On the other hand, p16INK4A deficiency did not prevent senescence by BRAFV600E in normal human fibroblasts ( Michaloglou et al. , 2005 ). In addition, heterogeneous expression of p16INK4A can be detected in nevi. Thus, SA-?-Gal-positive nevus cells may not necessarily accumulate p16INK4A ( Michaloglou et al. , 2005 ). Furthermore, HRASG12V caused senescence independently of p53 in primary human esophageal keratinocytes ( Takaoka et al. , 2004 ), whereas p53 or p16INK4A were shown to be dispensable for the senescence induced in normal melanocytes by HRASV12G ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ). Therefore, p53 and p16INK4A may not be universal mediators of OIS in human cells, irrespective of whether they are normal or transformed. Our data demonstrate that ectopic overexpression of C-MYC can partially rescue the senescence phenotype of melanocytes expressing BRAFV600E, and that it does so less efficiently in melanocytes expressing NRASQ61R. Recently, it has been shown that unlike BRAFV600E, overexpression of NRASQ61R in normal melanocytes induces an unfolded protein response, and that shRNA-mediated inhibition of several proteins involved in the unfolded protein response (ATF-4 and ATF-6 ( Kim et al. , 2006 )) suppresses NRASQ61R-induced senescence ( Denoyelle et al. , 2006 ). In our experience, C-MYC overexpression in melanocytes does not affect the unfolded protein response pathway and, in particular, expression of ATF-4 and -6 (data not shown), which could account for the inability of C-MYC to successfully overcome senescence induced by NRASQ61R. Interestingly, in melanomas from non-chronically sun-damaged skin, NRAS mutations are less common than BRAF mutations ( Curtin et al. , 2005 ). One of the possible explanations for this observation could be that in the course of melanoma progression, senescence induced by activated NRAS is less likely to be overcome than that induced by activated BRAF. Our in vitro data on co-expression of C-MYC with BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R in normal melanocytes support this scenario. C-MYC has been implicated in opposing senescence that is not induced by oncogenes. Indeed, a recent study by Guney et al. (2006) demonstrated that 50% depletion of C-MYC in normal human fibroblasts ectopically expressing telomerase reverse transcriptase resulted in the premature induction of senescence after five passages. Similarly, continuous partial inhibition of C-MYC in M14 melanoma cells (over a period of seven passages) was reported to induce cell crisis associated with telomere shortening, apoptosis and increased activity of SA-?-Gal ( Biroccio et al. 2003 ). Accordingly, C-MYC was shown to rescue normal human prostate epithelial cells from replicative senescence (presumably via upregulation of the catalytic subunit of the telomerase reverse transcriptase) ( Gil et al. , 2005 ). Importantly, human prostate epithelial-MYC cells were still undergoing senescence-like growth arrest in response to oncogenic Ras ( Gil et al. , 2005 ). In addition, when this paper was in preparation, Wu et al. , 2007 demonstrated that inactivation of C-MYC resulted in induction of senescence phenotypes in several mouse tumor models, including lymphoma, osteosarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. These phenotypes were not suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of MEK, but depended on p16INK4A or p53. Conversely, in one special case (fibroblasts from Werner syndrome patients that lack a conserved RecQ helicase encoded by WRN gene), C-MYC overexpression was shown to actually induce senescence ( Grandori et al. , 2003 ). Therefore, our data and those of others suggest that the role of C-MYC in senescence of human cells is complex and depends on possibly overlapping pathways, the nature of which could be cell type- and/or tumor-dependent. In summary, our study has identified that BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-specific senescence programs exist in a dormant state in advanced melanoma cells and that one of the major functions of C-MYC overexpression during melanoma progression is to continuously suppress such senescence.  Discussion Oncogene-induced senescence in normal cells is emerging as a fail-safe mechanism for suppressing tumor development at a pre-malignant stage ( Bringold and Serrano, 2000 ; Collado and Serrano, 2006 ; Haluska et al. , 2006 ; Ha et al. , 2007 ).

Second, in all cases, senescence phenotypes were p53- or p16INK4A-independent, in contrast to what is commonly seen in rodent cells. In fact, the contribution of these tumor suppressors to the premature senescence of normal human cells is still under debate.

Interestingly, in melanomas from non-chronically sun-damaged skin, NRAS mutations are less common than BRAF mutations ( Curtin et al. , 2005 ). One of the possible explanations for this observation could be that in the course of melanoma progression, senescence induced by activated NRAS is less likely to be overcome than that induced by activated BRAF. Our in vitro data on co-expression of C-MYC with BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R in normal melanocytes support this scenario. C-MYC has been implicated in opposing senescence that is not induced by oncogenes. Indeed, a recent study by Guney et al. (2006) demonstrated that 50% depletion of C-MYC in normal human fibroblasts ectopically expressing telomerase reverse transcriptase resulted in the premature induction of senescence after five passages. Similarly, continuous partial inhibition of C-MYC in M14 melanoma cells (over a period of seven passages) was reported to induce cell crisis associated with telomere shortening, apoptosis and increased activity of SA-?-Gal ( Biroccio et al. 2003 ). Accordingly, C-MYC was shown to rescue normal human prostate epithelial cells from replicative senescence (presumably via upregulation of the catalytic subunit of the telomerase reverse transcriptase) ( Gil et al. , 2005 ). Importantly, human prostate epithelial-MYC cells were still undergoing senescence-like growth arrest in response to oncogenic Ras ( Gil et al. , 2005 ). In addition, when this paper was in preparation, Wu et al. , 2007 demonstrated that inactivation of C-MYC resulted in induction of senescence phenotypes in several mouse tumor models, including lymphoma, osteosarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. These phenotypes were not suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of MEK, but depended on p16INK4A or p53. Conversely, in one special case (fibroblasts from Werner syndrome patients that lack a conserved RecQ helicase encoded by WRN gene), C-MYC overexpression was shown to actually induce senescence ( Grandori et al. , 2003 ). Therefore, our data and those of others suggest that the role of C-MYC in senescence of human cells is complex and depends on possibly overlapping pathways, the nature of which could be cell type- and/or tumor-dependent. In summary, our study has identified that BRAFV600E- or NRASQ61R-specific senescence programs exist in a dormant state in advanced melanoma cells and that one of the major functions of C-MYC overexpression during melanoma progression is to continuously suppress such senescence.
