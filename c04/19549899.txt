Plasminogen Kringle 5 Induces Apoptosis of Brain Microvessel Endothelial Cells: Sensitization by Radiation and Requirement for GRP78 and LRP1 Recombinant plasminogen kringle 5 (rK5) has been shown to induce apoptosis of dermal microvessel endothelial cells (MvEC) in a manner that requires glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78). As we are interested in anti-angiogenic therapy for glioblastoma tumors, and the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic therapy can be enhanced when combined with radiation, we investigated the pro-apoptotic effects of rK5 combined with radiation on brain MvEC. We found that rK5 treatment of brain MvEC induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and that prior irradiation significantly sensitized (500-fold) the cells to rK5-induced apoptosis. The rK5-induced apoptosis of both unirradiated and irradiated MvEC required expression of GRP78 and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), a scavenger receptor, based on downregulation studies with small interfering RNA, and blocking studies with either a GRP78 antibody or a competitive inhibitor of ligand binding to LRP1. Furthermore, p38 MAP kinase was found to be a necessary downstream effector for rK5-induced apoptosis. These data suggest that irradiation sensitizes brain MvEC to the rK5-induced apoptosis and that this signal requires LRP1 internalization of GRP78 and the activation of p38 MAP kinase. Our findings suggest that prior irradiation would have a dose-sparing effect on rK5 anti-angiogenic therapy for brain tumors and further suggest that the effects of rK5 would be tumor-specific as the expression of GRP78 protein is upregulated on the brain MvEC in glioblastoma tumor biopsies as compared to the normal brain.  INTRODUCTION Glioblastoma tumors have a dismal prognosis with a median survival of 12 to 15 months. As the tumors typically exhibit angiogenesis ( 1 – 3 ), anti-angiogenic therapy may represent an effective therapeutic strategy. In this study we investigated the pro-apoptotic effect of the recombinant form of the fifth kringle domain of plasminogen (rK5) on human brain microvessel endothelial cells (MvEC). Irradiation is known to promote the ability of other anti-angiogenic agents to inhibit tumor growth ( 4 – 6 ) and irradiation is a standard initial therapy for patients with glioblastoma tumors ( 2 ); therefore, we also investigated the potential promotion of rK5-induced apoptosis of brain MvEC by irradiation. It has been shown previously that rK5 induces changes indicative of apoptosis in non-brain MvEC ( 7 , 8 ) and inhibits proliferation of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-stimulated calf pulmonary arterial endothelial cells and bovine adrenal capillary endothelial cells ( 8 , 9 ). The ability of rK5 to inhibit neovascularization has been demonstrated directly in a rat model of hyperoxia-induced retinal neovascularization ( 10 ). Moreover, stable expression of K5 in U-87MG glioblastoma cells prior to their s.c. propagation in nude mice resulted in inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth ( 11 ) and inhibition of angiogenesis was seen when colorectal carcinoma cells stably expressing K5 were propagated s.c. in athymic nude mice ( 12 ). The cell surface binding protein for rK5 on dermal MvEC is glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) ( 7 ). GRP78 is a member of the heat shock protein (HSP) 70 family, and its upregulation is part of the general cellular defense mechanism of stressed cells that is referred to as the unfolded protein response (reviewed in 13); ( 14 ). The increased expression of members of the unfolded protein response in tumors suggests they may be promising therapeutic targets (reviewed in 15). GRP78 associates with the scavenger receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) on the cell surface ( 16 ). LRP1 is known to signal upon associating with and internalizing its ligands ( 17 – 20 ). The biologic consequences of its internalization are varied and depend on which one of approximately 30 different ligands it binds (reviewed in 21,22); ( 23 ), as well as its association with other cell surface proteins, the cell type, and the experimental conditions ( 16 , 20 , 24 , 25 ). As the rK5 inhibition of retinal capillary endothelial cell proliferation was unaffected by RGD-containing peptides ( 10 ), it likely occurs in an integrin receptor-independent manner. We found that rK5 induces apoptosis of brain MvEC and that prior irradiation significantly sensitizes the cells to rK5-induced apoptosis resulting in a dose-sparing effect. In both unirradiated and irradiated brain MvEC, the rK5-induced apoptosis requires expression of GRP78 and LRP1, as well as the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase.

RESULTS rK5 induces apoptosis of primary human brain MvEC rK5 treatment has been shown to induce apoptosis of dermal MvEC ( 7 ). To determine the potential of rK5 treatment to induce apoptosis of brain MvEC, we treated primary human brain MvEC plated onto collagen type IV and grown in complete media (10% FBS) in the presence of VEGF (10 ng/ml) and bFGF (5 ng/ml) with rK5 at concentrations of 10 to 5000 ng/ml for 17 h. We found that 5000 ng/ml of rK5 was necessary to induce a significant increase in the numbers of TUNEL-positive human brain MvEC (? 8% positive) at 17 h ( Fig.1A ). Immunoblotting analysis as well as caspase 3/7 activity analysis confirmed that treatment of the cells with 5000 ng/ml rK5 for 17 h resulted in a significant increase in cleaved caspase-7, and that treatment for time periods greater than 17 h (25 and 40 h) did not result in a further increase in the amounts of cleaved caspase-7 (data not shown). Irradiation sensitizes primary human brain MvEC to rK5-induced apoptosis To evaluate the effect of prior irradiation on rK5-induced apoptosis of brain MvEC, we irradiated (2 or 5 Gy) primary human brain MvEC, allowed the cells to recover for 20 h, then re-plated them onto collagen-coated wells for 4 h prior to treatment with rK5 for 17 h. In the absence of treatment with rK5, only a low percentage of brain MvEC that were irradiated exhibited TUNEL positivity ( Fig. 1B ). Notably, the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in the brain MvEC that had been irradiated prior to treatment with 10 ng/ml of rK5 was similar to the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in unirradiated MvEC that were treated with 5000 ng/ml of rK5 ( Fig. 1B ). Thus, the prior irradiation appeared to increase the sensitivity of the cells to rK5, i.e ., the irradiation had a dose sparing effect, but did not seem to increase the numbers of cells that were susceptible to rK5. Similarly, irradiation of the brain MvEC (2 or 5 Gy) followed by rK5 treatment (3 – 5000 ng/ml, 17 h) resulted in a significant increase in the cleavage of caspase-3 or 7 that was maximal at 10 ng/ml rK5 ( Fig. 1C , and data not shown) confirming that irradiation plus rK5 induces apoptosis. Consistent with the results of the TUNEL assays, irradiation alone (5 Gy) did not induce a significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 ( Supplemental Fig. 1A ). The time course of rK5-induced caspase-7 cleavage in the irradiated brain MvEC was maximal at 17 h and detectable as early as 3 h post-rK5 treatment ( Fig 1D ). Collectively, these data establish that prior irradiation of the brain MvEC resulted in a significant reduction in the dose of rK5 required for optimal induction of apoptosis. GRP78 is necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis of unirradiated and irradiated primary human brain MvEC Analysis of the expression of GRP78 on the cell surface of the MvEC used in the analyses of rK5-induced apoptosis was determined by cell surface biotinylation followed by detergent lysis, immunoprecipitation with anti-GRP78 antibody and SDS-PAGE analysis. The data indicated that GRP78 was expressed on both unirradiated and irradiated human brain MvEC ( Fig. 2A ). Although irradiation has been reported to upregulate GRP78 ( 31 ), we found that the surface expression was equivalent in the irradiated and unirradiated brain MvEC ( Fig 2A ) suggesting that an upregulation of GRP78 does not contribute to the enhanced sensitivity of the irradiated brain MvEC to low doses of rK5 in our experiments. After further confirming the cell surface expression of GRP78 on the brain MvEC by FACS analysis (data not shown), we determined the requirement for GRP78 in rK5-induced apoptosis by downregulating GRP78 with specific duplex siRNA. As a control, we downregulated the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein calreticulin, which is expressed, in part, on the cell surface ( 19 ) or we downregulated HSP70. Downregulation of GRP78 and calreticulin was confirmed by western blotting ( Supplemental Fig. 1B ) and we had established previously that HSP70 protein is downregulated by >70% with 50 nM siHSP70 treatment in the unirradiated human brain MvEC (data not shown). No adverse effects of the siRNAs on cell viability or morphology were detected over the time course of these experiments (data not shown). The downregulation of GRP78 significantly blocked rK5-induced apoptosis (5000 ng/ml; 17 h) of the unirradiated brain MvEC as determined using a TUNEL assay and blotting for cleaved caspase-3 ( Fig. 2B ), whereas the downregulation of calreticulin or HSP70 had no effect. Similar results were obtained on downregulation of GRP78 in irradiated cells. Downregulation of GRP78 (> 70%) was achieved on treatment of the irradiated brain MvEC with 50 nM siGRP78 ( Supplemental Fig. 1C ). Downregulation of GRP78 in the irradiated brain MvEC significantly blocked rK5-induced apoptosis (10 ng/ml rK5; 17 h) as detected using the TUNEL assay and blotting for cleaved caspase-7 ( Fig 2C ). The downregulation of HSP70 had no effect. Further support for a role for GRP78 in rK5-induced apoptosis of the irradiated brain MvEC was obtained by the results of treatment with an anti-GRP78 antibody (10 µg/ml) that is directed toward the N-terminus. This inhibited rK5-induced apoptosis (data not shown) as described previously for unirradiated dermal MvEC ( 7 ). These data indicate that GRP78 is necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis of both unirradiated and irradiated primary human brain MvEC. LRP1 is necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis of unirradiated and irradiated human brain MvEC GRP78 is known to associate with LRP1 on the cell surface ( 16 ); therefore we examined the potential role of LRP1 in rK5-induced apoptosis of MvEC. The expression of LRP1 on the cell surface was verified using cell surface biotinylation, followed by detergent lysis and immunoprecipitation with a mAb anti-LRP1, which recognizes the 85-kDa light chain. SDS-PAGE analysis of the immunoprecipitates indicated that LRP1 is expressed on the surface of both the unirradiated and irradiated MvEC, and further indicated the levels of expression of LRP1 on the cell surface were not altered by irradiation ( Supplemental Fig. 2A ). To determine whether LRP1 is required for the rK5-induced apoptosis of the human brain MvEC, we pretreated the cells with receptor associated protein (RAP), a competitive inhibitor of ligand binding to LRP1 ( 32 ). Prior addition of 60 nM rec-RAP blocked rK5-induced apoptosis in the irradiated and unirradiated cells as detected using the TUNEL assay and cleavage of caspase-3 ( Fig 3A&B , respectively). These results were confirmed by downregulation of LRP1 with pooled specific duplex siRNA. Downregulation was confirmed by western blotting of the irradiated and unirradiated cells ( Supplemental Fig. 2B&C , respectively) and no effect of siLRP1 administration on cell viability or morphology was detected over the time course of these experiments. Downregulation of LRP1 post-irradiation blocked rK5-induced apoptosis (10 ng/ml), whereas the downregulation of HSP70 as a control had no effect ( Fig 3C ). In the unirradiated cells, downregulation of LRP1 significantly blocked the rK5-induced apoptosis (5000 ng/ml), whereas the downregulation of calreticulin had no effect ( Fig. 3D ). These data suggest that LRP1 internalization of GRP78 is likely necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis in both the irradiated and the unirradiated brain MvEC. p38 MAP kinase is necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis of the irradiated human brain MvEC Stress is known to induce the activation of p38 MAP kinase ( 33 ) and p38 MAP kinase can promote a pro-apoptotic signal ( 34 – 36 ). We found a time-dependent increase in phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase in the irradiated cells treated with rK5 ( Fig. 4A ). Treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase (SB202190) at 2.5-fold the IC50 (1.5 µM), significantly blocked the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 in the irradiated brain MvEC ( Fig. 4B ). In contrast, the pro-apoptotic effects of rK5 were not blocked by treatment with inhibitors of other kinases at 2.5-fold the IC50: 5 µM PD98059 (MEK inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), and FR180204 (Erk inhibitor) ( Fig 4B ). To further evaluate the requirement for p38 MAPK in the irradiated MvEC we downregulated p38 MAPK with pooled specific duplex siRNA and downregulated Erk1 as a control ( Supplemental Fig. 3A ). TUNEL analysis indicated that the downregulation of p38 MAPK in the irradiated brain MvEC blocked the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 ( Fig. 4C ), whereas the downregulation of Erk1 had no effect. On analysis of the unirradiated cells, we also found that the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 at 2.5 fold the IC50 significantly blocked the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 ( Fig 5A , lanes 2&3) whereas the Erk inhibitor FR180204 did not ( Fig 5A , lanes 2&4). Similarly, downregulation of p38 MAP kinase in the unirradiated cells ( Supplemental Fig. 3B ) blocked the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 as detected by TUNEL assay, whereas the downregulation of Erk1 had no significant effect ( Fig 5B ). These data suggest that p38 MAP kinase is a necessary downstream signaling effector in the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 in irradiated and unirradiated human brain MvEC. Although JNK has been reported to be involved in signaling that promotes apoptosis ( 34 ), we found that the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, at 2.5-fold the IC50 in the irradiated cells ( Fig. 4B ) or the unirradiated cells ( Fig. 5A ) did not block the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5. However, a small increase (30%) in phosphorylation of the 54-kDa JNK2 isoform was detected in a time course analysis of JNK phosphorylation post-rK5 treatment of the unirradiated cells (data not shown). Downregulation of JNK2 with 200 nM specific duplex siJNK2 RNA (70% downregulation of the 54-kDa isoform) followed by TUNEL assay confirmed that downregulation of JNK2 in the unirradiated cells did not block the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 (5000 ng/ml) (data not shown). GRP78 expression is higher on brain MvEC in glioblastoma tumor samples as compared to the normal brain As our ultimate goal is to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma tumors, we evaluated the expression of GRP78 in frozen and paraffin sections of 14 glioblastoma tumor biopsy samples by immunohistochemistry. We found moderate (2+) expression of GRP78 in an estimated 30% of MvEC in the tumor portion of all glioblastoma samples (n=14) and moderate (2+) expression in 30% of tumor cells ( Fig. 6A ). The staining localized to the cell membrane and the cytoplasm. The staining was specific for GRP78 as it was largely competed out by preincubation of the anti-GRP78 antibody with a 50-fold molar excess of GRP78 peptide (data not shown). Staining with rabbit IgG was used as a negative control and staining with anti-vWf antibody was used as a positive control. Using this technique GRP78 expression was below the limit of detection in endothelial and glial cells in the frozen and paraffin sections of normal brain (n=13), although low (1+) expression of GRP78 was detected in neurons in the normal brain (data not shown). To confirm the upregulation of GRP78 in the tumors as compared to the normal brain, we immunoblotted lysates from nine normal brains and nine glioblastoma tumor samples with anti-GRP78 antibody, followed by stripping and reprobing with antibodies directed toward GAPDH and HSP70. The immunoblotting data were quantitated by densitometric analysis and GRP78 expression was normalized to HSP70 and to GAPDH and plotted as bar graphs ( Figure 6B ). We found on average a 2.0 to 2.5-fold increase in GRP78 expression relative to HSP70 or when normalized to GAPDH in the nine tumor samples as compared to the nine normal brain (NB) samples (GRP78/HSP70 densitometry ratio: NB mean = 0.38 ± 0.06, GBM mean = 0.92 ± 0.2 with p<0.05; GRP78/GAPDH densitometry ratio: NB mean = 0.36 ± 0.05, GBM mean = 1.15 ± 0.3 with p<0.05). These data support our immunohistochemistry results indicating that GRP78 expression is upregulated in glioblastoma tumors in vivo .  RESULTS rK5 induces apoptosis of primary human brain MvEC rK5 treatment has been shown to induce apoptosis of dermal MvEC ( 7 ). To determine the potential of rK5 treatment to induce apoptosis of brain MvEC, we treated primary human brain MvEC plated onto collagen type IV and grown in complete media (10% FBS) in the presence of VEGF (10 ng/ml) and bFGF (5 ng/ml) with rK5 at concentrations of 10 to 5000 ng/ml for 17 h. We found that 5000 ng/ml of rK5 was necessary to induce a significant increase in the numbers of TUNEL-positive human brain MvEC (? 8% positive) at 17 h ( Fig.1A ). Immunoblotting analysis as well as caspase 3/7 activity analysis confirmed that treatment of the cells with 5000 ng/ml rK5 for 17 h resulted in a significant increase in cleaved caspase-7, and that treatment for time periods greater than 17 h (25 and 40 h) did not result in a further increase in the amounts of cleaved caspase-7 (data not shown). Irradiation sensitizes primary human brain MvEC to rK5-induced apoptosis To evaluate the effect of prior irradiation on rK5-induced apoptosis of brain MvEC, we irradiated (2 or 5 Gy) primary human brain MvEC, allowed the cells to recover for 20 h, then re-plated them onto collagen-coated wells for 4 h prior to treatment with rK5 for 17 h.

Thus, the prior irradiation appeared to increase the sensitivity of the cells to rK5, i.e ., the irradiation had a dose sparing effect, but did not seem to increase the numbers of cells that were susceptible to rK5. Similarly, irradiation of the brain MvEC (2 or 5 Gy) followed by rK5 treatment (3 – 5000 ng/ml, 17 h) resulted in a significant increase in the cleavage of caspase-3 or 7 that was maximal at 10 ng/ml rK5 ( Fig. 1C , and data not shown) confirming that irradiation plus rK5 induces apoptosis. Consistent with the results of the TUNEL assays, irradiation alone (5 Gy) did not induce a significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 ( Supplemental Fig. 1A ). The time course of rK5-induced caspase-7 cleavage in the irradiated brain MvEC was maximal at 17 h and detectable as early as 3 h post-rK5 treatment ( Fig 1D ). Collectively, these data establish that prior irradiation of the brain MvEC resulted in a significant reduction in the dose of rK5 required for optimal induction of apoptosis. GRP78 is necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis of unirradiated and irradiated primary human brain MvEC Analysis of the expression of GRP78 on the cell surface of the MvEC used in the analyses of rK5-induced apoptosis was determined by cell surface biotinylation followed by detergent lysis, immunoprecipitation with anti-GRP78 antibody and SDS-PAGE analysis.

Although irradiation has been reported to upregulate GRP78 ( 31 ), we found that the surface expression was equivalent in the irradiated and unirradiated brain MvEC ( Fig 2A ) suggesting that an upregulation of GRP78 does not contribute to the enhanced sensitivity of the irradiated brain MvEC to low doses of rK5 in our experiments. After further confirming the cell surface expression of GRP78 on the brain MvEC by FACS analysis (data not shown), we determined the requirement for GRP78 in rK5-induced apoptosis by downregulating GRP78 with specific duplex siRNA. As a control, we downregulated the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein calreticulin, which is expressed, in part, on the cell surface ( 19 ) or we downregulated HSP70. Downregulation of GRP78 and calreticulin was confirmed by western blotting ( Supplemental Fig. 1B ) and we had established previously that HSP70 protein is downregulated by >70% with 50 nM siHSP70 treatment in the unirradiated human brain MvEC (data not shown). No adverse effects of the siRNAs on cell viability or morphology were detected over the time course of these experiments (data not shown). The downregulation of GRP78 significantly blocked rK5-induced apoptosis (5000 ng/ml; 17 h) of the unirradiated brain MvEC as determined using a TUNEL assay and blotting for cleaved caspase-3 ( Fig. 2B ), whereas the downregulation of calreticulin or HSP70 had no effect. Similar results were obtained on downregulation of GRP78 in irradiated cells. Downregulation of GRP78 (> 70%) was achieved on treatment of the irradiated brain MvEC with 50 nM siGRP78 ( Supplemental Fig. 1C ). Downregulation of GRP78 in the irradiated brain MvEC significantly blocked rK5-induced apoptosis (10 ng/ml rK5; 17 h) as detected using the TUNEL assay and blotting for cleaved caspase-7 ( Fig 2C ). The downregulation of HSP70 had no effect. Further support for a role for GRP78 in rK5-induced apoptosis of the irradiated brain MvEC was obtained by the results of treatment with an anti-GRP78 antibody (10 µg/ml) that is directed toward the N-terminus. This inhibited rK5-induced apoptosis (data not shown) as described previously for unirradiated dermal MvEC ( 7 ). These data indicate that GRP78 is necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis of both unirradiated and irradiated primary human brain MvEC. LRP1 is necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis of unirradiated and irradiated human brain MvEC GRP78 is known to associate with LRP1 on the cell surface ( 16 ); therefore we examined the potential role of LRP1 in rK5-induced apoptosis of MvEC. The expression of LRP1 on the cell surface was verified using cell surface biotinylation, followed by detergent lysis and immunoprecipitation with a mAb anti-LRP1, which recognizes the 85-kDa light chain. SDS-PAGE analysis of the immunoprecipitates indicated that LRP1 is expressed on the surface of both the unirradiated and irradiated MvEC, and further indicated the levels of expression of LRP1 on the cell surface were not altered by irradiation ( Supplemental Fig. 2A ). To determine whether LRP1 is required for the rK5-induced apoptosis of the human brain MvEC, we pretreated the cells with receptor associated protein (RAP), a competitive inhibitor of ligand binding to LRP1 ( 32 ). Prior addition of 60 nM rec-RAP blocked rK5-induced apoptosis in the irradiated and unirradiated cells as detected using the TUNEL assay and cleavage of caspase-3 ( Fig 3A&B , respectively). These results were confirmed by downregulation of LRP1 with pooled specific duplex siRNA. Downregulation was confirmed by western blotting of the irradiated and unirradiated cells ( Supplemental Fig. 2B&C , respectively) and no effect of siLRP1 administration on cell viability or morphology was detected over the time course of these experiments. Downregulation of LRP1 post-irradiation blocked rK5-induced apoptosis (10 ng/ml), whereas the downregulation of HSP70 as a control had no effect ( Fig 3C ). In the unirradiated cells, downregulation of LRP1 significantly blocked the rK5-induced apoptosis (5000 ng/ml), whereas the downregulation of calreticulin had no effect ( Fig. 3D ). These data suggest that LRP1 internalization of GRP78 is likely necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis in both the irradiated and the unirradiated brain MvEC. p38 MAP kinase is necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis of the irradiated human brain MvEC Stress is known to induce the activation of p38 MAP kinase ( 33 ) and p38 MAP kinase can promote a pro-apoptotic signal ( 34 – 36 ). We found a time-dependent increase in phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase in the irradiated cells treated with rK5 ( Fig. 4A ). Treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase (SB202190) at 2.5-fold the IC50 (1.5 µM), significantly blocked the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 in the irradiated brain MvEC ( Fig. 4B ). In contrast, the pro-apoptotic effects of rK5 were not blocked by treatment with inhibitors of other kinases at 2.5-fold the IC50: 5 µM PD98059 (MEK inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), and FR180204 (Erk inhibitor) ( Fig 4B ). To further evaluate the requirement for p38 MAPK in the irradiated MvEC we downregulated p38 MAPK with pooled specific duplex siRNA and downregulated Erk1 as a control ( Supplemental Fig. 3A ). TUNEL analysis indicated that the downregulation of p38 MAPK in the irradiated brain MvEC blocked the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 ( Fig. 4C ), whereas the downregulation of Erk1 had no effect. On analysis of the unirradiated cells, we also found that the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 at 2.5 fold the IC50 significantly blocked the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 ( Fig 5A , lanes 2&3) whereas the Erk inhibitor FR180204 did not ( Fig 5A , lanes 2&4). Similarly, downregulation of p38 MAP kinase in the unirradiated cells ( Supplemental Fig. 3B ) blocked the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 as detected by TUNEL assay, whereas the downregulation of Erk1 had no significant effect ( Fig 5B ). These data suggest that p38 MAP kinase is a necessary downstream signaling effector in the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 in irradiated and unirradiated human brain MvEC. Although JNK has been reported to be involved in signaling that promotes apoptosis ( 34 ), we found that the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, at 2.5-fold the IC50 in the irradiated cells ( Fig. 4B ) or the unirradiated cells ( Fig. 5A ) did not block the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5. However, a small increase (30%) in phosphorylation of the 54-kDa JNK2 isoform was detected in a time course analysis of JNK phosphorylation post-rK5 treatment of the unirradiated cells (data not shown). Downregulation of JNK2 with 200 nM specific duplex siJNK2 RNA (70% downregulation of the 54-kDa isoform) followed by TUNEL assay confirmed that downregulation of JNK2 in the unirradiated cells did not block the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 (5000 ng/ml) (data not shown). GRP78 expression is higher on brain MvEC in glioblastoma tumor samples as compared to the normal brain As our ultimate goal is to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma tumors, we evaluated the expression of GRP78 in frozen and paraffin sections of 14 glioblastoma tumor biopsy samples by immunohistochemistry. We found moderate (2+) expression of GRP78 in an estimated 30% of MvEC in the tumor portion of all glioblastoma samples (n=14) and moderate (2+) expression in 30% of tumor cells ( Fig. 6A ). The staining localized to the cell membrane and the cytoplasm. The staining was specific for GRP78 as it was largely competed out by preincubation of the anti-GRP78 antibody with a 50-fold molar excess of GRP78 peptide (data not shown). Staining with rabbit IgG was used as a negative control and staining with anti-vWf antibody was used as a positive control. Using this technique GRP78 expression was below the limit of detection in endothelial and glial cells in the frozen and paraffin sections of normal brain (n=13), although low (1+) expression of GRP78 was detected in neurons in the normal brain (data not shown). To confirm the upregulation of GRP78 in the tumors as compared to the normal brain, we immunoblotted lysates from nine normal brains and nine glioblastoma tumor samples with anti-GRP78 antibody, followed by stripping and reprobing with antibodies directed toward GAPDH and HSP70. The immunoblotting data were quantitated by densitometric analysis and GRP78 expression was normalized to HSP70 and to GAPDH and plotted as bar graphs ( Figure 6B ). We found on average a 2.0 to 2.5-fold increase in GRP78 expression relative to HSP70 or when normalized to GAPDH in the nine tumor samples as compared to the nine normal brain (NB) samples (GRP78/HSP70 densitometry ratio: NB mean = 0.38 ± 0.06, GBM mean = 0.92 ± 0.2 with p<0.05; GRP78/GAPDH densitometry ratio: NB mean = 0.36 ± 0.05, GBM mean = 1.15 ± 0.3 with p<0.05). These data support our immunohistochemistry results indicating that GRP78 expression is upregulated in glioblastoma tumors in vivo .  rK5 induces apoptosis of primary human brain MvEC rK5 treatment has been shown to induce apoptosis of dermal MvEC ( 7 ). To determine the potential of rK5 treatment to induce apoptosis of brain MvEC, we treated primary human brain MvEC plated onto collagen type IV and grown in complete media (10% FBS) in the presence of VEGF (10 ng/ml) and bFGF (5 ng/ml) with rK5 at concentrations of 10 to 5000 ng/ml for 17 h. We found that 5000 ng/ml of rK5 was necessary to induce a significant increase in the numbers of TUNEL-positive human brain MvEC (? 8% positive) at 17 h ( Fig.1A ). Immunoblotting analysis as well as caspase 3/7 activity analysis confirmed that treatment of the cells with 5000 ng/ml rK5 for 17 h resulted in a significant increase in cleaved caspase-7, and that treatment for time periods greater than 17 h (25 and 40 h) did not result in a further increase in the amounts of cleaved caspase-7 (data not shown).  rK5 induces apoptosis of primary human brain MvEC rK5 treatment has been shown to induce apoptosis of dermal MvEC ( 7 ). To determine the potential of rK5 treatment to induce apoptosis of brain MvEC, we treated primary human brain MvEC plated onto collagen type IV and grown in complete media (10% FBS) in the presence of VEGF (10 ng/ml) and bFGF (5 ng/ml) with rK5 at concentrations of 10 to 5000 ng/ml for 17 h. We found that 5000 ng/ml of rK5 was necessary to induce a significant increase in the numbers of TUNEL-positive human brain MvEC (? 8% positive) at 17 h ( Fig.1A ). Immunoblotting analysis as well as caspase 3/7 activity analysis confirmed that treatment of the cells with 5000 ng/ml rK5 for 17 h resulted in a significant increase in cleaved caspase-7, and that treatment for time periods greater than 17 h (25 and 40 h) did not result in a further increase in the amounts of cleaved caspase-7 (data not shown).  Irradiation sensitizes primary human brain MvEC to rK5-induced apoptosis To evaluate the effect of prior irradiation on rK5-induced apoptosis of brain MvEC, we irradiated (2 or 5 Gy) primary human brain MvEC, allowed the cells to recover for 20 h, then re-plated them onto collagen-coated wells for 4 h prior to treatment with rK5 for 17 h. In the absence of treatment with rK5, only a low percentage of brain MvEC that were irradiated exhibited TUNEL positivity ( Fig. 1B ). Notably, the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in the brain MvEC that had been irradiated prior to treatment with 10 ng/ml of rK5 was similar to the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in unirradiated MvEC that were treated with 5000 ng/ml of rK5 ( Fig. 1B ). Thus, the prior irradiation appeared to increase the sensitivity of the cells to rK5, i.e ., the irradiation had a dose sparing effect, but did not seem to increase the numbers of cells that were susceptible to rK5. Similarly, irradiation of the brain MvEC (2 or 5 Gy) followed by rK5 treatment (3 – 5000 ng/ml, 17 h) resulted in a significant increase in the cleavage of caspase-3 or 7 that was maximal at 10 ng/ml rK5 ( Fig. 1C , and data not shown) confirming that irradiation plus rK5 induces apoptosis. Consistent with the results of the TUNEL assays, irradiation alone (5 Gy) did not induce a significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 ( Supplemental Fig. 1A ). The time course of rK5-induced caspase-7 cleavage in the irradiated brain MvEC was maximal at 17 h and detectable as early as 3 h post-rK5 treatment ( Fig 1D ). Collectively, these data establish that prior irradiation of the brain MvEC resulted in a significant reduction in the dose of rK5 required for optimal induction of apoptosis.

Collectively, these data establish that prior irradiation of the brain MvEC resulted in a significant reduction in the dose of rK5 required for optimal induction of apoptosis.  GRP78 is necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis of unirradiated and irradiated primary human brain MvEC Analysis of the expression of GRP78 on the cell surface of the MvEC used in the analyses of rK5-induced apoptosis was determined by cell surface biotinylation followed by detergent lysis, immunoprecipitation with anti-GRP78 antibody and SDS-PAGE analysis. The data indicated that GRP78 was expressed on both unirradiated and irradiated human brain MvEC ( Fig. 2A ). Although irradiation has been reported to upregulate GRP78 ( 31 ), we found that the surface expression was equivalent in the irradiated and unirradiated brain MvEC ( Fig 2A ) suggesting that an upregulation of GRP78 does not contribute to the enhanced sensitivity of the irradiated brain MvEC to low doses of rK5 in our experiments.

These results were confirmed by downregulation of LRP1 with pooled specific duplex siRNA. Downregulation was confirmed by western blotting of the irradiated and unirradiated cells ( Supplemental Fig. 2B&C , respectively) and no effect of siLRP1 administration on cell viability or morphology was detected over the time course of these experiments. Downregulation of LRP1 post-irradiation blocked rK5-induced apoptosis (10 ng/ml), whereas the downregulation of HSP70 as a control had no effect ( Fig 3C ). In the unirradiated cells, downregulation of LRP1 significantly blocked the rK5-induced apoptosis (5000 ng/ml), whereas the downregulation of calreticulin had no effect ( Fig. 3D ).

We found a time-dependent increase in phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase in the irradiated cells treated with rK5 ( Fig. 4A ). Treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase (SB202190) at 2.5-fold the IC50 (1.5 µM), significantly blocked the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 in the irradiated brain MvEC ( Fig. 4B ). In contrast, the pro-apoptotic effects of rK5 were not blocked by treatment with inhibitors of other kinases at 2.5-fold the IC50: 5 µM PD98059 (MEK inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), and FR180204 (Erk inhibitor) ( Fig 4B ). To further evaluate the requirement for p38 MAPK in the irradiated MvEC we downregulated p38 MAPK with pooled specific duplex siRNA and downregulated Erk1 as a control ( Supplemental Fig. 3A ). TUNEL analysis indicated that the downregulation of p38 MAPK in the irradiated brain MvEC blocked the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 ( Fig. 4C ), whereas the downregulation of Erk1 had no effect.

However, a small increase (30%) in phosphorylation of the 54-kDa JNK2 isoform was detected in a time course analysis of JNK phosphorylation post-rK5 treatment of the unirradiated cells (data not shown). Downregulation of JNK2 with 200 nM specific duplex siJNK2 RNA (70% downregulation of the 54-kDa isoform) followed by TUNEL assay confirmed that downregulation of JNK2 in the unirradiated cells did not block the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 (5000 ng/ml) (data not shown).  p38 MAP kinase is necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis of the irradiated human brain MvEC Stress is known to induce the activation of p38 MAP kinase ( 33 ) and p38 MAP kinase can promote a pro-apoptotic signal ( 34 – 36 ).

We found on average a 2.0 to 2.5-fold increase in GRP78 expression relative to HSP70 or when normalized to GAPDH in the nine tumor samples as compared to the nine normal brain (NB) samples (GRP78/HSP70 densitometry ratio: NB mean = 0.38 ± 0.06, GBM mean = 0.92 ± 0.2 with p<0.05; GRP78/GAPDH densitometry ratio: NB mean = 0.36 ± 0.05, GBM mean = 1.15 ± 0.3 with p<0.05). These data support our immunohistochemistry results indicating that GRP78 expression is upregulated in glioblastoma tumors in vivo .  GRP78 expression is higher on brain MvEC in glioblastoma tumor samples as compared to the normal brain As our ultimate goal is to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma tumors, we evaluated the expression of GRP78 in frozen and paraffin sections of 14 glioblastoma tumor biopsy samples by immunohistochemistry. We found moderate (2+) expression of GRP78 in an estimated 30% of MvEC in the tumor portion of all glioblastoma samples (n=14) and moderate (2+) expression in 30% of tumor cells ( Fig. 6A ). The staining localized to the cell membrane and the cytoplasm. The staining was specific for GRP78 as it was largely competed out by preincubation of the anti-GRP78 antibody with a 50-fold molar excess of GRP78 peptide (data not shown). Staining with rabbit IgG was used as a negative control and staining with anti-vWf antibody was used as a positive control. Using this technique GRP78 expression was below the limit of detection in endothelial and glial cells in the frozen and paraffin sections of normal brain (n=13), although low (1+) expression of GRP78 was detected in neurons in the normal brain (data not shown). To confirm the upregulation of GRP78 in the tumors as compared to the normal brain, we immunoblotted lysates from nine normal brains and nine glioblastoma tumor samples with anti-GRP78 antibody, followed by stripping and reprobing with antibodies directed toward GAPDH and HSP70. The immunoblotting data were quantitated by densitometric analysis and GRP78 expression was normalized to HSP70 and to GAPDH and plotted as bar graphs ( Figure 6B ). We found on average a 2.0 to 2.5-fold increase in GRP78 expression relative to HSP70 or when normalized to GAPDH in the nine tumor samples as compared to the nine normal brain (NB) samples (GRP78/HSP70 densitometry ratio: NB mean = 0.38 ± 0.06, GBM mean = 0.92 ± 0.2 with p<0.05; GRP78/GAPDH densitometry ratio: NB mean = 0.36 ± 0.05, GBM mean = 1.15 ± 0.3 with p<0.05). These data support our immunohistochemistry results indicating that GRP78 expression is upregulated in glioblastoma tumors in vivo .  DISCUSSION In this report we show that rK5 can induce apoptosis of brain MvEC and that irradiation significantly sensitizes primary human brain MvEC to the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5. We found that rK5 treatment of brain MvEC induces apoptosis, as measured by several different assays, when administered at 5000 ng/ml (? 500 nM). This is similar to the dosage of rK5 required to induce apoptosis of dermal MvEC ( 7 ). Importantly, we found that prior irradiation significantly sensitized the brain MvEC to rK5-induced apoptosis, as a 500-fold lower dose of rK5 (10 ng/ml) induced a similar percentage of TUNEL-positive cells and cleavage of caspase-3 or 7. Few studies have focused on irradiation as a potential sensitizing agent for anti-angiogenic therapy. Our studies are consistent with the recent report of Jin et al ., ( 37 ) that rK5 combined with irradiation enhanced the anti-angiogenic effect of rK5 in a mouse tumor model of Lewis lung carcinoma cells propagated s.c.. Under our experimental conditions (10% FBS with 10 ng/ml VEGF and 5 ng/ml bFGF) irradiation alone did not induce significant cell death or caspase 3/7 cleavage. Other investigators have reported a pro-apoptotic effect of irradiation (2 or 5 Gy) alone on dermal MvEC that were propagated and radiated in reduced serum (2% FBS), and this was attributed to reduced levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 ( 38 , 39 ). We did not find an altered level of Bcl2 protein post-irradiation of the MvEC at two time points in our experimental conditions (B.C. McFarland and C.L. Gladson, unpublished observation). This may be due to the higher levels of FBS and added VEGF, as the level of Bcl2 expression is known to be regulated by VEGF ( 39 ) or it may reflect the use of brain MvEC rather than dermal MvEC. rK5 has been reported to induce autophagy of non-brain endothelial cells in different experimental conditions ( 40 ); therefore, it is possible that rK5-induced autophagy contributes to the apoptosis we have observed in the brain MvEC. Our finding that GRP78 is required for rK5-induced apoptosis of human brain MvEC is consistent with the report of the requirement for GRP78 in the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 on dermal MvEC, and of a direct interaction of rK5 with rec-GRP78 ( 7 ). GRP78 is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein that is expressed on the cell surface in stress conditions and in tumors ( 14 , 15 ); however, we found no change in the cell surface expression post-irradiation in the time course and conditions of our experiments. This suggests that an increase in GRP78 expression post-irradiation is not the mechanism by which irradiation sensitizes the cells to rK5-induced apoptosis. The ligand binding to cell surface GRP78 appears to determine the signal generated. We and others ( 7 ) detect a pro-apoptotic signal when rK5 binds to cell surface GRP78 on MvEC, whereas ?2-macroglobulin binding to cell surface GRP78 on human prostate cancer cells and macrophages initiates a pro-proliferation signal ( 41 ). The voltage-dependent ion channel also has been reported to be a receptor for rK5 ( 42 ). We found that LRP1 is necessary for the rK5-generated pro-apoptotic signal. This suggests that LRP1 internalization of GRP78 is likely necessary for the pro-apoptotic effect of rK5 in the brain MvEC. The signal generated upon LRP1 binding and internalizing its ligand is dependent on the cell and the environmental context ( 21 ). For example, a pro-migratory signal is generated when LRP1 binds and internalizes the complex of cell surface calreticulin and thrombospondin-1 in coronary artery endothelial cells ( 19 , 20 ). Differential LRP1 signaling is thought to be due to different adaptor molecules that bind to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue(s) in the LRP1 cytoplasmic tail and thereby activate different downstream effectors ( 21 , 23 , 43 ). We found that p38 MAP kinase was activated with rK5 treatment post-irradiation and that p38 MAP kinase was necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis of the irradiated and unirradiated brain MvEC. In contrast, neither Erk nor JNK were necessary for the rK5-induced apoptosis of the human brain MvEC. Notably, the LRP1 family member LRP8, expressed on platelets, is known to activate p38 MAP kinase upon binding its ligand, the low density lipoprotein, suggesting that the LRP family of proteins is capable of signaling to p38 MAP kinase ( 44 ). In support of the potential clinical relevance of our findings, we show that the expression of GRP78 is increased on the MvEC in glioblastoma tumor samples as compared to the normal brain. GRP78 expression was also increased on the tumor cells in the glioblastoma biopsy samples, as compared to glial cells in the normal brain. Our results are consistent with those in the literature indicating that GRP78 expression is upregulated in tumors (reviewed in ( 15 ); ( 45 , 46 ). Two conditions frequently found in malignant tumors, hypoxia and hypoglycemia, are known to upregulate GRP78 expression ( 14 , 47 ). Recently, GRP78 expression has been associated with chemoresistance making it a promising target for cancer therapy (reviewed in 15); ( 45 , 48 ). In summary, our data indicate that irradiation sensitizes primary human brain MvEC to the apoptosis-inducing effect of rK5 and that this pro-apoptotic signal requires LRP1 internalization of GRP78 and p38 MAP kinase activity. As the cell surface binding partner for rK5 (GRP78) and its scavenger receptor partner (LRP1) ( 49 ) are both expressed on MvEC in glioblastoma tumor biopsy samples, these data suggest that rK5 treatment post-irradiation should be considered in the design of new therapies for patients with glioblastoma tumors.
