Sensitivity study and optimization of a 3D electric impedance tomography prostate probe In current clinical practice, the primary diagnostic method for testing for prostate cancer is ultrasound-guided biopsy. In this paper, we consider using a sonolucent array of electrodes, printed on a thin Kapton layer and positioned on the imaging window of a transrectal ultrasound probe, as a method for providing coregistered electrical and ultrasound imaging of the prostate. As the electrical properties of malignant tissues have been shown to differ significantly from benign tissues, the estimation of the electrical properties is expected to be helpful in distinguishing certain beginning pathologies from cancer and in improving the detection rate that current biopsy methods provide. One of the main difficulties in estimating electrical properties of tissues with this electrode configuration is the rapid decay of the sensitivity with distance from the sensing array. In order to partially overcome this difficulty, we propose to use prior information from the ultrasound (US). Specifically we intend to delineate the boundaries of the prostate from the US, to subdivide the organ into a small number of voxels and to estimate the conductivity as constant on each of these subvolumes. We use a 3D forward model based on the finite element method for studying the sensitivity of a simulated segmented prostate for three different electrode array designs. The three designs present different electrode areas and inter-electrode gaps. Larger electrodes are desirable as they present a better contact, but we show that as they result in smaller inter-electrode gaps, shunting currents can be significant and the sensitivity is reduced. Because our clinical measurement system employs a single current source, we consider tetrapolar measurement patterns for evaluating these electrode configurations. Optimal measurement patterns are well defined for adaptive systems, where multiple currents are injected at the same time. For the electrode array designs we consider, which are three dimensional, there are no established systematic methods for forming sets of linearly independent tetrapolar measurement patterns. We develop a novel method for automatically computing a full set of independent tetrapolar measurement patterns that maximizes the sensitivity in a region of interest (ROI). We use these patterns in the forward modeling and sensitivity studies. In addition to the electrode arrays on the probe, we study the use of a further configuration, where a distal electrode is positioned on the exterior of the body and used for current injection.  7. Conclusions Establishing how electrodes are configured for the US EIT transrectal probe described here is critical to optimizing EIT sensitivity. We elected to employ a rectangular array of 30 electrodes, co-aligned with the acoustic window of the transrectal US probe, in order to provide (1) sufficient area for tissue electrode interface, (2) a number of electrodes within the capabilities of typical EIT systems and (3) the ability to utilize coregistered US images for enhancing EIT image reconstruction. The electrodes were configured to extend 6 cm along the length of the US probe and to wrap 180° around the shaft. We also consider the presence of an additional distal electrode placed externally to the body of the patient. As these electrode configurations are three dimensional in space and relatively complex, the selection of appropriate measurement patterns is critical. We developed a novel and general method for automatically computing a full set of linearly independent tetrapolar measurement patterns. This method maximizes the sensitivity in an ROI of choice and can be useful in other applications of EIT, particularly in 3D (i.e., brain imaging, breast imaging), where, to our knowledge, no other systematic method has been established for selecting appropriate tetrapolar measurements. This method can also be extended to other forms of tomography, for example, to capacitive sensing and to microwave sensing. The test for linear independence of measurement patterns extends to these applications by extension of the impedance matrix concept. The ranking of measurement quadruplets can be extended as the sensitivity in these methods is expressed by a volume integral of cross products of an applied and a sensing field, similarly to EIT. Having developed an algorithm for forming appropriate measurement patterns, we study the sensitivity of the resulting measurements to changes in the prostate conductivity values. One of the main difficulties in sensing electrical properties of tissues from the inside is the rapid decay of sensitivity with increasing distances from the sensing probe. In order to partially overcome this difficulty, we propose to use prior information from US imaging into EIT reconstruction/parameter estimation. Specifically we intend to delineate the boundaries of the prostate from the US, to subdivide the volume into a small number of voxels and to estimate the conductivity as constant on each of these subvolumes. In the simulations we subdivided the prostate into 12 voxels and studied the sensitivity to conductivity changes in such regions. Measurement patterns were computed for optimizing the sensitivity in the distal region of the prostate, where the lowest sensitivity is expected. The sensitivity was studied for three different array designs, presenting different areas and different inter-electrode gaps. For all the three designs the average sensitivity in the 12 voxels results in voltage variations that are detectable by common laboratory EIT instrumentation. We show however that the design with larger electrodes results in a significantly decreased sensitivity, due to large shunting effects arising from smaller inter-electrode gaps. In terms of tradeoff between electrode area and sensitivity array 2 results to be a better choice, as it presents an only slightly decreased sensitivity with respect to array 1 but a larger area. The use of a distal electrode, external to the body of the patient, for injecting currents and thus improving the sensitivity was studied, and this configuration is shown to present few measurements with a significantly larger sensitivity. The use of a distal electrode has the potential to improve the detection capabilities of the proposed imaging configuration, though the clinical effectiveness needs to be studied, as the current paths between the distal electrode and the probe are not captured by the FEM mesh. Sensing only between electrodes on the probe and never between the distal electrode and the array on the probe might limit the effect of these modeling errors, as the resulting lead fields (and thus sensitivity) are strong only in the very proximity of the probe array. This approach, which limits the effects of modeling errors, might allow the reconstruction scheme to benefit from the use of this additional electrode. On the basis of the present analysis, we have developed an understanding of the effect of different electrode designs in terms of sensitivity. We believe that the proposed combined US EIT imaging approach can lead to a robust estimation of electrical properties of the prostate, and that it can be useful in the clinical application. We will conduct further numerical simulations using anatomical finite element meshes of the full abdomen, deriving from MRI images, for studying the use of the distal electrode and the errors arising from mesh truncation in more detail.
