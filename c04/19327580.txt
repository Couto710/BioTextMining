Dyskeratosis Congenita Synopsis Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized clinically by the triad of abnormal nails, reticular skin pigmentation, and oral leukoplakia, and associated with very high risks of developing aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, leukemia, and solid tumors. Patients have very short germline telomeres, and approximately half have mutations in one of six genes encoding proteins that maintain telomere function. Accurate diagnosis of DC is critical to ensure proper clinical management because patients with DC and bone marrow failure do not respond to immunosuppressive therapy and may have increased morbidity and mortality associated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  Summary The identification of large numbers of patients with DC has led to the recognition of a broad clinical phenotype, and the appreciation that these patients have abnormalities in telomere biology. DC is a multi-system disorder which includes a very high risk of BMF and cancer. Patients should be monitored closely for these and other complications. Mutations in six telomere biology genes have been identified in DC, representing about half of the known patients. Measurement of telomere length in leukocyte subsets determined by flow-FISH is a sensitive and specific screening test for DC in patients with BMF and normal chromosome breakage tests. If telomeres are less than the 1st percentile for age, we suggest prospective management and screening for DC-related complications as well as genetic testing for mutations in DC genes. Such studies are required to better understand the clinical consequences of DC, identify the basis for BMF response to androgens, define the best HSCT regimen, and determine the best measures for surveillance and prevention of cancer and other complications.

RS and HH indicate findings specific for Revesz Syndrome and Hoyeraal Hreidarsson Syndrome, respectively. System Findings Dermatologic Lacy, reticular pigmentation , primarily of the neck and chest; may be subtle or diffuse hyper- or hypopigmentation Abnormal fingernails and toenails , may be subtle with ridging, flaking, or poor growth, or more diffuse with nearly complete loss of nails Early gray hair or hair loss Hyperhidrosis Short stature Growth and Development Intrauterine growth retardation Developmental delay Epiphora due to stenosis of the lacrimal drainage system Ophthalmic Blepharitis Sparse eyelashes, ectropion, entropion, trichiasis Exudative retinopathy (RS) Dental caries, may be less frequent now due to improved dental hygiene Dental Periodontal disease Decreased root/crown ratio Taurodontism (enlarged pulp chambers of the teeth) Oral leukoplakia Ears, Nose, Throat Deafness (rare) Squamous cell head and neck cancer Cardiovascular Rare reported defects include atrial or ventricular septal defects, fibrosis, and dilatated cardiomyopathy Respiratory Pulmonary fibrosis Esophageal stenosis Gastrointestinal Enteropathy Liver fibrosis Genitourinary Urethral stenosis in males Epithelial cancers Musculoskeletal Osteoporosis Avascular necrosis of the hips and shoulders Neurologic Developmental delay Microcephaly Cerebellar hypoplasia (HH) Intracranial calcifications (RS) Psychiatric Schizophrenia (2 case reports) Endocrine Hypogonadism Bone marrow failure: a common presenting sign Hematologic Myelodysplastic syndrome Leukemia Immunologic Immunodeficiency Table 2 Dyskeratosis Congenita Genes The genes proven to be mutated in DC and their frequency estimates are shown. Depending on the study, approximately 40 to 50% of patients remained molecularly uncharacterized.
