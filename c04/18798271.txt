IJC-08-1118 REVISED July 16, 2008 Estrogen alpha and progesterone receptor expression in the normal mammary epithelium in relation to breast cancer risk Estrogens are central in the etiology of breast cancer and results from observational studies and randomized trials have also implicated progestins. The effects of these hormones in the mammary tissue are exerted through binding with specific receptor proteins in the cell nucleus. It has been proposed that higher estrogen receptor alpha expression in the normal breast epithelium may increase breast cancer risk. In a study in Greece, we determined estrogen alpha and progesterone receptor expression in normal mammary tissue adjacent to the pathological tissue from 267 breast cancer patients and 299 women with benign breast disease. Mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for estrogen receptor alpha and progesterone receptor, were applied. The H –index which incorporates frequency and intensity of staining of the cells and can range from 0 to 300 was deemed positive when it exceeded 9. Among premenopausal women, there was no evidence for an association with breast cancer risk for expression of either type of receptors. Among postmenopausal women, breast cancer risk was inversely associated with expression of both estrogen alpha (odds ratio = 0.39; p = 0.015) and progesterone (odds ratio = 0.40; p = 0.008) receptors. The hypothesis that over-expression of estrogen receptors alpha or progesterone receptors in normal breast epithelium may increase the risk of breast cancer was not supported by our data. Instead, we found evidence that over-expression of these receptors may be associated with reduced risk for breast cancer in line with the well known association of expression of these receptors in the malignant tissue and better breast cancer prognosis.  Introduction There is consensus that estrogens are central in the etiology of breast cancer and results from both observational studies and randomized trials have also implicated progestins ( 1 – 3 ). The effects of estrogens and progesterone in the mammary tissue are exerted through binding with specific receptor proteins in the cell nucleus ( 4 , 5 ). Khan and colleagues have suggested that higher estrogen receptor alpha expression in the normal breast epithelium may increase breast cancer risk ( 6 ). They undertook a study to evaluate this hypothesis by examining expression of estrogen receptors (at that time only estrogen receptors alpha were routinely evaluated) in the apparently normal mammary gland tissue adjacent to the pathological tissue in 174 women with breast cancer and 202 women with benign breast diseases ( 7 ). The results were interpreted as indicating that over-expression of estrogen receptors alpha in normal breast epithelium may augment estrogen sensitivity and, hence, the risk of breast cancer. In an editorial accompanying this study, the authors found the results intriguing, but also pointed out some limitations of the study and the need for additional investigations ( 8 ). Since then, the results of two partially overlapping ecological studies in Asia ( 9 , 10 ) were interpreted as compatible with those of the analytical investigation previously undertaken by Khan and colleagues ( 7 ). No study based on individuals however, using an approach similar to that of Khan and colleagues ( 7 ), has been reported, possibly because such an investigation presents considerable practical difficulties. We have undertaken such a study in Greece also examining progesterone receptors, given the long known positive correlation of the expression of these two types of receptors in malignant breast tissue ( 11 ).  Materials and Methods From March 2001 till May 2005, women who have undergone mammary biopsy in two major breast clinics in Athens, Greece were asked to participate in the study. Those who agreed to join the study provided informed consent for an in person interview, review of their medical records and use for research purposes of biological specimens collected in the context of their standard medical care. The study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the University of Athens. In breast clinic 1, women who underwent a breast biopsy during the duration of the study and women who had undergone a biopsy prior to the study initiation (but were interviewed during the indicated study period) were included. All women in breast clinic 2 underwent biopsy during the study period. Among eligible women in both clinics, we estimate that about 75% agreed to participate in the study. In several instances, women refused to allow any recording of information concerning agreement to participate in the study; thus, the refusal proportion cannot be accurately calculated. All women completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire with information on sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, as well as on gynaecological and general medical history. We were able to determine receptors in normal mammary tissue in 267 women with breast cancer and 299 women with benign breast disease (BBD). In breast clinic 1, histological samples were made available in the form of paraffin embedded tissue (PET) blocks, whereas in breast clinic 2, samples obtained during biopsy were frozen in liquid nitrogen before being fixed in 10% neutral buffer formalin at 25°C for 24 hours and processed to PETs. In all instances samples from surgical biopsies were examined. The streptavidine-biotin-superoxidase method ( 12 , 13 ) was applied on paraffin sections. The sections that were prepared from fresh frozen tissue were fixed in a 10% formol solution of pH 7.4, at 25°C for 24 hours, in the automatic immunochemical BioGenex i6000 Consolidated Staining System. The primary specific mouse monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Novocastra Laboratories Ltd, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. Clone 6F11, specific for estrogen receptor alpha, was applied in a 1:60 dilution, and clone 1A6, specific for the progesterone receptor, was applied in a 1:40 dilution. The immunocytochemical results were scored in a semiquantitative way using the “H-score”, which incorporates both the number of cells with positive staining and the intensity of staining ( 12 , 14 ). Intensity of staining was evaluated on the basis of percentages of stained cells under four categories, denoted as 0 (no staining), 1 (weak but detectably above control), 2 (distinct) and 3 (strong). The H-score was calculated from the formula [(a0*0) + (a1*1) + (a2*2) + (a3*3)]*100, in which a0 = percent (expressed as a fraction of 1) of cells with intensity of staining 0, a1 = percent of cells with intensity staining 1, a2 = percent of cells with intensity of staining 2 and a3 = percent of cells with intensity of staining 3. The H-score, therefore, ranges from 0 to 300. We have considered scores from 0 to 9 (inclusive) as indicative of estrogen alpha (or progesterone) negative tissues and scores from 10 or more as indicative of estrogen alpha (or progesterone) positive tissues. Multiple logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) contrasting breast cancer to BBD on the basis of expression of estrogen alpha or progesterone receptors in the corresponding normal mammary tissue. In all analyses, data were stratified by clinic and adjusted for age, age at menarche and body mass index (BMI) (continuously), as well as for menopausal status (pre- and peri- menopausal women versus postmenopausal), parity (parous versus nulliparous) and family history of breast cancer in first degree relatives (yes versus no). The above indicated cuttoff point of the H-score was used, although, in secondary analyses, additional cutoff points and trend tests were utilized. The p value was set at 0.05. Analyses were conducted with the SPSS 16.0 statistical package.  Results Table 1 shows the distribution of women with benign breast disease or breast cancer by descriptive characteristics, source of tissue samples and expression of estrogen alpha and progesterone receptors in the normal mammary tissue adjacent to the pathological tissue. Because both clinics are involved in mammographic screening, participating women with breast cancer are somewhat younger than women with breast cancer in general. As expected, women with BBD are younger than breast cancer patients. All variables indicated in Table 1 have been adjusted for in the analyses, whereas the data were stratified by source of tissue samples. Table 2 presents the odds for breast cancer versus BBD by, alternatively, expression of estrogen alpha or progesterone receptors in the normal mammary tissue adjacent to the pathological tissue, overall and by menopausal status. Overall, there were suggestive inverse associations between expression of estrogen alpha and progesterone receptors and breast cancer risk which, however, were not statistically significant. For estrogen receptors alpha the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were 0.68 and 0.45 to 1.03, whereas for progesterone receptors the corresponding figures were 0.69 and 0.45 to 1.05. Among premenopausal women associations were essentially null with respect to both estrogen receptors alpha and progesterone receptors. In contrast, among postmenopausal women, expression of both estrogen receptors alpha and progesterone receptors in the normal mammary tissue was strongly and statistically significantly inversely associated with breast cancer risk. The odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals were 0.39 and 0.18 to 0.84 for expression of estrogen receptors alpha and 0.40 and 0.20 to 0.79 for expression of progesterone receptors. Tests for interaction by menopausal status generated p values 0.085 for estrogen alpha and 0.046 for progesterone receptors. Though we opted for a cut-off point frequently used in clinical practice, we have also repeated the analyses using different cutoff points for receptor expression, as well as trend tests, using as exposure the H score in successive categories. The results were consistent with those presented in Table 2 in documenting an inverse association of expression of estrogen alpha and progesterone receptors with breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women, whereas no clear pattern was evident among premenopausal women. In additional analyses, we have estimated the odds ratio for breast cancer versus BBD contrasting women expressing both receptors in their normal mammary tissue, to women expressing neither (and ignoring women discordant with respect to expression of the two studied receptors). Over all women, the odds ratio was 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.39 to 1.04, p = 0.069), whereas among pre- and perimenopausal women it was 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.53 to 2.00, p = 0.914) and among postmenopausal women it was 0.31 (95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.73, p = 0.008). P value for interaction by menopausal status was 0.045.

P value for interaction by menopausal status was 0.045.  Discussion There have been two fairly large case-control studies examining the expression of estrogen receptors alpha in the normal mammary tissue in relation to breast cancer risk: the study by Khan and colleagues ( 7 ) and the present investigation. An earlier study by Khan and colleagues ( 6 ) was based on data included in their later report ( 7 ). The study by Khan and colleagues ( 7 ) and the present investigation point to opposite directions. Khan and colleagues reported a non-significant positive association among premenopausal women (p for trend = 0.384) and a significant positive association among postmenopausal women (p for trend = 0.032). Specifically, in comparison to women with the lowest level of estrogen receptor expression, those with the highest level of estrogen receptor expression had an age-adjusted odds ratio of 1.6 (95% CI 0.7 to 3.5) among premenopausal women and 3.1 (95% CI 1.3 to 7.6) among postmenopausal women. Further adjustment for breast cancer risk factors tended to accentuate the associations, but with much larger confidence intervals ( 7 ). We have found a non-significant inverse association of estrogen receptor alpha expression with breast cancer risk among premenopausal women and a significant inverse association among postmenopausal women. Moreover, among postmenopausal women, we found a significant inverse association of breast cancer risk with expression of progesterone receptors in the normal mammary epithelium. The reason for the discrepant results is not apparent, but the biologically plausible hypothesis advanced by Khan and colleagues ( 6 ) is not supported by our data. Instead our findings indicate that over-expression of estrogen alpha and progesterone receptors may be associated with reduced risk for breast cancer, in line with the well known association of expression of these receptors in the malignant tissue and better breast cancer prognosis ( 15 ). Strengths of this investigation are the larger sample size compared to previous investigations ( 6 , 7 ), the comprehensive assessment of covariates and the consistency of the findings, irrespectively of the cutoff points used for the assessment of receptor expression. A limitation of the study is the unavoidable selection of study participants, who were volunteers from two clinics. Factors affecting selection, however, are unlikely to be correlated with receptor expression and, thus, generate selection bias. Another limitation is the use of BBD patients as a control group. It is imposed by ethical considerations, but it introduces complexity in the interpretation of the results of our study, as well as those of any relevant study. Investigation of an association between expression of estrogen receptors alpha and/or progesterone receptors in the normal mammary tissue with breast cancer risk could be of importance and deserves further investigation. If an association, positive or inverse, were conclusively documented from additional studies and were inferred as causal, it could provide a critical insight into the pathogenesis of breast cancer and, conceivably, a window of opportunity for possible breast cancer prevention. Modulators of the expression of estrogen alpha and progesterone receptors in the normal mammary gland have not been identified, mostly because little research has been done on this subject. Such modulators, however, are likely to exist given the apparently large variability of receptor expression among women.
