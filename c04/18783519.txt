Helicobacter and Gastric Malignancies Individuals infected with Helicobacter pylori , a stomach colonizing bacteria, have an increased risk of developing gastric malignancies. The risk for developing cancer relates to the physiologic and histologic changes that H. pylori infection induces in the stomach. In the last year numerous studies have been conducted in order to characterize the association between H. pylori infection and gastric cancer. These studies range from epidemiologic approaches aiming at the identification of environmental, host genetic, and bacterial factors associated with risk of gastric cancer, to molecular and cell biology approaches aiming at understanding the interaction between H. pylori and the transforming epithelial cell. In this review an account of the last yearâ€™s research activity on the relationship between H. pylori and gastric cancer will be given.
