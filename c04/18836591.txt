Disrupting the Rb-Raf-1 Interaction: A potential therapeutic target for cancer Summary Cell cycle progression in cancer is often mediated by disrupting the function of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, Rb. One way in which Rbâ€™s function is altered is through phosphorylation mediated by cyclin dependent kinases ( 1 ). Our studies had shown that the Raf-1 kinase binds and phosphorylates Rb very early in the cell cycle prior to the binding of cyclins and cdks ( 2 ). It was also found that human lung cancer tumor samples had increased binding of Raf-1 to Rb, suggesting this interaction could have contributed to the malignancy of these tumors ( 3 ). Disrupting the Rb-Raf-1 interaction could inhibit cell proliferation in a multitude of cancer cell lines as well as prevent angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo . Thus, the Rb-Raf-1 interaction is a promising therapeutic target for cancer. This review will highlight the importance of the Rb-Raf-1 interaction in cancer, the search for small molecules capable of disrupting the interaction as well as properties of Rb-Raf-1 disruptors, focusing specifically on RRD-251(Rb-Raf-1 Disruptor 251). This review will also touch on why targeting protein-protein interactions may be a viable alternate better strategy to inhibiting kinase function for cancer therapies.
