TDP-43 in Neurodegenerative Disorders Background: The number of neurodegenerative diseases associated with pathological aggregates of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) has increased, leading to the new designation “TDP-43 proteinopathy.” Biochemically, TDP-43 proteinopathies are characterized by decreased solubility, hyperphosphorylation, and cleavage of TDP-43 into 25- and 35-kD fragments, as well as altered cellular localization. Objective: This review summarizes the extensive research characterizing the distribution of TDP-43 pathology in human postmortem brain tissue and discusses possible therapeutic strategies based on genetic and in vitro studies. Methods: We reviewed recently published studies of TDP-43 proteinopathy in the following manuscript. Results/conclusion: Given that several different genetic mutations can lead to TDP-43 proteinopathies, including mutations in progranulin and valosin-containing protein, research is needed to decipher and potentially exploit the link between these mutations and TDP-43 pathology.
