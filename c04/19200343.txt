Triterpenoid CDDO–methylamide improves memory and decreases amyloid plaques in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease Oxidative stress is one of the earliest events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and can markedly exacerbate amyloid pathology. Modulation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways represents an important approach for AD therapy. Synthetic triterpenoids have been found to facilitate antioxidant response and reduce inflammation in several models. We investigated the effect of the triterpenoid, 2-Cyano-3,12-Dioxooleana-1,9-Dien-28-Oic acid-MethylAmide (CDDO-MA) in Tg19959 mice, which carry the human amyloid precursor protein with two mutations. These mice develop memory impairments and amyloid plaques as early as 2–3 months of age. CDDO-MA was provided with chow (800 mg/kg) from 1 to 4 months of age. CDDO-MA significantly improved spatial memory retention and reduced plaque burden, A?42 levels, microgliosis, and oxidative stress in Tg19959 mice.  Materials and methods Animals and treatment Tg19959 mice were obtained from Dr. George Carlson (McLaughlin Research Institute, Great Falls, MT, USA). They were originally produced by pronuclear injection of FVB × 129S6F1 embryos with a cosmid insert containing APP695 with two familial AD mutations (KM670/671NL and V717F), under the control of the hamster PrP promoter. Mice were backcrossed into and maintained on a hybrid B6/SJL background by crossing APP mutant males to B6/SJL females from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Offsprings were genotyped by PCR of tail DNA. Mutant APP-positive mice were randomly assigned to receive either control chow (LabDiet 5002, Purina-Mills, Richmond, IN, USA) or chow containing TP (800 mg of CDDO-MA/kg of chow). The chow was pelleted by Purina-Mills. CDDO-MA was synthesized as previously described ( Honda et al. 2002 ). Tg19959 mice were fed with CDDO-MA or control chow beginning at 1 month of age for 3 months. Behavioral analyses were performed at 4 months of age, and brain histopathology and biochemistry were then assessed on the same animals. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Behavioral studies Exploration and locomotor activity were evaluated in an open-field made of opaque black plastic (45 cm × 45 cm; height: 20 cm). At the beginning of the test, each mouse was placed in one of the corners. The total distance traveled was recorded during 5 min per day and averaged over 3 days using a video tracking system (Ethovision 3.0; Noldus Technology, Attleborough, MA, USA). Exploration and anxiety were measured in an elevated plus maze. The apparatus, made of opaque beige plastic, consisted of four arms (length: 30 cm; width: 5 cm; height: 39 cm) in a cross-shaped form and a central region (5 cm × 5 cm). Two of these arms were enclosed on three sides by walls (height: 15 cm) whereas the other arms were not. The two enclosed arms faced each other as did the two open arms. At the beginning of the test, mice were placed in the central region. Time spent in the open arms was measured during a single trial of 5 min. Spatial learning and memory were assessed in the Morris water maze. An opaque basin (diameter: 84 cm; height of the wall: 51 cm) was filled with water (23°C). The water was opacified with non-toxic and odor-free white tempera paint. In order to familiarize the animals with the task, each mouse was placed on the hidden platform (diameter: 10 cm) in the center of the basin for 20 s. Then, four consecutive practice trials were performed, where the animals were released 3–5 cm away from the platform and were allowed to find it within 20 s. For each trial, mice were forced to stay 20 s on the platform before being removed by the experimenter. This procedure was repeated the next day. During the acquisition period, extra-maze visual cues such as light fixtures and wall posters were arranged in the room. The hidden platform was located in the middle of the northwest (NW) quadrant, 1 cm beneath water level. Each day, mice were placed next to and facing the wall of the basin in four different starting positions: north (N), east (E), south (S), and west (W), corresponding to four successive trials. Latencies and total distances before reaching the platform were recorded for 5 days with a video tracking system (Ethovision). After each trial, animals were placed in a plastic holding cage filled with paper towels to keep them dry and warm, with an inter-trial interval of 20 min. Whenever the mouse failed to reach the platform within the maximally allowed time of 60 s, it was placed on the platform by the experimenter for 5 s. A probe trial was assessed 24 h after the acquisition period, removing the platform from the pool. The mice were released on the north side for a single trial of 60 s, during which the percentage of time spent in each quadrant was measured for the first 15 s. To ensure that any differences were not due to visual deficits, the visible platform version of the water maze was performed. In this cued version, a pole (13 cm) was added on the platform. Animals were tested during four trials where the platform was located in the southeast (SE) quadrant. The duration of a single trial was 60 s with an inter-trial interval of 20 min. Latencies and total distances before reaching the platform were recorded and averaged over the four trials. Motor coordination was evaluated in an accelerated rotorod (Economex, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA). The beam of the apparatus (diameter 4 cm, width 8 cm, height 38 cm) was made of ribbed plastic, and plates were flanked on either side to prevent any escape. Mice were placed on the top of the revolving beam for four successive trials per day, with 20 min inter-trial intervals. The rod accelerated gradually from 4 to 40 rpm over 2 min. Latencies before falling from the rod were recorded over 2 days and averaged. Tissue harvest and preparation After anesthesia by i.p. injection of sodium pentobarbital, mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.9% sodium chloride. Brains were removed and dissected on ice. The entire right hemibrain was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for measurement of CDDO-MA levels. The left hemibrain was sectioned coronally. Frontal sections were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at ?80°C for biochemical assays. Parietal sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 for 24 h and stored in cryoprotectant solution (30% glycerol, 30% ethylene glycol in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) until further processing for histochemical studies. Brain levels of CDDO-MA Cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid methylamide levels were measured by mass spectrometry. For extraction, 0.5 mL acetonitrile was added to 100–150 mg of tissue before homogenization on ice using a Tissue-Tearor (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Samples were then centrifuged at 20 000 g for 10 min. The acetonitrile extracts were diluted 1 : 1 with 20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 20 000 g for 5 min. The supernatants (100 ?L injection volume) were loaded onto a Waters 2695 HPLC (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) and analyzed by reverse phase chromatography on a Waters XTerra MS C18 5 ?m particle column using an 8 min gradient from 46% to 94% acetonitrile. CDDO-MA and its metabolites were detected using a single quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization (Waters Micromass ZQ). Analysis was carried out using Waters MassLynx 4.1 software. Standard curves were generated by spiking control tissue extracts with at least six different concentrations of CDDO-MA. All calculated values were within the limits of the spiked standards. Immunohistochemistry and quantitation Regions analyzed included the retrosplenial/motor cortex and CA1/dentate region of the hippocampus. The retrosplenial/motor cortex was analyzed in five sections (350 ?m apart) per mouse beginning at the level of bregma ?1.06 to bregma ?1.94. The CA1/dentate region was analyzed in five sections (350 ?m apart) per mouse beginning at the level of bregma ?1.34 to bregma ?2.7. Sections were pre-treated with 50% formic acid for 5 min before labeling with anti-A?42 rabbit polyclonal antibody, AB5078P (1 : 1000, Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). Immunostaining with AB5078P was similar to that seen with the mouse monoclonal anti-A? antibody 6E10 (1 : 1000, Covance, Emerville, CA, USA) ( Fig. S3 ). However, 6E10 also binds APP and ?-C-terminal fragments in addition to A?, and not surprisingly produced more background staining. Because A?42 is considered to be the pathogenic species of interest, quantitation was performed with AB5078P. Sections were also labeled with anti-CD-40 rat monoclonal antibody against activated microglia (1 : 100, Serotec, Raleigh, NC, USA). Double staining for activated microglia and plaques was carried out using CD-40 and Congo Red. Double staining for microglial phagocytic activity and plaques was carried out using anti-CD-68 mouse monoclonal antibody ED-1 (1 : 500, Serotec, Oxford, UK) and Congo Red. Immunolabeling was detected by the avidin–biotin complex peroxidase method and visualized with diaminobenzidine incubation for 5 min (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Sections were viewed with the 10× objective on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA), and digital images were captured using Stereo Investigator 4.35 (Microbrightfield, Burlington, VT, USA). Quantitative analysis was performed using NIH Image 1.63 (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). For A?42 deposits, the percent area occupied by plaques and the plaque count (number per 0.75 mm2) were calculated. For CD40 immunoreactivity, the percent area occupied by microglial cells was measured. ELISA for levels of A?42 and A?40 A?42 and A?40 levels were analyzed from brain tissues previously homogenized in 6% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). A?42 and A?40 ELISAs were performed using commercial kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Western blotting Snap-frozen brain sections were homogenized by sonication in 6% SDS containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) added fresh. Protein concentration was measured (DC Protein Measurement Kit, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Homogenates were electrophoresed through 4–12% Tri-Bis NuPage or 10–20% Tris–Tricine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride, membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk/phosphate buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and exposed overnight to primary antibody at 4 °C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody binding was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. ?-Tubulin was used as a loading control. Primary antibodies and concentrations were rabbit polyclonal anti-heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) SPA-895 (1 : 500, Stressgen, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); goat polyclonal anti-NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (1 : 1000, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA); sheep polyclonal anti-Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (1 : 1000, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA); rabbit polyclonal anti-catalase (1 : 1000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA); rabbit polyclonal anti-glutathione reductase (1 : 500, Abcam); rabbit polyclonal anti-glutathione peroxidase 1 (1 : 500, Abcam); rabbit polyclonal anti-APP 369 (1 : 1000, gift from S. Gandy, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA); mouse monoclonal anti-A? 6E10 (1 : 1000, Covance); rabbit polyclonal anti-insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) (1 : 500, Calbiochem); rabbit polyclonal anti-neprilysin CD10 (1 : 500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA); mouse monoclonal anti-?-tubulin (1 : 10000, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Films were scanned at 600 dpi, and densitometry was quantified with Scion Image 4.0.2 (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD, USA). Ratios were calculated using densitometric values for the protein of interest divided by densitometric values for ?-tubulin. Measurement of oxidized proteins Brain sections were lysed in 6% SDS containing protease inhibitor, and protein concentrations were determined (DC Protein Measurement Kit, Bio-Rad Laboratories). Protein carbonyl levels were measured using the Oxyblot Protein Oxidation Detection Kit (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with the following modifications: 5% non-fat dry milk/PBST was used as blocking solution and antibody diluent; the membrane was blocked for 1 h; and the primary antibody incubation was overnight. A 20-?g aliquot of protein was analyzed in each lane. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Films were scanned at 600 dpi, and Scion Image 4.0.2 (Scion Corp.) was used for densitometry. Quantification was expressed as the ratio of carbonyls to tubulin. Membranes were stained with 0.1% Ponceau S solution to verify equal amount of proteins. To determine the direct effect of CDDO-MA on protein oxidation in vitro , bovine serum albumin (BSA, 200 ?g) was oxidized by incubation for 2.5 h at 37°C in 50 ?L of 10% dimethylsulfoxide, 100 lM FeCl3, 25 mM ascorbate, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), with 0, 20, 40, or 100 nM CDDO-MA. Five ?L of each of these reaction mixtures (20 ?g BSA) was then subjected to protein carbonyl measurement as described above. Analysis of A? oligomers For immunohistochemistry, sections were treated with 90% formic acid for 5 min prior to labeling with anti-oligomer antibody A11 (1 : 500; Invitrogen) ( Kayed et al. 2003 ). Immunolabeling was detected by the avidin–biotin complex peroxidase method and visualized with diaminobenzidine incubation for 5 min (Vector Laboratories). Quantitative analysis of the percent area occupied by A11-immunoreactivity and the A11-immunoreactive patch count (number per 0.75 mm2) was carried out as previously described for A? immunohistochemistry and quantitation. For western blot, 30 ?g of protein from 6% SDS brain extracts were loaded into 10–20% Tris–Tricine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Synthetic A?42 oligomers prepared as previously described ( Barghorn et al. 2005 ) were used as positive control. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride, membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk/PBST and exposed overnight at 4°C to the primary antibody 6E10 (1 : 1000). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody binding was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. a-Tubulin (1 : 10000, Sigma) was used as a loading control for the western blots. Films were scanned at 600 dpi and densitometry was performed with Scion Image 4.0.2 (Scion Corp.). Statistical analysis anova was used to compare three groups: Tg19959 fed with CDDO-MA, Tg19959 fed with control chow, and wild-type mice fed with control chow. Post hoc Student–Neuman–Keuls (SNK) tests were used for further analyses between groups. When only two groups were involved, two-tailed t -tests were used to compare CDDO-MA-fed and control-fed Tg19959 mice (Statview 5.0.1, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

Results Detection of CDDO-MA in mouse brains Detection of CDDO-MA in mouse brains was performed by mass spectrometry. Figure S1a shows chromatograms of CDDO-MA spiked in mouse brain homogenates at different concentrations, used to form a standard curve. In our experiment, CDDO-MA provided via chow was present in brains of treated Tg19959 mice at 39 ± 11 nmol/kg. Thus, CDDO-MA crossed the blood brain barrier. Potencies of CDDO-MA in cultured cells were previously reported by Dinkova-Kostova et al. 2005 . CDDO-MA (called TP224 in their paper) acted at nanomolar concentrations to double the activity of NQO1 and to inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by 50% ( Dinkova-Kostova et al. 2005 ). To ensure that CDDO-MA diet did not change food intake, body weights were recorded. No significant differences were found between Tg19959 mice fed CDDO-MA chow and Tg19959 mice fed control chow ( Fig. S1b and c ). CDDO-MA improved spatial memory retention in Tg19959 mice Mice were given 5 days of training to locate the position of a hidden platform in the Morris water maze. Latency and total distance before reaching the platform were recorded each day ( Fig. S2 ). During this acquisition period, Tg19959 mice fed control chow were impaired compared with wild-type littermates. Tg19959 mice fed with control chow had longer latencies and distances (SNK, p < 0.05) than wild-type mice fed with control chow. Three month administration of CDDO-MA did not affect performance of the transgenic mice during the acquisition phase. Spatial memory was assessed by a probe trial where the platform was removed from the maze and percent time spent in each quadrant was analyzed for the first 15 s of the trial ( Fig. 1b ). Because mice were released at the northern pole (N), the key distinction indicating memory of the platform was whether they turned left toward the NW (target) quadrant or right toward the NE quadrant ( Fig. 1a ). Preference for the target quadrant was therefore measured by examining the percent time spent in the NW quadrant ( Fig. 1c ) and the difference ( d = NW% ? NE%) in percent time spent in the NW versus the NE quadrants ( Fig. 1d ). Tg19959 mice fed control chow had memory impairment, compared with wild-type mice fed control chow, as shown by the percent time spent in the NW quadrant ( Fig. 1c ; SNK, p < 0.05) and the difference d ( Fig. 1d ; SNK, p < 0.05). In contrast, Tg19959 mice fed CDDO-MA significantly preferred the NW quadrant, compared with control fed Tg19959 mice, as shown by the percent time spent in the NW quadrant ( Fig. 1c ; SNK, p < 0.05) and the difference d ( Fig. 1d ; SNK, p < 0.05). Thus, CDDO-MA administration for 3 months improved spatial memory retention during the probe trial. During the visible platform task ( Table S1a ), there were no significant differences in latency or distance traveled between groups. No impairments in swim speed were found during the probe trial ( Table S1b ). Locomotor activity, exploration, and motor coordination were also analyzed ( Table S2 ). Compared with wild-type, Tg19959 mice exhibited increased distance traveled in the open field (SNK, p < 0.05). CDDO-MA did not alter the motor behavior of Tg19959 mice. CDDO-MA reduced plaque burden and microglia in the hippocampus of Tg19959 mice In Tg19959 brains, plaque burden was analyzed after staining with A?42 antibody AB5078P ( Fig. S3 ). CDDO-MA reduced significantly hippocampal amyloid deposits ( Fig. 2a ) in Tg19959 mice, measured by plaque count ( Fig. 2b ; t -test p = 0.0211) and percent area occupied by plaque ( Fig. 2c ; t -test p = 0.0072). In cortex, CDDO-MA did not significantly reduce number of plaques ( t -test p = 0.9352), though there was a trend for CDDO-MA to reduce percent area occupied by plaque ( Fig. 2c ; t -test, p = 0.08). In addition, CDDO-MA significantly reduced inflammation in the hippocampus ( t -test, p = 0.0437) but not in the cortex ( t -test, p = 0.1236), measured by the percent area of microglial staining ( Fig. 2d and e ). To further analyze the relationship between microglia and plaques, we double-labeled sections of control fed and CDDO-MA fed mice with CD-40 antibody and Congo Red ( Fig. S4a ). With CDDO-MA, there was an overall reduction in staining for activated microglia but a local increase in staining in the immediate vicinity of plaques. We also assessed the phagocytic activity of microglia around plaques by double labeling with ED-1 antibody and Congo Red ( Fig. S4b ). With CDDO-MA, there was an increase in ED-1 staining in the immediate vicinity of plaques. CDDO-MA decreased levels of SDS-soluble A?42 but did not affect APP processing Levels of 6% SDS-soluble A?42 and A?40 were measured by ELISA ( Fig. 3 ). Tg19959 mice fed CDDO-MA had decreased levels of A?42 compared with Tg19959 mice fed control chow ( Fig. 3a ; t -test, p = 0.0453). A?40 levels were not significantly changed by CDDO-MA treatment in Tg19959 mice ( Fig. 3b ; t -test, p = 0.1480). Because A?42 was reduced, we assessed whether CDDO-MA affected APP processing or A? degrading enzymes. Brain levels of full length APP ( Fig. 3c ), ?-carboxyterminal fragments of APP (CTFs) ( Fig. 3d ), and ?-CTFs ( Fig. 3e ) in Tg19959 mice were not changed with CDDO-MA. In addition, levels of neprilysin ( Fig. 3f ) and IDE ( Fig. 3g ) were not changed with CDDO-MA. Effects of CDDO-MA on SDS-soluble A? oligomers in Tg19959 mice Immunolabeling of A? oligomers was performed by using antibody A11 ( Kayed et al. 2003 ). No significant differences were found between Tg19959 mice fed control versus CDDO-MA chow, as measured by density of A11 immunoreactive patches ( Fig. 4b ; t -test, p = 0.3372 for hippocampus, p = 0.6703 for cortex) and by percent area occupied by A11 immunoreactivity ( Fig. 4c ; t -test, p = 0.3265 for hippocampus, p = 0.5329 for cortex). Western blot with 6E10 antibody was also used to detect A? oligomers in Tg19959 mice. In 6% SDS extract, only trimers (~12 kDa) were identified and quantified. A 50-kD band consistent with dodecamers was also seen but was extremely faint even with prolonged exposure. No significant differences in trimers were found between Tg19959 mice fed CDDO-MA versus control chow ( Fig. 4d ; t -test, p = 0.6136). CDDO-MA decreased oxidative stress in Tg19959 mice Oxidative stress is an important component in AD pathogenesis. To analyze the effect of CDDO-MA on oxidative stress, we examined levels of protein carbonyls, a marker of protein oxidation ( Fig. 5a-c ). Compared with wild-type mice, Tg19959 mice fed control chow had increased protein carbonyl levels measured by western blots (SNK, p < 0.05). After 3 month of CDDO-MA treatment, levels of protein carbonyls were significantly reduced in Tg19959 mice compared with those fed control chow (SNK, p < 0.05). Because synthetic TPs have been shown to up-regulate endogenous antioxidant responses in vitro ( Liby et al. 2005 , 2007 ), we analyzed the effect of CDDO-MA on protein levels of several antioxidant enzymes – HO-1, NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase 1. Surprisingly, CDDO-MA administration did not affect levels of any of these enzymes (data not shown), except for HO-1 ( Fig. 5d ). CDDO-MA augmented the level of HO-1 in Tg19959 mice ( Fig. 5d ; SNK, p < 0.05). Considering that CDDO-MA reduced brain protein carbonyl levels apparently without up-regulating a coordinated antioxidant program, we determined whether CDDO-MA could have direct antioxidant effects. BSA was oxidized in vitro by exposure to iron/ascorbate in the presence of 0, 20, 40, and 100 nM CDDO-MA. Levels of protein carbonyls were then measured. CDDO-MA decreased protein carbonyl levels at 40 nM and more markedly at 100 nM ( Fig. 5e ). This finding suggests that CDDO-MA could directly act as an antioxidant in Tg19959 mice.  Results Detection of CDDO-MA in mouse brains Detection of CDDO-MA in mouse brains was performed by mass spectrometry. Figure S1a shows chromatograms of CDDO-MA spiked in mouse brain homogenates at different concentrations, used to form a standard curve. In our experiment, CDDO-MA provided via chow was present in brains of treated Tg19959 mice at 39 ± 11 nmol/kg. Thus, CDDO-MA crossed the blood brain barrier. Potencies of CDDO-MA in cultured cells were previously reported by Dinkova-Kostova et al. 2005 . CDDO-MA (called TP224 in their paper) acted at nanomolar concentrations to double the activity of NQO1 and to inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by 50% ( Dinkova-Kostova et al. 2005 ). To ensure that CDDO-MA diet did not change food intake, body weights were recorded. No significant differences were found between Tg19959 mice fed CDDO-MA chow and Tg19959 mice fed control chow ( Fig. S1b and c ).

Because synthetic TPs have been shown to up-regulate endogenous antioxidant responses in vitro ( Liby et al. 2005 , 2007 ), we analyzed the effect of CDDO-MA on protein levels of several antioxidant enzymes – HO-1, NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase 1. Surprisingly, CDDO-MA administration did not affect levels of any of these enzymes (data not shown), except for HO-1 ( Fig. 5d ). CDDO-MA augmented the level of HO-1 in Tg19959 mice ( Fig. 5d ; SNK, p < 0.05). Considering that CDDO-MA reduced brain protein carbonyl levels apparently without up-regulating a coordinated antioxidant program, we determined whether CDDO-MA could have direct antioxidant effects. BSA was oxidized in vitro by exposure to iron/ascorbate in the presence of 0, 20, 40, and 100 nM CDDO-MA. Levels of protein carbonyls were then measured. CDDO-MA decreased protein carbonyl levels at 40 nM and more markedly at 100 nM ( Fig. 5e ). This finding suggests that CDDO-MA could directly act as an antioxidant in Tg19959 mice.  CDDO-MA decreased oxidative stress in Tg19959 mice Oxidative stress is an important component in AD pathogenesis. To analyze the effect of CDDO-MA on oxidative stress, we examined levels of protein carbonyls, a marker of protein oxidation ( Fig. 5a-c ). Compared with wild-type mice, Tg19959 mice fed control chow had increased protein carbonyl levels measured by western blots (SNK, p < 0.05).

Discussion There is a large body of evidence demonstrating the involvement of oxidative stress in AD pathogenesis. Oxidative stress can exacerbate amyloid pathology ( Li et al. 2004 ; Liu et al. 2008 ) and accelerate the onset of behavioral abnormalities ( Esposito et al. 2006 ) in APP transgenic mice. Conversely, decreasing oxidative stress in APP transgenic mice through depletion of Nox2, the catalytic subunit of NAPDH oxidase, rescued behavioral and neurovascular function ( Park et al. 2005 , 2008 ). Inflammation by glial activation is also an important factor involved in AD pathogenesis. Microglia can play a role in the clearance of amyloid plaques by phagocytosis ( Jucker and Heppner 2008 ; Town et al. 2008 ), but can also be a source of ROS production through cytokine activation. Several therapeutic approaches have been taken to counteract cellular damage due to either oxidative stress or inflammation in AD models. Recently, synthetic TPs, derivatives of CDDO, have been found in vitro and in vivo to be potent inducers of cytoprotective genes that increase resistance to oxidative stress ( Kang et al. 2005 ; Lee et al. 2005 ; Liby et al. 2005 , 2007 ). In addition, TPs markedly inhibited inflammatory stress induced by inducible NOS and cyclooxygenase 2 ( Dinkova-Kostova et al. 2005 ). For these reasons, we examined whether the TP, CDDO-MA, could improve the AD-like phenotype of Tg19959 mice. We administered CDDO-MA to Tg19959 mice for 3 months and assessed its effects at 4 months of age. Compared with the decade-long course of human AD, this is a short-term study and focused early in disease pathogenesis. In our study, CDDO-MA given for 3 months improved significantly, retention in the probe trial, even though it did not change learning during the acquisition phase. In Tg2576 mice, pomegranate juice improved learning but not retention ( Hartman et al. 2006 ), thus also exhibiting differential effects but complementary to those of CDDO-MA. These and other studies ( Daumas et al. 2008 ) indicate that learning and memory are related but distinct processes, both of which are impaired in AD. Cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid methylamide given for 3 months also reduced amyloid plaques and SDS-soluble A?42 levels in Tg19959 mice. These effects were not due to a decrease in APP production and processing, as shown by the lack of change in APP and CTF levels. The A? degrading enzymes neprilysin and IDE were also unchanged. CDDO-MA did not affect levels of oligomers detected by A11 or 6E10 antibodies. It should be noted that the detection of A? oligomers is complex and highly dependent on technical factors including the antibodies used. The A11 antibody is commonly used to assay A? oligomers, though it also recognizes oligomers of other proteins ( Kayed et al. 2003 ; Yoshiike et al. 2008 ). We therefore complemented the A11 immunohistochemistry with western blotting using 6E10, which is specific for species containing the human A? sequence. Within the limitations of these techniques, the results were consistent, suggesting that 3-month administration of CDDO-MA did not affect oligomerization of A? in our model. Thus, the protective effects of CDDO-MA are likely to be exerted downstream of A? oligomers, perhaps reducing toxicity caused by inflammation or oxidative stress, or increasing phagocytosis of more aggregated species. Importantly, CDDO-MA did reduce overall microgliosis and oxidative stress in Tg19959 mice. A recent study of CDDO-methyl ester reported the same effects in vitro ( Tran et al. 2008 ). In cells treated with lipopolysaccharide and A?42, CDDO-methyl ester decreased microglial activation, cytokine levels, and reactive oxygen species, and enhanced phagocytic activity of microglia. In our CDDO-MA-treated mice, activation of microglia was reduced overall, but was increased in the immediate vicinity of plaques. A similar observation was reported in Tg2576 mice treated with curcumin, in which reactive microglia was decreased overall but increased in a ring around plaques ( Lim et al. 2001 ). Thus, one possible mechanism for the protective effect of CDDO-MA could be decreased inflammation and increased microglial phagocytosis of A? and amyloid plaque, as supported by increased ED-1 staining around plaques. A second possible mechanism to explain the beneficial effects of 3-month administration of CDDO-MA could involve its antioxidant properties. CDDO-MA directly inhibited protein oxidation in vitro and reduced protein carbonyl levels in Tg19959 mice. CDDO-MA has been shown to up-regulate Nrf2/ARE-regulated antioxidant enzymes in cultured cells in a time-dependent fashion. In our mice, we did not detect coordinated up-regulation of a battery of Nrf2/ARE genes, although we cannot completely rule out such up-regulation for technical reasons. For example, the mice were fed ad libitum and may not have been killed at an optimal time point after feeding. Moreover, there was up-regulation of HO-1. HO-1 is found in both neurons and glia and is induced by A?, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory stimuli. HO-1 catabolizes heme into biliverdin, Fe2+, and carbon monoxide ( Schipper 2004 ). Biliverdin and bilirubin are free radical scavengers ( Stocker 2004 ). Carbon monoxide is an activator of guanylate cyclase like nitric oxide ( Verma et al. 1993 ), and recent data suggest that nitric oxide might be beneficial in AD – depletion of NOS exacerbated AD-like pathology and behavioral impairments in APP transgenic mice ( Colton et al. 2008 ; Wilcock et al. 2008 ). Three-month administration of CDDO-MA improved spatial memory retention and reduced A? levels and plaque deposition early in the disease course, probably by reducing inflammation, enhancing phagocytosis of A? and plaque, and decreasing oxidative stress. Thus, CDDO-MA and other more potent up-regulators of endogenous antioxidant and anti-inflammatory programs represent promising avenues of investigation for AD therapy.
