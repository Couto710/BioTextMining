The Association of SNPs in ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1, and ADIPOR2 with Insulin Sensitivity in a Cohort of Adolescents and their Parents Few studies have examined the association of SNPs in the adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and adiponectin receptor 1 and 2 (ADIPOR1, ADIPOR2) genes with the euglycemic clamp, i.e. the gold standard measure of insulin sensitivity. The association of comprehensive tag SNPs in these genes with insulin sensitivity was examined in a cohort of adolescents and their parents. Probands and siblings (n = 441, mean age = 17.9 years) were recruited along with their parents (n = 262, mean age = 47.9 years).Typed SNPs included 21 SNPs in ADIPOQ, 7 SNPs in ADIPOR1, and 13 SNPs in ADIPOR2. Mixed model linear regression was used to test the association of SNPs with euglycemic-clamp derived insulin sensitivity. All analyses were stratified by race. After corrections to account for multiple testing and the linkage disequilibrium structure of the genes, one SNP in the ADIPOQ gene (rs822393) was significantly associated with insulin sensitivity in white subjects. In whites, six SNPs in ADIPOQ, one SNP in ADIPOR1 and one SNP in ADIPOR2 were associated with insulin sensitivity at the p < .05 level. In African Americans, two SNPs in ADIPOR1 were associated with insulin sensitivity at the p < .05 level. These results suggest that a variant in the ADIPOQ gene influences levels of insulin sensitivity and age may modify the effects of this variant. There are several other variants in ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1, and ADIPOR2 that may influence insulin sensitivity and these variants should be further investigated in other populations.  Results Cohort Characteristics Table 1 lists characteristics of the individuals included in the study by self-identified race and generation. Parents had significantly greater mean BMI (p < 0.0001) than their offspring but mean insulin sensitivity was similar (p = 0.22).The majority of offspring were Tanner stage 5 or greater, but 22.3% of white offspring and 25 % of African American offspring had not yet reached Tanner stage 5. The majority of parents were female while the majority of offspring, particularly African American offspring, were male. Five white parents and one African American offspring did not report a diagnosis of diabetes but had fasting glucose measurements (range 127–137 mg/dl) that met the ADA definition of diabetes. Exclusion of these individuals from the study population did not materially change any results presented in this analysis. Genotypes Table 2 lists the rs numbers (SNP ID), chromosome positions, and previously used labels for the SNPs included in this analysis. Few SNPs encoded amino acid changes. Because ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1, and ADIPOR2 have been studied extensively, nearly all the SNPs had been reported in the literature and thus had labels from previous studies. Because of the large number of SNPs typed, a cut-off of p < 0.01 was set to define SNPs in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium. Based on this cut-off, only 1 SNP (rs7975600 in ADIPOR2) was in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium in both races. This SNP was not included in association analyses. Supplementary Figures 1 – 6 show the pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns as expressed by r2 across ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1, and ADIPOR2 in African Americans and whites. Because only the minimum number of SNPs required to tag the gene (in whites) were selected, there is relatively low-LD between the SNPs in each gene. As expected, the LD between SNPs is also lower in the African American population as compared to the white population. Single SNP Associations Figure 1 shows p-values (on a –log scale) for the single SNP association analyses with insulin sensitivity in African Americans, whites, and white generational subgroups. Using the pre-specified thresholds for significance (p < .0037 for ADIPOQ, p < .0085 for ADIPOR1, p < .0063 for ADIPOR2), one ADIPOQ SNP (rs822393) was significantly associated (p = .0034) with insulin sensitivity in whites. After adjustment for age and sex, the SNP rs822393 accounted for 1.9 % of the variance in clamp-derived insulin sensitivity. In whites, several additional SNPs in ADIPOQ, one SNP in ADIPOR1, and one SNP in ADIPOR2 were associated with insulin sensitivity at the p < .05 level. In African Americans, two SNPs in ADIPOR1 were associated at the p < .05 level. The association of SNPs in ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1, and ADIPOR2 were also tested with HOMA-IR, a surrogate measure of insulin resistance; no associations of this trait with HOMA-IR met the pre-specified levels of significance. The association of rs822393 with insulin sensitivity was more highly significant (based on p-values) in the parents (p = .01), as compared to the offspring (p = .14), although there was not sufficient power to conduct a formal test of interaction for this association with age. There was no evidence of significant interaction of this association with BMI and the significance of the association was similar in those with BMI ? 25 (p = .0255) and those with BMI over 25 (p = .0174).Additionally, there was no evidence of significant interaction with BMI for any of the suggestive (p < .05) associations reported in this paper. Table 3 lists adjusted means by genotype for all SNPs associated with insulin sensitivity at the p < .05 level. For five ADIPOQ SNPs (rs4632532, rs266729, rs182052, rs7649121, and the single significant SNP, rs822393) the pattern of genotype means was extremely similar. When two of these SNPs were included together in a regression model, the ? estimates for SNP rs822393 were attenuated slightly. Generational subgroup (parents and offspring) genotype means were calculated for SNPs rs822393. The pattern of genotype means was similar in both subgroups, although the differences between the means were more pronounced in the parents ( Supplementary Table 1 ).

Discussion In this study, one SNP in the ADIPOQ gene (rs822393) was significantly associated with insulin sensitivity in whites. There were several other suggestive (p < .05) associations of SNPs in ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1, and ADIPOR2. In whites, four of the suggestive ADIPOQ SNPs (rs4632532, rs266729, rs182052, rs7649121) were in moderate (r2 = .33–.67) LD with the significant SNP, rs822393. Given these findings, and the similarity between the genotype means for these SNPs, all of these associations may be driven by the association of rs822393 with insulin sensitivity or by the association of an untyped variant in high LD with rs822393. As the size of the ? estimates for SNP rs822393 were attenuated slightly when another of the correlated SNPs was included in the model, these associations may be driven by an untyped variant. None of the other suggestive SNPs in ADIPOQ (in whites) or in ADIPOR1 (in African Americans) can be explained due to high LD between SNPs and thus these associations may represent the effects of multiple genetic variants on the expression or activity of the gene. With one exception (rs7539542), the SNPs found to be associated with insulin sensitivity in the African Americans were different from those associated with white subjects in this study (and rs7539542 showed differing genotype specific means across the races, with different alleles being associated with increased insulin sensitivity).These findings may be due to the different patterns of linkage disequilibrium present in the two racial groups. The differing results between the races also may be the result of different sample sizes between the white and African American study populations, or of different genetic variants acting in the two racial groups. In whites, the association of rs822393 and insulin sensitivity is stronger in the parents than the offspring. This could indicate that the influence of variants in adiponectin on insulin sensitivity may take many years to manifest (essentially, that many years of exposure to such variants are necessary in order for an effect to be seen).If this is the case, the effect of these variants would not yet be evident in adolescents, explaining the less significant association seen in the siblings and probands than in the parents. Although several previous studies have examined the association of clamp-derived insulin sensitivity with SNPs in ADIPOQ ( Buzzetti et al. 2007 ; Salmenniemi et al. 2005 ; Stumvoll et al. 2002 ; Ukkola et al. 2005 ; Vozarova de Courten et al. 2005 ), only one previous study used tag SNPs ( Vozarova de Courten et al. 2005 ), so there is little overlap between the results of this study and previous studies in the literature. Only one of the suggestive ADIPOQ SNPs has been examined previously in relation to insulin sensitivity;rs266729 was found to be significantly (p < .05) associated with clamp-derived insulin sensitivity in obese Italians ( Buzzetti et al. 2007 ) but was not significantly associated with the same phenotype in Pima Indians ( Vozarova de Courten et al. 2005 ). Only two previous studies have examined the association of ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 SNPs and clamp-derived insulin sensitivity ( Kantartzis et al. 2006 ; Stefan et al. 2005 ) with neither using a tag SNP approach; one of these studies included the SNP rs16928751 and concluded this SNP was not significantly associated with insulin sensitivity in a Caucasian cohort, mirroring the results of this study. Previous studies have examined the association of SNPs in ADIPOQ with HOMA-IR and found significant associations ( Hivert et al. 2008 ; Menzaghi et al. 2007 ). However, the results of this study suggest that SNPs associated with clamp-derived insulin sensitivity are not associated with HOMA-IR, possibly due to differences in the traits. The lack of replication of significant HOMA-IR / ADIPOQ SNP associations in this cohort can be explained by a relatively small sample size (compared to studies measuring insulin sensitivity surrogates) and a higher threshold for significance. The results from the present study support previous results in this study population suggesting that the genetic determinants of clamp-derived insulin sensitivity differ from those of surrogate measures of insulin resistance such as fasting insulin or HOMA-IR ( Rasmussen-Torvik et al. 2007 )). As with any genetic association study, it will be necessary to replicate these results in unrelated study populations. Given the results of this study, it is important to conduct the replication studies using clamp-derived measures of insulin sensitivity rather than surrogates, and the replication cohort should include individuals from multiple generations. Of course, the use of the clamp (an invasive and time-consuming procedure) will limit the size of these studies and so expectations about the level of statistical significance must be adjusted appropriately. Studies will also be needed to test the association of tag SNPs (particularly rs822393) in these three genes with insulin sensitivity in other ethnic groups. The results in African Americans in this study must be viewed with caution; the number of African Americans was very small, tag SNPs were selected for a Caucasian population (and thus likely did not adequately tag the genes for the African American population), significance thresholds were calculated for Caucasian populations (and this may have been too generous for African American populations), and no genomic control markers were typed to address confounding by varying levels of admixture in this population. However the moderate association (p < .05) of two SNPs in ADIPOR1, despite the small sample size in this study, should encourage others to more fully investigate these associations in a larger African American cohort. In summary, this study tested the association of comprehensive tag SNPs in ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1, and ADIPOR2 with clamp-derived insulin sensitivity. One SNP, rs822393, was significantly associated with insulin sensitivity in whites. There were several additional SNPs with suggestive associations to insulin sensitivity in both whites and African Americans. These genetic results lend support to epidemiologic studies that have found associations between circulating adiponectin and insulin sensitivity ( Chen et al. 2005 ; Tschritter et al. 2003 ; Weyer et al. 2001 ) and to bench studies showing that adiponectin (administered intravenously or through genetic up-regulation) increases insulin sensitivity in rodents ( Yamauchi et al. 2001 ; Yamauchi et al. 2003 ) and strengthens the argument that changes in adiponectin level or activity cause insulin resistance.  Discussion In this study, one SNP in the ADIPOQ gene (rs822393) was significantly associated with insulin sensitivity in whites. There were several other suggestive (p < .05) associations of SNPs in ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1, and ADIPOR2. In whites, four of the suggestive ADIPOQ SNPs (rs4632532, rs266729, rs182052, rs7649121) were in moderate (r2 = .33–.67) LD with the significant SNP, rs822393. Given these findings, and the similarity between the genotype means for these SNPs, all of these associations may be driven by the association of rs822393 with insulin sensitivity or by the association of an untyped variant in high LD with rs822393. As the size of the ? estimates for SNP rs822393 were attenuated slightly when another of the correlated SNPs was included in the model, these associations may be driven by an untyped variant. None of the other suggestive SNPs in ADIPOQ (in whites) or in ADIPOR1 (in African Americans) can be explained due to high LD between SNPs and thus these associations may represent the effects of multiple genetic variants on the expression or activity of the gene. With one exception (rs7539542), the SNPs found to be associated with insulin sensitivity in the African Americans were different from those associated with white subjects in this study (and rs7539542 showed differing genotype specific means across the races, with different alleles being associated with increased insulin sensitivity).These findings may be due to the different patterns of linkage disequilibrium present in the two racial groups. The differing results between the races also may be the result of different sample sizes between the white and African American study populations, or of different genetic variants acting in the two racial groups. In whites, the association of rs822393 and insulin sensitivity is stronger in the parents than the offspring. This could indicate that the influence of variants in adiponectin on insulin sensitivity may take many years to manifest (essentially, that many years of exposure to such variants are necessary in order for an effect to be seen).If this is the case, the effect of these variants would not yet be evident in adolescents, explaining the less significant association seen in the siblings and probands than in the parents.

However the moderate association (p < .05) of two SNPs in ADIPOR1, despite the small sample size in this study, should encourage others to more fully investigate these associations in a larger African American cohort. In summary, this study tested the association of comprehensive tag SNPs in ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1, and ADIPOR2 with clamp-derived insulin sensitivity. One SNP, rs822393, was significantly associated with insulin sensitivity in whites. There were several additional SNPs with suggestive associations to insulin sensitivity in both whites and African Americans. These genetic results lend support to epidemiologic studies that have found associations between circulating adiponectin and insulin sensitivity ( Chen et al. 2005 ; Tschritter et al. 2003 ; Weyer et al. 2001 ) and to bench studies showing that adiponectin (administered intravenously or through genetic up-regulation) increases insulin sensitivity in rodents ( Yamauchi et al. 2001 ; Yamauchi et al. 2003 ) and strengthens the argument that changes in adiponectin level or activity cause insulin resistance.
