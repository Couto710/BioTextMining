Potent s -cis -Locked Bithiazole Correctors of ?F508 Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrance Conductance Regulator Cellular Processing for Cystic Fibrosis Therapy ? § N -(5-(2-(5-Chloro-2-methoxyphenylamino)thiazol-4-yl)-4-methylthiazol-2-yl)pivalamide 1 (compound 15Jf ) was found previously to correct defective cellular processing of the cystic fibrosis protein ?F508-CFTR. Eight C4?-C5 C,C -bond-controlling bithiazole analogs of 1 were designed, synthesized, and evaluated to establish that constraining rotation about the bithiazole-tethering has a significant effect on corrector activity. For example, constraining the C4?-C5 bithiazole tether in the s -cis conformation [ N -(2-(5-chloro-2-methoxyphenyl-amino)-7,8-dihydro-6 H -cyclohepta[1,2- d :3,4- d ?]bithiazole-2?-yl)pivalamide; 29 ] results in improved corrector activity. Heteroatom placement in the bithaizole core is also critical as evidenced by the decisive loss of corrector activity with s -cis constrained N -(2-(5-chloro-2-methoxyphenylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4 H -cyclohepta[1,2- d :3,4- d ?]bithiazole-2?-yl)pivalamide 33 . In addition, computational models were utilized to examine the conformational preferences for select model systems. Following our analysis, the “s -cis locked” cycloheptathiazolothiazole 29 was found to be the most potent bithiazole corrector, with an IC50 of ~450 nM.  Introduction Cystic fibrosis (CF), an inherited disease that afflicts ~1 in 2,500 Caucasian individuals, 1 is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR gene encodes a cAMP-regulated chloride channel expressed at the apical membrane of epithelial cells in various tissues (lung, pancreas, testes, and others 2 , 3 ) with the primary cause of mortality being chronic lung infection and deterioration of lung function. ?F508-CFTR, the most common CF-producing mutation, has a phenylalanine deletion at residue 508 of CFTR and is present in at least one allele of ~90% of CF patients. 1 ?F508-CFTR is misfolded, retained at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and rapidly degraded. 4 Despite the multiplicity of cellular defects associated with the ?F508 mutation, small-molecule therapy of CF caused by the ?F508 mutation is thought to have considerable promise. 5 , 6 Such therapy may require compounds with two complementary modes of action – a ‘corrector’ to facilitate ?F508-CFTR folding and plasma membrane targeting, and a ‘potentiator’ to improve ?F508-CFTR chloride channel function. However, a highly effective corrector that restores normal folding of ?F508-CFTR may obviate the need for a separate potentiator. Nanomolar-potency ?F508-CFTR potentiators have already been identified and characterized. 6 The complex, multistep nature of protein folding and trafficking presents a significant challenge in identifying potent, selective correctors of defective ?F508-CFTR cellular processing. We previously reported the identification and characterization of ?F508-CFTR correctors by screening a collection of 150,000 diverse small molecules utilizing Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) epithelial cells co-expressing ?F508-CFTR and the halide-sensitive fluorescent protein YFP-H148Q/I152L. 7 ?F508-CFTR–facilitated iodide influx was determined for each test compound by the kinetics of decreasing YFP fluorescence following addition of extracellular iodide in the presence of the potentiators genistein 8 and forskolin. 6 , 9 Analyses of the specificity, cellular mechanism, and efficacy in human CF cells of four chemical classes of active compounds identified from the screen established methyl-bithiazoles 10 as most promising for further development. A subsequent synthesis and screening study of 148 methylbithiazole analogs focused on the peripheral amide and aniline substructures (e.g., blue substructures in the generalized methylbithiazole depicted in Chart 1 ) established initial structure activity relationship (SAR) data for this class of correctors with methylbithiazole corrector 1 (compound 15Jf in our previous study) having the greatest corrector efficacy. 11 The purpose of the study here was to explore the bithiazole core structure of 1 (red substructure in 1 ; Chart 1 ) to establish requisite structural features of the bis-heterocyclic portion of bithiazole ?F508-CFTR correctors.  Results and Discussion The first objective was to determine if the bithiazole substructure of 1 plays a crucial role in ?F508-CFTR corrector activity or if it simply orchestrates the proper 3-dimensional placement of the flanking pivalamide and 5-chloro-2-methoxyaniline substructures. To accomplish this, the C 2 symmetry of 3-chloropentane-2,4-dione ( 2 ) 12 was divergently exploited to prepare, from this one starting material, both 1 11 and 7 as detailed in Scheme 1 . The preparation of corrector 1 was accomplished by condensation of chlorodiketone 2 with N -pivaloylcarbamimidothioic acid ( 3 ) 13 to give a 1-(thiazol-5-yl)ethanone intermediate. 11 Bromination 14 alpha to the carbonyl of this thiazole and subsequent condensation with N -(5-chloro-2-methoxyphenyl)carbamimidothioic acid ( 4 ) delivers 1 . By transposing the thiazole formation order, analog 7 is obtained from the same starting material ( 2 ) as 1 . That is, condensation of 2 first with 4 followed by ?-bromination and subsequent condensation with the equivalent of 3 (e.g., thiourea condensation followed by N -acylation with pivaloyl chloride) delivers transposed bithiazole 7 where the bithiazole core has been inverted relative to the topography set by the appended pivalamide and 5-chloro-2-methoxyaniline substructures (compare blue substructures in 1 with red substructures in bithiazole transposed 7 in Scheme 1 ). Figure 1 shows that this bithiazole transposition in 7 results in near complete loss of ?F508-CFTR corrector activity as assayed in FRT epithelial cells stably coexpressing human ?F508-CFTR and the high-sensitivity halide-sensing fluorescent protein YFP-H148Q/I152L as described previously. 6b Since the conformational biases of 1 and 7 should be nearly identical, this dramatic change in corrector activity has three important implications: (i) proper 3-dimensional display of the pivalamide and 5-chloro-2-methoxyaniline substructures is insufficient for corrector activity; (ii) the substituted bithiazole core is a significant contributor to the activity of 1 ; and (iii) while the target of 1 remains unknown, the remarkable activity differences for these two quite similar bithiazoles suggests that the activity of 1 may be the consequence of a specific ?F508-CFTR binding event. To initially explore the implications of (ii) above, the next objective was to partially modify the bithiazole core structure by replacing one of the thiazole rings with a phenyl ring. The chemistry to accomplish this objective is detailed in Scheme 2 and starts with 1-(3-aminophenyl)ethanone. N -Acylation of the aniline moiety with pivaloyl chloride was followed by bromination alpha to the carbonyl. Subsequent condensation of this bromoacetophenone with 4 delivered the 4-phenylthiazole analog 10 . Starting with 1-(3-nitrophenyl)propan-1-one, a sequence consisting of bromination, thiazole formation, Sn(II)-mediated nitro reduction 15 and subsequent N -acylation delivers the 5-methylthiazole analog 13 . ?F508-CFTR assay results for 10 and 13 reveal that each of these 4-phenylthiazole compounds have no ?F508-CFTR corrector activity (see Figure S1 in Supporting Information ). The lack of corrector activity for 7, 10 , and 13 is consistent with the bithiazole core being an important determinant of the corrector activity of 1 . We therefore designed bithiazole analogs that would probe structural and conformational features of this central bis-heterocycle. One aspect of the 4?-methyl-4,5?-bithiazole moiety that could greatly affect its activity involves the dihedral angle of the thiazole-tethering C(4)–C(5?) bond (see Chart 1 for the numbering scheme). As depicted in Figure 2a , the 4?-methyl-4,5?-bithiazole system can adopt two approximately planar conformations: a conformation where the C(4?)-CH3 substituent is s-trans to the C(5)-H, and a conformation where the C(4?)-CH3 substituent is s -cis to the C(5)-H. Interestingly, based on quantum chemical calculations ( Figure 2a ), the s -cis conformer is actually slightly lower in energy (by ~1 kcal/mol), despite the potential steric clash between the C(4?)-CH3 and the C(5)-H. This appears to be the result of an attractive S•••N interaction. Although there are precedents for S•••X interactions, 16 we did not initially appreciate their relevance to our bithiazole systems. The relevance of such interactions to the conformations of thiazole-heterocycle systems was brought to our attention by Dr. Michael Bartberger (Amgen; personal communication to D.J.T. in 2007). Note that the preferred conformation of the amide group in 1 (that shown in Figure 2a ) also displays an S•••X interaction, in this case between a thiazole S and the amide carbonyl O. 17 The s -trans conformer is also twisted from planarity, although planarization of this structure ( Figure 2a , left) is associated with a very small energetic penalty. 18 The barrier for conversion of the s -cis to the s -trans conformation is only 2–3 kcal/mol, so these structures are expected to interconvert freely in solution. However, as depicted in Figure 2b , the structural profiles of the s -trans and s -cis bithiazole conformations are quite distinct from one another in how they present bithiazole structural features such as H-bond donors, H-bond acceptors, and the hydrophobic C(4?)-CH3. Two questions arise: does s -trans /s -cis conformational interplay influence the activity of 1 and, if so, would providing a conformational bias to this feature lead to improved activity? It was initially reasoned that increasing the steric bulk of the C(5)-substituent on the bithiazole core would effectively preclude access to the s -cis conformation. The C(4?), C(5) dimethyl analog 18 (see Scheme 3[a] ) would have been our preferred target for this study because the presumed hydrophobic methyl pocket requirements of 1 would have been unperturbed. That target preference was, however, offset by retro-synthetic considerations. Just as symmetrical 2 is an ideal precursor to 1 because the first thiazole-forming condensation can occur redundantly on either carbonyl, 4-chloroheptane-3,5-dione is an ideal precursor to 17 – the C(4?)-CH2CH3/C(5)-CH3 analog of 1 . A similar retro-synthetic analysis of the C(4?)-CH3/C(5)-CH3 analog of 18 points to unsymmetrical 3-chlorohexane-2,4-dione as the starting material, but 18 encounters a vexing carbonyl selectivity issue in the first thiazole-forming condensation reaction. For this reason, bithiazole 17 was selected as an initial probe of the s -trans /s -cis conformation questions. Its synthesis – with the pivalamide and 5-chloro-2-methoxyaniline substructures fixed as in 1 – was accomplished in four steps as outlined in Scheme 3[a] . Corrector activity assay revealed that 17 , while not as active as 1 , is a better corrector than 7, 10 and 13 , which supports the notion that the substituted bithiazole core is a critical contributor to the corrector activity of 1 (see Scheme 3[b] ). A conformational profile for 17 is shown in Figure 3 . Note that, despite the potential steric clash that was engineered into 17, the s -cis conformer is again slightly lower in energy than the s -trans conformer. The s -cis minimum is now significantly distorted from planarity (twisted by ~55°), however, presumably representing a compromise between the favorable S•••N interaction and steric repulsion between the ethyl and methyl groups. The s -trans minimum is also more twisted than it was for 1 . Planarization of either of these structures is associated with a significant energetic penalty ( Figure 3 , far left and far right). Thus, if an approximately planar conformation, be it s -trans or s -cis , is required for binding, then the penalty associated with achieving such a conformation (3–7 kcal/mol) may account for the slightly reduced activity of 17 relative to 1 . Since 17 is not as active as 1 , bithiazole analog 22 , in which the C(4?)-CH3 of 1 is replaced with a C(4?)-H to remove this impediment to achieving a planar conformation, was synthesized to determine if such an analog would improve corrector activity. Retro-synthetic analysis of 22 (see Scheme 4 ) does not point back to a symmetric dicarbonyl starting material. Rather, the retrosynthetic precursor in this strategy would be 2-halo-3-oxobutanal, which is known as its bromo analog. Indeed, 2-bromo-3-oxobutanal has been employed in the regioselective preparation of imidazole, 19 oxazole, 20 and thiazole 21 heterocycles. However, as an alternate option, a quite different route to 5-substituted-2-aminothiazoles starting from commercial 2-aminothiazole has been reported by Katritzky. 22 In that work, 2-aminothiazole is protected as its N , N -bis(trimethylsilyl) derivative and subsequently regioselective C(5)-lithiated. This latter route was selected for our work because this strategy could be readily used to introduce various groups at the C(5) position of the 2-aminothiazole ring. The C(4?), C(5)-unsubstituted analog 22 was obtained in five steps from 2-aminothiazole as outlined in Scheme 4 . Figure 4a shows that 22 has a comparable IC50 to 1 . The s -trans and s -cis minima for bithiazole 22 are both planar and extremely close in energy ( Figure 4b ), providing circumstantial evidence that an approximately planar conformation of 22 is likely the active conformation. Following from these insights with corrector 22 , we next investigated bithiazole methyl placement with analog 25 (see Scheme 5 ). This compound is the C(4?)/C(5) methyl–hydrogen interchange analog of 1 . By utilizing a modification of Katritzky’s 2-aminothiazole protection/C(5)-lithiation strategy employed in Scheme 4 but replacing acetaldehyde with propionaldehyde, the methyl–hydrogen transposed bithiazole 25 was obtained in five steps from 2-aminothiazole. Figure 5 shows the corrector activity data of 25 compared with 1 and 22 . These data support the notion that methyl placement is important. Indeed, that 1 is a more effective corrector than 25 suggests that a C(4?)-CH3 better addresses a hydrophobic binding pocket than does a C(5)-CH3 placement. The structure-activity relationships above support the notion that a planar bithiazole conformation is required for bithiazole ?F508-CFTR corrector activity. While both 22 and 1 accommodate that requirement, neither constrains the bithiazole moiety to be planar nor do they predispose it in either the s -cis or s -trans conformation. To address these issues, the synthesis of conformationally locked analogs was undertaken, beginning with a compound constrained to be s -cis . Of the structural options considered, cycloheptathiazolothiazole 29 appeared to be the best s -cis alternative because (a) the corresponding cyclohexa-analog would be susceptible to aromatization (an event that would reduce solubility) and (b) precursors to the cycloocta-analog would be more difficult to prepare. Our route to 29 starts with cycloheptane-1,3-dione and is outlined in Scheme 6 . Cycloheptathiazolothiazole 33 , the N S transposed isomer of 29 , was also prepared. The route to 33 is related to that used for the synthesis of 29 except that the 2-(5-chloro-2-methoxyanilino)thiazole heterocycle is now introduced first followed then by the 2-( N -pivalamido)thiazole heterocycle ( Scheme 7 ) by analogy with the strategy outlined in Scheme 1 . The ?F508-CFTR corrector activity data for cycloheptathiazolothiazoles 29 and 33 are shown relative to 22 and 1 in Figure 6a . Given that 29 is an effective corrector and cannot adopt an s -trans conformation, we conclude that an s -cis conformation is required for bithiazole activity. Moreover, the fact that bithiazole 17 is a relatively ineffective ?F508-CFTR corrector supports the contention that an approximately planar s -cis conformation is ideal for maximizing activity. Our calculations indicate that the preferred conformation for 29 involves essentially coplanar thiazole rings ( Figure 6b ), although twisting from planarity by up to 25° is associated with a penalty of just over 1 kcal/mol (see Figure S2 in Supporting Information ). Correctors 29 , 22 and 1 can readily adopt a conformation with coplanar thiazole rings and, consequently, each of these has strong ?F508-CFTR corrector activity. The fact that s -cis -locked corrector 29 is the most active of these compounds is likely a result of removal of the entropy penalty expected upon binding by the conformationally flexible 1 and 22 by conformational preorganization in 29 . Bithiazole 33 , the N S transposed isomer of 29 , is inactive even though it can place the pivalamide and 5-chloro-2-methoxyaniline substructures in similar orientations relative to the most active compound, corrector 29 . These data are consistent with proper placement of the four bithiazole heteroatoms being an important structural determinant in bithiazole ?F508-CFTR corrector activity. The final question regards the structure of the most potent activator cycloheptathiazolothiazole 29 ; specifically, did the N -acylation with pivaloyl chloride occur at the 2-amino position to give 29 or did this N -acylation occur to give one of the potential products 34–36 (see Chart 2 )? Spectroscopic analysis of this reaction product proved difficult to unambiguously establish which product had been formed. Therefore, X-ray quality crystals were obtained and crystallographic analysis established that the sole product of this reaction was, indeed, 29 .  Computational Methods Model systems of 1, 17, 22 , and 29 with the t -butyl group replaced by a methyl group and the methoxy and chloro groups on the aniline replaced by hydrogens were utilized. Preliminary calculations (see Figure S3 in Supporting Information ) suggested that the presence of the methoxy and chloro functional groups does not significantly affect the relative energies of the two aniline conformers. In all cases, the lowest energy aniline and amide conformers (which are also consistent with the crystal structure of 29 , see Chart 2 ) were utilized. All calculations were performed with the GAUSSIAN03 27 software suite. Geometries were optimized without symmetry constraints using the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) method. 28 All stationary points were characterized as either minima or transition state structures via frequency calculations, and the reported energies include unscaled zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections. Single point calculations in water were completed utilizing the CPCM solvation model and UAKS radii. 29 Structural diagrams were produced using Ball & Stick version 4.0. 30 See Supporting Information for coordinates of all computed structures and details on additional model systems.  Supplementary Material 1_si_001  Conclusions In conclusion, a systematic analysis of lead bithiazole core ?F508-CFTR corrector 1 has been reported. Loss of corrector activity with analogs 7 , 10 , and 13 is consistent with the bithiazole substructure playing a central role in the activity of 1 . Conformational analysis of the thiazole-tethering C(4)–C(5?) bond suggested that two distinctly different conformations – one where the C(4?)-CH3 substituent is s -trans to the C(5)-H and another where the C(4?)-CH3 substituent is s -cis to the C(5)-H – are available to the 4?-methyl-4,5?-bithiazole moiety of 1 . Activity data for bithiazole analogs 17, 22 and 25 , as well as the s -cis -locked analog 29 and its transposed counterpart 33 indicate that an approximately planar s -cis bithiazole conformation, with proper placement of the four bithiazole heteroatoms, is likely the active presentation of 1 .  Experimental ?508-CFTR corrector activity assay FRT epithelial cells stably coexpressing human ?F508-CFTR and the high-sensitivity halide-sensing fluorescent protein YFP-H148Q/I152L 7a were used as described previously. 7b Cells were grown at 37° C (95% air/5% CO2) for 24 h and then incubated for 16 – 20 h with 50 ?L of medium containing the test compound. At the time of the assay, cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with PBS containing forskolin (20 ?M) and genistein (50 ?M) for 20 min. Measurements were carried out using FLUOstar fluorescence plate readers (Optima; BMG LABTECH Gmbh), each equipped with 500 ± 10 nm excitation and 535 ± 15 nm emission filters (Chroma Technology Corp.). Each well was assayed individually for I? influx by recording fluorescence continuously (200 ms per point) for 2 s (baseline) and then for 12 s after rapid (<1 second) addition of 165 ?L PBS in which 137 mM Cl? was replaced by I?. I? influx rate was computed by fitting the final 11.5 s of the data to an exponential for extrapolation of initial slope and normalizing for background-subtracted initial fluorescence.
