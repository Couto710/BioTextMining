VEGFR3: A New Target for Antiangiogenesis Therapy? VEGFR-3 signaling plays an important role in developmental, physiological, and pathological angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Tammela et al. in Nature show that VEGFR-3, via Notch regulation, is present on endothelial tip cells and is critical to sprouting angiogenesis.
