Non-Peptidic Small Molecule Inhibitors against Bcl-2 for Cancer Therapy A critical regulator of the apoptotic machinery is the Bcl-2 family proteins whose over expression confers a protective effect on malignant cells against death signals of apoptosis. Cancer cells that are resistant to various anti-cancer drugs and treatment regimen are found to over express these Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, Bcl-w and A1/Bfl1. In recent years there has been an exponential growth in the identification as well as synthesis of non-peptidic cell permeable small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of protein-protein interaction. The focus of this article is on inhibitors of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. This review summarizes an up to date knowledge of the available SMIs, their mode of action as well as their current status in preclinical as well as clinical development.
