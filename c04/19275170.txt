Antiseizure Activity of Novel Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (A) Receptor Subtype-Selective Benzodiazepine Analogs in Mice and Rat Models The antiseizure activity of benzodiazepines (BDZs) 1-5 in mice and rats as animal models is described. These BDZs have selective efficacy for ?2?3?2 and ?3?3?2 GABAA-receptors. Significant anticonvulsant activity with little or no motor impairment and therapeutic indexes (TI) of 2.8-44 (mice, ip) were observed for compounds 2-4 in the subcutaneous metrazole seizure (scMET) test. In rats orally (po) the TI was >5 to 105. These compounds represent novel leads in the search for anticonvulsants devoid of sedative, ataxic and amnestic side effects.
