Modeling Thyroid Cancer in the Mouse Thyroid carcinomas, the most common endocrine tumors in humans, have an increasing incidence in the U.S. and worldwide. There are four major types of thyroid cancers: papillary, follicular, anaplastic, and medullary carcinomas. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the identification of genetic alterations in thyroid carcinomas, particularly, papillary and medullary thyroid cancers. Mouse models of thyroid cancer are valuable tools in elucidating molecular genetic changes underlying thyroid carcinogenesis and in identifying potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Representative mouse models of papillary, follicular, and medullary carcinomas are reviewed here with particular emphasis on those for follicular thyroid carcinomas. Challenges for further development in the modeling of thyroid cancer will also be discussed.
