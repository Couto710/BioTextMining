CCL genes in multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus This follow up study aims to refine the roles of previously suggested candidate genes (CC chemokine ligands or CCLs) in multiple sclerosis (MS), and to test these markers in another autoimmune disorder, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). After stringent correction for multiple testing, we reject the importance of previously suggested borderline associations with CCLs in MS. A new finding is the differential distribution of CCL8 marker alleles and a haplotype in extreme severity subgroups of MS. In SLE, this study reveals strong associations with a marker and a haplotype encompassing the CCL14 gene, which suggests that a lupus relevant variant may lie within or in the proximity of this haplotype. Published by Elsevier B.V.  4. Discussion 4.1. Candidate genes of inflammation A phenotypic characteristic of MS is heterogeneity defined by various balances of inflammation and neurodegeneration ( Lucchinetti et al., 2000 ; Bielekova et al., 2005 ). Neurodegeneration is the major pathological correlate of disability ( Zivadinov and Bakshi, 2004 ), and inflammation can both directly and indirectly contribute to it ( Bielekova et al., 2005 ). These observations influenced our inflammatory candidate gene selection in two earlier studies that revealed modest but reproducible observations for variants of CCL genes ( Vyskina et al., 2005a ; Vyshkina and Kalman, 2005 , 2006 ). These previous SNP association studies were performed in independent cohorts of 257 and 361 MS families with various structures, and in consensus suggested haplotypes (but not individual markers) associated with the disease ( Fig. 1 ). Associations with two rare haplotypes in CCL15 were significant in the TRANSMIT analyses even after correction for multiple testing, and MS-associated haplotypes within both CCL15 and CCL3 overlapped in the phase I and phase II studies ( Vyshkina et al., 2005 ; Vyshkina and Kalman, 2005 ). Here we aimed to conclude our analyses concerning these candidate markers in MS, and to generate comparative data in another autoimmune disease, SLE. 4.2. Present findings in MS 4.2.1. SNP markers in CCL genes tested in MS In the present cohort of 523 MS patients and 466 controls, we only detected weak p -values for associations with previously highlighted markers and haplotypes, which all became non-significant after Bonferroni correction. Assuming a genotypic relative risk of 1.3 for heterozygous and 1.8 for homozygous state of the high risk allele with 0.20 frequency, we had 73% power to detect a p = 0.05, while we had 80% power for risk alleles with 0.25 frequency and only 30% power for risk alleles with 0.05 or lower frequency ( Purcell et al., 2003 ). Therefore, this study unambiguously excluded the association of the tested gene markers with MS since most markers had an allele frequency of 0.2 or higher. However, it is important noting that no direct marker only haplotype associations were detected in the previous CCL studies, and the frequency of all CCL haplotypes which showed association with the disease was very low (0.02) ( Vyshkina et al., 2005 ; Vyshkina and Kalman, 2005 ). Therefore, the present study is in agreement with the data of the recent WGA study that revealed no significant p -values in the proximity of our CCL gene markers ( IMSGC, 2007 ). The biological significance of previously detected associations of MS with low frequency haplotypes in CCL15 and CCL3 genes remains uncertain ( Vyshkina et al., 2005 ; Vyshkina and Kalman, 2005 ). 4.2.2. Candidate markers in subgroups of MS Testing the distribution of all CCL markers in the PP-MS/PR-MS vs. RR-MS/SP-MS subgroups resulted in no significant observation. However, stratification of MS patients into mild and severe subgroups revealed a differential distribution of a PG19–PG22–PG23 haplotype within the CCL8 gene. The severe subgroup had an increased frequency of the C–G–C haplotype, suggesting that these variants may increase the probability of developing a more rapidly progressing form of MS. CCL8 is highly expressed by astrocytes and microglia in active plaques and attracts CCR2, CCR3 and CCR5 positive monocytes and macrophages to lesions of MS and EAE ( McManus et al., 1998 ; Banisor et al., 2005 ). The CCL8–CCR2 interaction was suggested to be involved in the fine tuning of immune response ( O’Boyle et al., 2007 ). Therefore, the differential distribution of the CCL8 haplotype may result in a differential immune modulatory effect in extreme severity subgroups of MS. We could not evaluate the marker distribution in more polarized severity subgroups because of the loss of power (e.g. using EDSS?3 at 10 years for defining mild MS would have included only 20 patients). Identifying disease modifying genes in MS has been impeded by several methodological difficulties (e.g. definition of outcome measures and selection of markers, cohort size and composition, methods of analyses) ( Kantarci et al., 2002 ). Numerous disease modifier candidates have been proposed, but only the HLA Class II variants have thus far survived scrutiny ( Kantarci et al., 2002 ). HLA DR alleles have a differential distribution in mild and severe subgroups of MS ( Barcellos and Thomson al., 2003 ; DeLuca et al., 2007 ; Ramagopalan et al., 2007 ), and epistatic interactions between HLA DR2 alleles in LD with each other determine clinical disease severity by differentially controlling T cell activation ( Gregersen et al., 2006 ). The disease modifying role of ApoE4 is still being debated ( Ramagopalan et al., 2007 ). This study suggests a new potential disease modifying candidate. 4.3. Findings in SLE 4.3.1. CCL gene SNP markers in SLE None but one of the tested markers showed association with SLE. The associations of PG28 (1641 bp from 3? UTR of CCL14) and the PG28–PG32 haplotype with SLE are novel findings, and the p -values are impressive considering the small size of the patient cohort. Among the markers defining this haplotype only PG29 (rs16971802) is a non-synonymous mutation. The current marker selection only allows a partial evaluation of LD in this region, but our preceding analyses with evenly distributed 232 markers in 17q11.2–q12 showed a large LD block encompassing CCL14–CCL15–CCL23–CCL18–CCL3–CCL4 ( Vyshkina et al., 2005 ). PG28–PG32 are located in this extensive LD block suggesting that a lupus relevant mutation may lie within or in the proximity of this haplotype, possibly within the CCL14 gene itself. CCL14 (HCC-2) was characterized at DNA, mRNA and protein levels only recently ( Pardigol et al., 1998 ), and its involvement in human diseases is still being explored. CCL14 binds to multiple CC chemokine receptors (CCR) including CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5 (this latter is a HIV-1 co-receptor). It may have functional significance in inhibiting HIV entry into CCR5 expressing cells ( Blain et al., 2007 ) and controlling allergic airway inflammation and growth of cancer ( Gupta et al., 2008 ). CCL14 has never been implicated in MS, and this is the first time when an association was detected in this region with SLE. However, a polymorphism in CCR5 was associated with SLE ( Mamtani et al., 2007 ), which further supports a potential role for the CCL14–CCR5 axis in lupus. CCL14 may represent one of the susceptibility genes in the 17p12–q11 region that has been considered a susceptibility locus in SLE ( Johansson et al., 2004 ). In summary, identification of non-HLA susceptibility markers in MS is hampered by their small effects and a genetic heterogeneity of the disease underscored by recent studies in very large cohorts ( Gregory et al., 2007 ; IMSGC, 2007 ; Lundmark et al., 2007 ). In the present follow up study, we excluded a major importance of CCL variants in MS. However, the increased frequency of the PG19–PG22–PG23 C–G–C haplotype (CCL8) in the severe and its decreased frequency in the mild subgroup of MS is a new finding which may have functional relevance and merit further evaluation. The associations of SLE with a SNP marker and haplotype in the CCL14 gene likely indicate a disease relevant mutation in the nearby region and warrant further LD mapping in larger cohorts.  4.

CCL gene SNP markers in SLE None but one of the tested markers showed association with SLE. The associations of PG28 (1641 bp from 3?

Among the markers defining this haplotype only PG29 (rs16971802) is a non-synonymous mutation. The current marker selection only allows a partial evaluation of LD in this region, but our preceding analyses with evenly distributed 232 markers in 17q11.2–q12 showed a large LD block encompassing CCL14–CCL15–CCL23–CCL18–CCL3–CCL4 ( Vyshkina et al., 2005 ). PG28–PG32 are located in this extensive LD block suggesting that a lupus relevant mutation may lie within or in the proximity of this haplotype, possibly within the CCL14 gene itself. CCL14 (HCC-2) was characterized at DNA, mRNA and protein levels only recently ( Pardigol et al., 1998 ), and its involvement in human diseases is still being explored. CCL14 binds to multiple CC chemokine receptors (CCR) including CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5 (this latter is a HIV-1 co-receptor). It may have functional significance in inhibiting HIV entry into CCR5 expressing cells ( Blain et al., 2007 ) and controlling allergic airway inflammation and growth of cancer ( Gupta et al., 2008 ). CCL14 has never been implicated in MS, and this is the first time when an association was detected in this region with SLE. However, a polymorphism in CCR5 was associated with SLE ( Mamtani et al., 2007 ), which further supports a potential role for the CCL14–CCR5 axis in lupus. CCL14 may represent one of the susceptibility genes in the 17p12–q11 region that has been considered a susceptibility locus in SLE ( Johansson et al., 2004 ). In summary, identification of non-HLA susceptibility markers in MS is hampered by their small effects and a genetic heterogeneity of the disease underscored by recent studies in very large cohorts ( Gregory et al., 2007 ; IMSGC, 2007 ; Lundmark et al., 2007 ). In the present follow up study, we excluded a major importance of CCL variants in MS. However, the increased frequency of the PG19–PG22–PG23 C–G–C haplotype (CCL8) in the severe and its decreased frequency in the mild subgroup of MS is a new finding which may have functional relevance and merit further evaluation. The associations of SLE with a SNP marker and haplotype in the CCL14 gene likely indicate a disease relevant mutation in the nearby region and warrant further LD mapping in larger cohorts.  4.3. Findings in SLE 4.3.1. CCL gene SNP markers in SLE None but one of the tested markers showed association with SLE. The associations of PG28 (1641 bp from 3?
