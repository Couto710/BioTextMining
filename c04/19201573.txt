Three-Dimensional Echocardiographic Assessment of Acquired Left Ventricular to Right Atrial Shunt (Gerbode Defect) A 60-year-old man was readmitted 1 year after bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement for recurrent endocarditis. Transthoracic 2-dimensional color Doppler revealed a novel finding of a left-to-right shunt from the left ventricular outflow tract to the right atrium immediately superior to the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve consistent with an acquired Gerbode defect. Real-time 3-dimensional echocardiography was used to accurately delineate the course of the shunt. To avoid overestimating right ventricular systolic pressure by mistaking such a shunt for an eccentric jet of tricuspid regurgitation, it is important to accurately differentiate the two. Real-time 3-dimensional echocardiography now provides rapid, detailed 3-dimensional appreciation of the origin and course of such shunts with easy facility of orienting views to the flows of interest by cropping. Such information can help design optimal surgical or catheter-based therapy.
