A Phase II Study of Paclitaxel + Etoposide + Cisplatin + Concurrent Radiation Therapy for Previously Untreated Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (E2596) A Trial of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Introduction To determine the 1-year survival, response rate, and toxicity for patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer treated with the combination of cisplatin plus etoposide plus paclitaxel with delayed concurrent (starting with cycle 3) high dose thoracic radiotherapy. Patients and Methods Patients with previously untreated limited stage small cell lung cancer, Easter Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2 and adequate organ function were eligible. Cycles 1 and 2 of chemotherapy consisted of paclitaxel 170 mg/m2 intravenous day 1, etoposide 80 mg/m2 intravenous days 1 to 3, and cisplatin 60 mg/m2 intravenous day 1 followed by filgrastim 5 ? g/kg subcutaneously days 4 to 13. Cycles 3 and 4 of chemotherapy consisted of a reduced dose of paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 intravenous day 1, and the same dose of etoposide and cisplatin with concurrent thoracic radiation therapy 1.8 Gy in 35 fractions (total 63 Gy) administered over 7 weeks. Results Sixty-three patients were entered, 61 patients were eligible. The most common grade 4 toxicity seen was granulocytopenia (62%). Nonhematologic toxicities included febrile neutropenia in 19% of patients, grade 3 and 4 esophagitis in 32% of patients, and grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in 14% of patients. Two patients suffered lethal toxicities. The overall response rate was 79%. The 1-year survival rate was 64%. The median overall survival was 15.7 months, and the median progression-free survival was 8.6 months. Conclusions The combination of cisplatin plus etoposide plus paclitaxel chemotherapy and concurrent delayed thoracic radiotherapy as administered in this trial provide no apparent advantage with respect to response, local control, or survival compared with historical controls.  Patients and Methods Eligible patients had histologic (or cytologic) proof of SCLC. Patients were clinically staged by radiologic examination of the head, chest, and abdomen as LD. Patients had to have measurable or evaluable disease. Patients had to have adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function as defined as follows: white blood cell count ?4000/mm3, platelets ?100,000/mm3, creatinine ?1.5 mg/dL, and total bilirubin ?1.5 mg/dL, and a forced expiratory volume in 1 second >1 liter. Additional eligibility criteria included age ?18 years and an ECOG PS of 0–2. Patients may not have had prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biologic therapy for lung cancer. Ineligible patients included those with pericardial or pleural effusions with the exception of small effusions seen only on computed tomography scan or effusions appearing after invasive biopsy procedures. Patients with evidence of symptomatic heart disease including angina, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, uncontrolled arrhythmia, or a myocardial infarction within 6 months were also ineligible. Patients had to have been disease-free for ?5 years if they had a history of prior malignancies (except for cured basal or squamous cell skin cancers, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix). Pregnant or lactating women were ineligible. All patients provided written informed consent. Patients received four cycles of PET with delayed concurrent radiation therapy. Specifically, for cycles 1 and 2, patients received paclitaxel 170 mg/m2 intravenous day 1, etoposide 80 mg/m2 intravenous day 1 to 3, and cisplatin 60 mg/m2 intravenous day 2 every 21 days followed by filgrastim 5 ? g/kg subcutaneously on days 4 to 13 or until postnadir white blood cell ?10,000. During cycles 3 and 4 of chemotherapy, patients received paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 intravenous day 1, etoposide 60 mg/m2 intravenous day 1 to 3, and cisplatin 60 mg/m2 intravenous day 2 every 21 days with concurrent TRT. Thoracic radiation began within 24 hours of the start of cycle 3 day 1 (study day 43). Radiation therapy was given with megavoltage therapy, with minimum peak energy of 4 MV with minimum source to isocenter distance of 100 cm. Electron beams, 60Co, and 80 cm SSD treatment were not acceptable. When possible, energies in excess of 15 MV were avoided due to uncertainties in electron buildup but this may not have been possible in those facilities which had only 6 and 20 Mv beams available. All patients underwent simulation on a diagnostic quality unit before beginning chemotherapy. Two target volumes (TV) were used in this treatment regimen. The first, TV1, included the mediastinum from the thoracic inlet to the subcarinal space, ipsilateral hilum, and ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa in cases where there were enlarged (>1.5 cm) upper mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as the prechemotherapy tumor volume with a margin of 1.5 to 2.0 cm. This volume was treated with the initial 45 Gy, in 25 fractions over 5 weeks at 1.8 Gy per fraction. TV2, which was treated for the final 18 Gy, did include only the computed tomography demonstrated tumor volume (primary and nodal) remaining after the initial two cycles of chemotherapy with a 1.5 cm margin. TV2 was used to deliver the final 18 Gy in 10 fractions, over 2 weeks at 1.8 Gy per fraction. The total dose was 63 Gy in 35 fractions at 1.8 Gy per fraction in 7 weeks. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was administered to patients at the discretion of the patient's treating physicians. This study was designed to have 86% power to detect a 15% improvement in the 1-year survival rate, i.e., from 70 to 85%, for a one-sided 0.05-level test. 40 The null hypothesis of 70% survival at 1 year was rejected if we observed at least 45 survivors at 1 year. Confidence intervals for the proportion of patients alive at 1 year and for response rates were estimated using exact binomial confidence intervals. 41 Survival curves were estimated by the method of Kaplan-Meier. 42 The primary end point for this study was the proportion of patients alive at 1 year. Secondary endpoints were objective overall response rate, with response assessed according to the ECOG Solid Tumor Response Criteria, and toxicity. Overall survival was defined as time from registration to death. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as time from registration to tumor progression or death without documented disease progression. Patients alive without progression were censored at the last time known to be in remission or stable. Patients unevaluable for response were censored at time zero. To determine if prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) treatment was associated with the site of relapse/progression (both local and distant) at the time of relapse/progression, two-sided 0.05-level Fisher's exact test tests was performed. Furthermore, a two-sided 0.05-level log-rank test was conducted to determine if a difference in the time to progression in (central nervous system) CNS existed between patients who received PCI and those who did not. All patients who did not develop CNS progression at the time of first relapse/progression were censored at their initial relapse/progression time (if they relapsed/progressed) or at their death date or the last date they were known to be alive. Ineligible patients were excluded from all analyses except for the toxicity analysis.  Results From December 1997 to October 1998, 63 patients were accrued, of which 61 were eligible for enrollment. Two patients were ineligible; one patient had an forced expiratory volume in 1 second level <1.0 liter and another patient was taken off study after cycle 2 because of suspected extensive stage disease. The baseline characteristics of the 61 eligible subjects are described in Table 1 . The median age of patients was 63 years (range 36–84 years); 43% were PS 0 and 57% were PS 1; 26% of the patients had ?5% weight loss in the previous 6 months. Toxicities Toxicity data for all 63 patients are presented in Table 2 . Forty-three patients suffered at least one grade 4 toxicity. Hematologic toxicities were most frequent with grade 4 neutropenia occurring in 62%, grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in 8% and grade 3 anemia in 14% of patients. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 19% of patients. Among the nonhematologic toxicities, grade 3 or 4 esophagitis was seen in 32% of patients and grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in 14% of patients. Two patients suffered treatment-related lethal toxicities; one patient died due to pulmonary failure, and one patient died of treatment-related septic shock. Response Responses were assessed by the individual investigators. The overall response rate was 78.7%, (95% CI: 66.3–88.2%) including 19.7% complete responses. Seven patients had stable disease, four patients had progressive disease, and two patients were unevaluable for response. A summary of the response data is given in Table 3 . Survival The median overall survival was 15.7 months, (2.5–41.4+ months). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the distribution of the overall survival is presented in Figure 1 . Forty-eight of the 61 eligible patients had died. The 1- and 2-year survival were 63.9 and 23.8% respectively. The Median PFS was 8.6 months. The incidence of intrathoracic failure was 24.6%.

Discussion The treatment of limited SCLC has not been favorably impacted upon since the last intergroup study, published almost 10 years ago, reported a median survival of 23 months and a 5-year survival of 26% for the twice-daily radiotherapy arm. 10 Attempts to improve on these results have centered upon two major therapeutic principles—improving systemic control (chemotherapy) and/or improving local control (radiotherapy). Paclitaxel has been shown to have significant activity as a single agent in patients with SCLC in phase II trials, 26 , 27 and the three-drug combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin and etoposide seemed promising in phase II trials conducted in patients with extensive SCLC. 28 , 30 , 31 Radiation oncologists have proposed the concept that if the total dose for once-daily radiotherapy was increased, it could be as effective, or more so, than twice-daily radiotherapy. 25 Given this information, ECOG conducted a phase II study of the three-drug combination of PET with concurrent high dose once daily TRT (63 Gy) in patients with LD-SCLC. Unfortunately, the results were disappointing; with an overall response rate of 78.7% that included only 19.7% complete responses. Importantly, the median survival of 15.7 months and 1- and 2-year survival of 63.9% and 23.8% respectively, do not compare favorably with two prior trials evaluating this regimen ( Table 4 ); one with TRT commencing at cycle 3 of chemotherapy and another at cycle 1. The first study by Bremnes et al., 38 combined paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 intravenous with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 intravenous day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 intravenous day 1 and 100 mg oral twice daily days 2 to 5 for 5 cycles in combination with TRT (42 Gy in 15 fractions starting at cycle 3 of chemotherapy) in 39 patients with LD-SCLC. Overall response rate was 92% and median survival was 21 months. 38 A second study by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group found equally favorable results when they administered paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 intravenous with cisplatin 60 mg/m2 intravenous day 1 and etoposide 60 mg/m2 intravenous day 1 and 80 mg/m2 days 2 and 3 with concurrent twice daily TRT (45 Gy in 30 fractions over 3 weeks starting at cycle 1) to 55 patients with LD-SCLC. Paclitaxel was increased to 175 mg/m2 at cycle 3. 39 The response rate was 92%, median and 1-year survival were 24.7 months and 83% respectively. Similar to these trials we found grade 3 and 4 neutropenia to be the most common hematologic toxicity seen in three quarter of patients. 38 , 39 We had a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia occurring in 19% of patients. Similar to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial, 39 grade 3 and 4 esophagitis was the most common nonhemtaologic toxicity occurring in approximately one-third of patients. There are several potential reasons for the discouraging results seen in our study. Inferior local control is one such possibility perhaps due to the use of the postinduction radiation port for the final 18 Gy or the “delayed” concurrent radiotherapy that was employed starting with the third cycle of chemotherapy. Several reports suggest early initiation of TRT, within 4 to 6 weeks of chemotherapy, may be beneficial. 43 , 44 However, the overall local failure rate for patients was 24.8%. This includes those patients who failed solely within the radiation port, 16.4%, with an additional 8.4% of patients who failed either within or outside the radiation field. This is comparable to the local failure pattern of both arms of the intergroup study in which the radiotherapy was given concurrent with the first cycle of chemotherapy. 10 In this study, the overall failure rate was 52% for the once daily arm and 36% for the twice-daily arm. Therefore, given the low incidence of local failure seen in this trial it is difficult to support this premise for the poor outcome seen in this trial. The lack of adequate systemic control is another possibility. This may in part be due to the need for reduced chemotherapy doses given with TRT in cycles 3 and 4 due to the inability to use filgrastim with concurrent TRT. Although the cisplatin dose remained the same, the dose of etoposide was decreased by one-third to accommodate paclitaxel. Additionally, the initial enthusiasm for the addition of paclitaxel to cisplatin and etoposide has waned considerably given the results of two recently completed randomized trials comparing PE with PET in patients with previously untreated extensive SCLC. 33 , 45 The results of these trials failed to reveal any improvement in survival for patients treated with PET chemotherapy. One trial demonstrated increased lethal toxicities for patients receiving PET. Age ?70 was found to be a factor predisposing patients to increased toxicity. 45 Another contributing factor could be the high incidence of CNS only failures seen in this trial. The use of PCI was not mandated in this trial. Eleven patients (18.6%) suffered with CNS only relapse. In this trial the majority of patients, 66%, did not receive PCI. PCI imparts a modest survival advantage for the patients with SCLC who achieve a CR after combined modality therapy. 14 Given the disappointing results of our trial we conclude that the combination of PET chemotherapy with delayed concurrent TRT does not represent an improvement over the current standard therapy for PE and early concurrent thoracic radiotherapy. Future directions will include evaluating other active chemotherapy agents, unique dosing schedules of radiotherapy, and molecularly targeted therapy.
