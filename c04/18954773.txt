Nationwide Survey of Alcohol Screening and Brief Intervention Practices at US Level I Trauma Centers BACKGROUND In 2007, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Committee on Trauma implemented a requirement that Level I trauma centers must have a mechanism to identify patients who are problem drinkers and the capacity to provide an intervention for patients who screen positive. Although the landmark alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) mandate is anticipated to impact trauma practice nationwide, a literature review revealed no studies that have systematically documented SBI practice pre-ACS requirement. STUDY DESIGN Trauma programs at all US Level I trauma centers were contacted and asked to complete a survey about pre-ACS requirement trauma center SBI practice. RESULTS One hundred forty-eight of 204 (73%) Level I trauma centers responded to the survey. More than 70% of responding centers routinely used laboratory tests (eg, blood alcohol concentration) to screen patients for alcohol and 39% routinely used a screening question or standardized screening instrument. Screen-positive patients received a formal alcohol consult or had an informal alcohol discussion with staff members approximately 25% of the time. CONCLUSIONS The investigation observed marked variability across Level I centers in the percentage of patients screened and in the nature and extent of intervention delivery in screen-positive patients. In the wake of the ACS Committee on Trauma requirement, future research could systematically implement and evaluate training in the delivery of evidence-based alcohol interventions and training in development of trauma center organizational capacity for sustained delivery of SBI.  METHODS Identification and characterization of US Level I trauma centers All Level I trauma centers in the US were identified through review of the ACS listing of verified trauma programs, the American Trauma Society’s Information Exchange information system, and other Web-based searches. 33 Informational data on hospital accreditation, academic affiliation, and bed number were obtained from American Hospital Directory listings and through review of individual hospital Web pages. These public information data sources were used in conjunction with hospital Web sites to identify potential trauma program survey responders. Because the survey aimed to assess alcohol practices at the organizational level, trauma center staff, such as trauma program coordinators and front-line practitioners involved in day-to-day alcohol screening and intervention procedures, were identified for contact. After providing informed consent, trauma program staff had the option of completing Web-based, hardcopy, or telephone interview questionnaires. Providers were reimbursed $20 after completion of the questionnaire. The University of Washington Institutional Review Board approved all study procedures before protocol implementation. Development of the Disseminating Organizational Screening and Brief Intervention Services at Trauma Centers Alcohol Practices Questionnaire A questionnaire was developed to assess pre-ACS mandate Level I trauma center alcohol SBI practices. Selected items were adapted from an instrument previously used to assess emergency department SBI practices in the state of Connecticut. 34 Additional items were developed to capture current contextual factors in the delivery of trauma center SBI ( Appendix ). The initial two items assessed respondent familiarity with the ACS mandate and knowledge of the trauma program’s alcohol SBI services. Two items assessed recent trauma program changes in SBI delivery in the past 6 months and any earlier SBI training experiences. A series of four items then assessed trauma center alcohol SBI practices. Respondents were queried as to whether they used laboratory tests or screening questionnaires. If respondents answered yes, then subsequent items determined which laboratory tests (eg, BAC) or screening questionnaires (Michigan Alcohol Screening Test [MAST], Alcohol use Indentification Test [AUDIT], CAGE [questionnaire-related acronym], TWEAK [questionnaire-related acronym]) were used. Items assessing the percentage of injured patients screened with each method were also included. Next, four items assessed alcohol intervention and referral practices for screen-positive patients. Respondents were asked what typically happens in screen-positive patients (eg, formal alcohol consult, informal discussion, nothing). Questionnaire items also identified which type of staff person responded to alcohol consults. Providers were asked if any of the following were typically included in an alcohol consult at their trauma center: Additional assessment of psychosocial issues Evidence-based bedside counseling techniques, such as motivational interviewing Treatment referral for specialized alcohol services Later items asked about hospital salary support for alcohol SBI services. Final questions assessed the background of the respondent (eg, position and years at the trauma center, professional degree). Data analyses We first examined the frequencies and distributions of organizational characteristics for all 204 US Level I trauma centers. Next, we used chi-square, t -tests, and Fisher’s exact test statistics to compare the characteristics of responding and nonresponding sites. We then examined the frequencies and distributions of survey items. Review of the literature and ACS/COT alcohol SBI requirements informed selection of six items as SBI practice quality indicators: Routine performance of an alcohol laboratory test screen Routine questionnaire screening for alcohol problems Routinely requested consult for screen-positive patients Additional assessment of psychosocial issues as part of an alcohol consult Evidence-based bedside counseling as part of an alcohol consult Treatment referral for specialized alcohol services as part of an alcohol consult We used chi-square, t -test, and Fisher’s exact test statistics to compare the organizational characteristics of centers that endorsed with those that did not endorse SBI quality indicators. Generic trauma center organizational characteristics assessed included ACS verification, geographic location (region of the county and rural status), teaching status (teaching hospital status, membership in council of teaching hospitals, number of interns/residents), population served (adult, pediatric, or combined), and number of hospital beds and injury admissions per year. Alcohol SBI-related organizational characteristics assessed included whether or not the trauma center had committed staff salary support for SBI, specialized SBI training, or changes to SBI service delivery in the past 6 months. Organizational characteristics positively associated with SBI quality indicators at the p < 0.05 level are reported. When 2 or more organizational characteristics were significantly associated with SBI characteristics, logistic regression with simultaneous entry of variables significant at the p < 0.05 level was used to assess for significant independent associations.

RESULTS Of 204 Level I centers identified, staff at 8 sites refused participation and staff at 57 sites did not respond, leaving 148 (73%) survey participants. Responding centers did not differ substantially from nonresponding centers with regard to ACS accreditation status, region of the country or rural status, population served, university affiliation, or volume of hospital beds. Responding trauma centers, on average, had more interns and residents (responder mean 252, SD 168, versus nonresponder mean 143, SD 202; t(223) = 4.3; p < 0.001). Median number of contacts required before response was 4 (range 1 to 10). Trauma centers responded to the survey between June 14, 2006, and November 6, 2007, with > 95% of responses occurring before spring 2007. Approximately 50% of responding sites were ACS-accredited ( Table 1 ). Eighty-eight percent of responding centers were from major metropolitan areas and only 12% from rural areas. More than three-quarters of trauma centers were teaching hospitals with university affiliations. Average number of hospital beds was 568 (SD 220), and on average Level I trauma centers reported admitting 2087 (SD 1,284) injured patients per year. The majority of trauma center survey respondents were nurses ( Table 2 ).On average, responders had > 10 years of work experience at the trauma center. Approximately 75% of responders rated themselves as “extremely knowledgeable” or “very knowledgeable” about their trauma centers’ SBI services ( Table 3 ). Fewer than 50% rated themselves as “extremely knowledgeable” or “very knowledgeable” about the ACS/COT alcohol SBI requirements. With regard to screening practices, > 70% of sites were using laboratory screening methods, and 39% of sites endorsed regularly asking a screening question ( Table 3 ). Thirty-four percent of responders endorsed using both laboratory tests and questionnaire items, 45% reported using only one screening modality, and 21% used neither. At 70% of the sites that endorsed BAC administration, not all injured patients were screened. Median number of patients screened with laboratory tests was 56%, with approximately 40% of sites screening > 75% of patients and 20% of sites screening < 10% of patients. Also, at the 39% of sites where questionnaire items were used, the median number of patients administered questionnaires was 41%, with approximately 30% of sites screening > 75% of patients and 40% of sites screening < 10% of patients. With regard to intervention for screen-positive patients, approximately one-fourth of trauma centers endorsed requesting a formal alcohol consult ( Table 3 ). A wide range of providers were involved in alcohol evaluation and interventions, including social workers, nurses, psychiatrists, chemical dependency counselors, psychologists, and resident and attending surgeons. More than 60% of sites endorsed additional assessment and referral of screen-positive patients; these activities were reported to occur in > 75% of screen-positive patients. More than 40% of sites reported delivering evidence-based bedside counseling techniques, such as brief negotiated interventions or motivational interviewing interventions, or both. Fewer than one-third of sites committed trauma center funding specifically for SBI services. SBI-related organizational characteristics were more likely to impact SBI quality indicators compared with generic trauma center organizational characteristics. In bivariate comparisons, trauma center funding for SBI was associated with routinely performing alcohol laboratory testing, routinely asking screening questions, and performing evidence-based bedside interventions. Changes in the past 6 months to SBI services were associated with routinely performing a laboratory test, routinely asking screening questions, request of a formal alcohol consult for screen-positive patients, and performing evidence-based bedside interventions. Having undergone specialized training was associated with routinely performing a laboratory test and routinely asking screening questions. University affiliation was associated with requesting a formal alcohol consult when patients screened positive. The only quality indicator for which ACS accreditation was substantially associated was the additional assessment of psychosocial issues when alcohol consultation occurs. In logistic regression analyses, changes to SBI service delivery in the past 6 months remained significantly associated with formal alcohol consultation for screen-positive patients (odds ratio [OR]: 3.45; 95% CI, 1.41 to 8.49) and delivery of evidence-based interventions (OR: 4.06; 95% CI, 1.17 to 14.09). Trauma center funding for SBI remained significantly associated with delivery of evidence-based bedside interventions (OR: 6.78; 95% CI, 1.66 to 27.73). None of the generic trauma center organizational characteristics remained significantly associated with SBI quality indicators in the logistic regression analyses.

DISCUSSION This is the first investigation to assess alcohol SBI practices for nearly all Level I trauma centers in the US. The vast majority of sites were surveyed before widespread knowledge of the new ACS/COT alcohol SBI requirements. To our knowledge, no sites had yet undergone verification site visits that included the new SBI criteria. Also, 75% of survey respondents rated themselves as very or extremely knowledgeable about their trauma center’s alcohol program. Results can be taken to represent nationwide pre-ACS mandate alcohol SBI practices. Findings of the investigation add to a growing body of literature on alcohol SBI at trauma centers. Earlier reports have surveyed trauma providers about alcohol SBI beliefs and practices, 29 , 30 examined obstacles to widespread implementation of SBI procedures, 35 – 37 and described SBI guidelines and procedures. 32 , 38 – 41 The current study builds on and extends these earlier reports by describing the current status of alcohol SBI practices at the trauma center organizational level nationwide. More than 70% of sites appear to be using laboratory tests to screen for alcohol, making this the primary method of alcohol screening currently in use. Approximately 40% of sites were screening with one or more single alcohol items or questionnaires. A number of questionnaires were being used for screening, including the CAGE, AUDIT, and MAST. This survey documented that patients who screened positive received a variety of services, ranging from one episode of bedside counseling to a referral for counseling by an alcohol treatment specialist. Marked variability was observed in the frequency and type of service provided, with only 40% of patients receiving counseling techniques that are evidence based and that have proved effectiveness with injured patients. This study indicates that before the ACS/COT mandate, administration of evidence based alcohol interventions in trauma centers has not been routine. The current investigation also represents an initial attempt to define alcohol SBI quality indicators and to describe the association between organizational characteristics and quality indicators. Alcohol SBI-related organizational characteristics, such as trauma center salary support for alcohol SBI providers and recent modifications in SBI service delivery, were the variables most strongly associated with routine screening and higher-quality intervention activities, such as formal alcohol consults and delivery of evidence-based alcohol interventions. A key observation was that generic trauma center organizational characteristics, such as admission volume, region of the country, ACS verification status, and teaching hospital status, were not independently associated with alcohol SBI practices. Instead, SBI-related organizational characteristics, such as recent training or service changes or the assignment of funding for alcohol screening, were associated with higher-quality alcohol SBI practices. Future investigations might productively assess the impact of organizational-level interventions on SBI quality indicators. This investigation has several limitations. Inferences derived from the study are limited by the 73% survey response rate. This limitation is mitigated in part by the observation that for the vast majority of organizational characteristics, responding trauma centers did not substantially differ from nonresponding trauma centers. Also, heterogeneity in responder background and trauma program knowledge could contribute to variability in the accuracy of responses across Level I sites. Many responses relied exclusively on respondent self-report without collateral assessments, such as site visit, chart review, or trauma registry confirmatory data. Finally, a key survey omission was information on screening and intervention services for use of illicit drugs. Beyond these limitations, we believe the investigative findings have important implications for alcohol SBI practice and policy. The investigation, for the first time, documents nationwide alcohol SBI practices before implementation of the ACS/COT mandate. We observed marked variability across Level I trauma centers in the percentage of patients screened and in the nature and extent of intervention delivery in screen-positive patients. Although the ACS mandate is a remarkable first step, the findings are consistent with earlier surveys that suggest policy requirements might not directly translate into widespread implementation of high-quality, evidence-based SBI procedures. A study by Degutis, 34 which evaluated an earlier statewide trauma center SBI mandate in the state of Connecticut, met with mixed success, which suggests that policy initiatives alone might not result in delivery of high-quality SBI services in the absence of adequate training and support. Organizational behavior research 42 , 43 provides a model for trauma center adoption, implementation, and integration of SBI services. Just as there are instruments to measure an individual’s readiness for behavioral change, 44 organizational psychologists have articulated a program readiness-for-change model that can guide the integration of SBI services into routine trauma center practice. 42 , 43 In summary, this investigation documents baseline alcohol SBI practices at US Level I trauma centers before extensive ACS/COT mandate-related changes had occurred. The investigation observed marked variability across Level I trauma centers in the percentage of patients screened for alcohol and in the nature and extent of intervention delivery in screen-positive patients. In the wake of the ACS/COT requirement, future research could systematically implement and evaluate training in the delivery of evidence-based alcohol interventions and training in the development of trauma center organizational capacity for the sustained delivery of alcohol SBI.
