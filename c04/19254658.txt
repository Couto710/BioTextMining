The benefits and risks of ultraviolet (UV) tanning and its alternatives: the role of prudent sun exposure Synopsis Sunlight and indoor ultraviolet (UV) induced tanning is a common behavior, especially among adolescents, young adults, and individuals with lighter skin. Excessive sun exposure is associated with several health risks including the acceleration of skin aging and the promotion of skin cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma. However, several health benefits of UV exposure include vitamin D production and improved mood. Herein, we analyze these health risks and benefits. We further discuss pertinent issues surrounding indoor tanning, the role of sunless tanning products, and prudent sun exposure.  Summary/Conclusion Sun exposure is beneficial in moderation, but can be harmful in excess. Sun exposure guidance should be tailored to the individual patient. Individual factors such as skin type, past history of skin cancers, and concurrent medical conditions should influence counseling practices. Tanning is primarily achieved through the overexposure of skin to UV radiation and is most prevalent among lighter skinned populations. In these populations, UV tanning may not offer any benefit over moderate sun exposure to offset elevated skin cancer and photoaging risk. Sun exposure should not be used as an alternative but as an adjunct to a diet fortified with vitamin D. Sunless tanning products may serve as a sensible, safer alternative for those who desire tanned skin. The use of sunscreens, preferably with broad coverage against UVA, UVB, and infrared radiation, are essential for tanners who have prolonged UV and sunlight exposure. However, tanners should be educated that while sunscreens prevent sunburn and reduce the risk of squamous cell carcinoma [ 68 ], they do not seem to reduce the risk for the development of basal cell carcinoma [ 68 ] or melanoma [ 69 ]. Therefore, prudent sun exposure is paramount.
