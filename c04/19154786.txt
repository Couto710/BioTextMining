Reduced amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid ?-protein precursor by the small-molecule Differentiation Inducing Factor-1 The detection of cell cycle proteins in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) brains may represent an early event leading to neurodegeneration. To identify cell cycle modifiers with anti-A? properties, we assessed the effect of Differentiation-Inducing Factor-1 (DIF-1), a unique, small-molecule from Dictyostelium discoideum , on the proteolysis of the amyloid ?-protein precursor (APP) in a variety of different cell types. We show that DIF-1 slows cell cycle progression through G0/G1 that correlates with a reduction in cyclin D1 protein levels. Western blot analysis of DIF-treated cells and conditioned medium revealed decreases in the levels of secreted APP, mature APP, and C-terminal fragments. Assessment of conditioned media by sandwich ELISA showed reduced levels of A?40 and A?42, also demonstrating that treatment with DIF-1 effectively decreases the ratio of A?42 to A?40. In addition, DIF-1 significantly diminished APP phosphorylation at residue T668. Interestingly, site-directed mutagenesis of APP residue Thr668 to alanine or glutamic acid abolished the effect of DIF-1 on APP proteolysis and restored secreted levels of A?. Finally, DIF-1 prevented the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments induced by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, and calpain inhibitor N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN). Our findings suggest that DIF-1 affects G0/G1-associated amyloidogenic processing of APP by a ?-secretase-, proteasome- and calpain-insensitive pathway, and that this effect requires the presence of residue Thr668.
