DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION IN CLEAR CELL RENAL CELL CARCINOMA IDENTIFIED BY GENE EXPRESSION PROFILING Objective Gene expression profiling has been shown to provide prognostic information regarding patients with a solitary, sporadic RCC. There is no reliable way to differentiate synchronous renal metastases from bilateral primary tumors in patients with bilateral RCC. We present data using a custom kidney cancer cDNA array that can predict outcomes in patients with unilateral and bilateral RCC. Methods Fresh frozen tissue from 38 clear cell RCC (cRCC) was analyzed using a cancer cDNA array containing 3966 genes relevant to cancer or kidney development. Median follow-up was 5.3 years; cancer had recurred in 12 (43%) patients and 11 (39%) patients were deceased at last follow-up. Results Using a training dataset of 8 tumors, a 44-gene expression profile (GEP) distinguishing aggressive and indolent cRCC was identified. Of 29 single cRCC, 16 were predicted to be indolent and 13 aggressive by GEP. Recurrence-free survival at 5 years was 68% and 42% in these 2 groups (P=.032). cRCC classified as indolent or aggressive according to SSIGN score had 5-year recurrence-free survival of 78% and 42%, respectively (P=.021). In a cox proportional hazards analysis, GEP was not an independent predictor of recurrence-free survival after accounting for SSIGN score. GEP classification correlated with cancer-specific survival at 5 years in 4 of 4 patients with metachronous cRCC, but only 2 of 4 patients with bilateral synchronous cRCC. Conclusions GEP using a kidney cancer-relevant cDNA array can differentiate between aggressive and indolent cRCC. GEP results may be most useful in unilateral cRCC when results are discordant with predictions of tumor behavior based on standard clinicopathologic features. In addition, GEP can provide prognostic information that may help characterize tumors of unknown clinical stage, such as bilateral metachronous cRCC.  Introduction Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogeneous entity as classified genetically, histologically, and clinically. Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is the most common histologic subtype, accounting for about 70% of all RCCs. Compared with the less common papillary and chromophobe subtypes, ccRCC is also the most lethal, with up to 40% of patients dying of metastatic disease. Several clinical algorithms currently exist to predict the risk of disease progression in patients with RCC. 1 – 3 Gene expression profiling is a high-throughput means to assess the molecular phenotype of cancers. Several groups have used commercial microarray analyses, such as Affymetrix™, to characterize the genes expressed by the major renal epithelial neoplasms (cRCC, papillary RCC, chromophobe RCC, and oncocytoma) and to predict clinical outcomes in these patients. 4 – 10 In combination with patient and tumor characteristics, molecular data has recently been shown to improve upon the accuracy of the RCC predictive algorithms that are currently available for patients with a single tumor. 11 , 12 For patients with bilateral synchronous or metachronous cRCC, there is currently no reliable way to differentiate renal metastases from multiple primary tumors. Clinical history and histologic features of the tumors can suggest the biologic potential of these tumors, but the exact clinical stage is unknown in the absence of nodal or distant metastases. Information regarding the likely clinical aggressiveness of these tumors can enable clinicians to better manage these situations, in which systemic treatment could be given if recurrence is likely. We have identified a set of 44 cancer- and kidney-specific genes that are differentially-expressed in aggressive and indolent cRCC. We have used this gene expression profile (GEP) to predict the clinical outcomes in 29 patients with unilateral cRCC and 9 patients with bilateral or metastatic cRCC.  Methods Fresh frozen tissue from 38 clear cell RCC (cRCC) was analyzed using a cancer cDNA array containing 3966 genes relevant to cancer or kidney development. Median follow-up was 5.3 years; cancer had recurred in 12 (43%) patients and 11 (39%) patients were deceased at last follow-up.  Results Using a training dataset of 8 tumors, a 44-gene expression profile (GEP) distinguishing aggressive and indolent cRCC was identified. Of 29 single cRCC, 16 were predicted to be indolent and 13 aggressive by GEP. Recurrence-free survival at 5 years was 68% and 42% in these 2 groups (P=.032). cRCC classified as indolent or aggressive according to SSIGN score had 5-year recurrence-free survival of 78% and 42%, respectively (P=.021). In a cox proportional hazards analysis, GEP was not an independent predictor of recurrence-free survival after accounting for SSIGN score. GEP classification correlated with cancer-specific survival at 5 years in 4 of 4 patients with metachronous cRCC, but only 2 of 4 patients with bilateral synchronous cRCC.  Conclusions GEP using a kidney cancer-relevant cDNA array can differentiate between aggressive and indolent cRCC. GEP results may be most useful in unilateral cRCC when results are discordant with predictions of tumor behavior based on standard clinicopathologic features. In addition, GEP can provide prognostic information that may help characterize tumors of unknown clinical stage, such as bilateral metachronous cRCC.  Materials and Methods Clinical information regarding patients Thirty-eight specimens were collected from patients undergoing partial or radical nephrectomy between 1999 and 2001 at Cleveland Clinic under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. Clinical, pathologic, and follow-up data regarding all patients was obtained from review of the medical record and contact with patients or surviving family members as a part of an IRB-approved kidney cancer registry. All-cause mortality was assessed using the Social Security Death Index. 13 Sample preparation and analysis of gene expression profile Total RNA (5 ?g) was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Whole-cell extracts were prepared after 2 washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 as the detergent, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, and pepstatin). Pooled RNA from 13- to 24-week-old human fetal kidneys (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as a common reference in the cDNA array experiments. GeneSpring software (Silicongenetics, Redwood City, CA) was used for data analyses. Intensities below 100 were raised to 100 and nonlinear normalization (LOESS) was done for each array to determine the abundance of each transcript in a tumor sample as a fold change with respect to its abundance in the human fetal kidney sample (common reference). Cancer cDNA array construction The GEP of cRCC was analyzed using a cancer cDNA array that contained 2 probes for each of 4608 unigenes or unclustered expressed sequence tags corresponding to 9216 cDNA clones. 14 Excluding internal controls, 3966 genes relevant to cancer or kidney development were analyzed including: (a) 1800 genes implicated in cancer progression or metastasis 15 , 16 and Affymetrix™ cancer G110 array ( http:www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx ); (b) 1809 genes involved in kidney development ( http://golgi.ana.ed.ac.uk/kidhome.html ); (c) 1400 potential downstream targets of p53 transcriptional regulation; (d) 950 genes with AU-rich elements in their 3? and/or 5? untranslated region 17 ; (e) 1245 cytokine responsive genes, genes for zinc finger proteins, or genes implicated in apoptosis. Construction of the array was described previously. 14 , 17 Array data extraction and normalization For each gene, the expression signal for each tumor sample and its background, as well as the signal of the reference and its background, were available. The expression of each gene was background corrected by subtraction, and those with low intensities were adjusted by adding a small quantity (100). Expression of each array was then normalized by locally (at the print tip level) weighted polynomial regression (local LOESS) on the base 2 logarithm of the ratio of the intensity of sample over reference. The logarithm (M) was averaged over the 2 spots of each gene and the mean was used for subsequent analysis using statistical software R (Version 2.4). A total of 41 cDNA arrays from 38 cRCC specimens were used in the study, including 3 replicates of one sample and 2 replicates from another. The study plan was to identify genes that best discriminated between 4 indolent and 4 aggressive cRCC that were selected based on near certainty of clinical classification status and without knowledge of specific gene expression, and then use these genes to classify the samples. Statistical analysis Supervised classification was performed using a classification and regression trees (CART) based program, RandomForest using statistical software R. 1,000,000 trees were built to discriminate the 8 tumors, and the frequency of use of each gene was ranked (as votes), resulting in a gene list based on importance. Each tree was constructed using a random sample of the 3966 genes and the importance identified from the error rate of genes not selected in the random sample, i.e., each tree is based on its own training set and test set. Genes with >1.5-fold difference in expression between aggressive and indolent cRCC were used in an unsupervised classification of the testing dataset; heatmaps were created based on 2,500,000 trees constructed during the classification of the 29 tumors. Kaplan-Meier curves were made according to tumor classification by GEP prediction with and without clinical prediction according to SSIGN score. Statistical significance (p<0.05) was determined using the Wilcoxon test. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival using GEP prediction as a binary variable and SSIGN score as a continuous variable.

Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival using GEP prediction as a binary variable and SSIGN score as a continuous variable.  Results Clinical information regarding the 29 patients with single renal tumors is listed in Table 1 . Nineteen patients (66%) were male and 6 (21%) had decreased performance status; median age at surgery was 58 years (interquartile range: 48–68). Median tumor size was 6.0 cm (3.3–8.0) and 38% were incidentally-detected. Surgery was partial (34%) or radical (66%) nephrectomy; adrenalectomy, regional lymphadenectomy, and/or vena caval thrombectomy were performed in selected cases. Pathologic tumor stage was T1 (n=10), T2 (n=8), or ?T3 (n=11). Two patients (6%) had lymph node metastases and 5 (15%) had distant metastases. Thirteen deaths (45%) and 12 cancer recurrences (41%) were detected following nephrectomy; median follow-up in living patients was 5.3 years (5.2–5.5). Microarray analysis was performed on each kidney tumor using a custom cDNA array that included 3966 genes relevant to cancer or kidney development. A training dataset of 8 cRCC with near-certain classification status was used to generate a GEP that distinguished between indolent and aggressive cRCC. The 4 indolent tumors (C03, C07, C37, C51) were pT1 tumors that were <5.5 cm in size and had not recurred during at least 5 years of follow-up. The 4 aggressive tumors (C30, C39, C47, C56) were ?6 cm in size and presented with metastatic disease. A total of 2,500,000 RandomForest constructs was utilized to generate a ranked list of the differentially-expressed genes in the indolent and aggressive cRCC’s. Supervised classification generated a list of 44 genes with an average difference in expression between indolent and aggressive cRCC of at least 1.5-fold ( Table 2 ). The resulting GEP was able to distinguish indolent cRCC from aggressive cRCC ( Figure 1A ). Also shown as an indication of the reproducibility of the microarray experiments is the tight clustering of the GEP from 3 replicates from tumor C86 and the 2 replicates from tumor C03 ( Figure 1B ). The 24 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated genes in the aggressive RCC group were then used to classify the remaining unilateral cRCC (testing dataset). A dendrogram showing the GEP of each of the 29 cRCC reveals 16 indolent cRCC and 13 aggressive cRCC ( Figure 1C ). In order to determine whether the predicted clinical behavior of cRCC was accurately predicted by the GEP, Kaplan-Meier curves depicting the cumulative recurrence-free survival (RFS) were constructed for tumors categorized as indolent or aggressive based on GEP ( Figure 2A ). The estimated cumulative probability of RFS at 5 years for cRCC predicted to be indolent or aggressive based solely on molecular prediction was 67% (95% CI: (47%, 96%) and 44% (95% CI: (23%, 83%)) respectively (P=0.032) ( Table 4 ). Predicted RFS was also assigned to each patient using the SSIGN score, a predictive algorithm based solely on standard clinicopathologic features of cRCC ( Table 1 ). 3 SSIGN was used because it is the only algorithm that includes patients with localized and metastatic cRCC. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to compare patients with tumors predicted to be indolent or aggressive based on SSIGN score, using a cut-off of 3 points that corresponds to a predicted 5-year RFS of 87.8% ( Figure 2B ). The estimated 5-year cumulative probability of RFS was 78% (95% CI: 55%, 100%) or 42% (95% CI: 24%, 74%) for cRCC predicted to be indolent or aggressive cRCC based solely on SSIGN score (P=0.021). Combination of the GEP prediction with the SSIGN prediction allowed for discrimination of tumors into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups ( Figure 2C , P=0.017). Tumors predicted to be indolent by both GEP and SSIGN (low risk), aggressive by either GEP or SSIGN (moderate risk), or aggressive by both GEP and SSIGN (high risk) were associated with an estimated 5-year cumulative probability of RFS of 75% (95% CI: 50, 100%), 63% (95% CI: 38%, 100%) and 34% (95% CI: 13%, 80%), respectively. In a Cox proportional hazards model of RFS, GEP was associated with a hazard ratio of 2.9 (95% CI: 0.89, 9.2, P=0.07). However, GEP was not an independent predictor of RFS (P=0.6) after accounting for SSIGN score as a continuous variable (HR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2 –2.1, P=0.0006). Neither SSIGN score (P=0.5) nor GEP (P=0.4) was a predictor of overall survival. Clinical information regarding 4 patients with metachronous renal cRCC, 4 patients with bilateral synchronous cRCC, and 1 patient with metastatic cRCC is summarized in Table 3 . In these more complex clinical situations, GEP data were analyzed in order to determine whether they could aid in predicting outcomes in these patients with uncertain pathologic stage and disease course. The molecular prediction of clinical behavior was accurate for all 4 patients (100%) with metachronous cRCC; including 1 with GEP-aggressive cRCC that died with cancer recurrence and 3 with GEP-indolent cRCC that are alive at last-follow-up, 2 recurrence-free and 1 alive 7.9 years after the most recent of 4 surgeries for recurrent RCC ( Table 3 ). GEP prediction correlated with clinical outcome in 2 of 4 patients (50%) with synchronous tumors; 2 patients with GEP-indolent tumors were alive and recurrence-free at more than 5 years of follow-up. A third patient was alive and without recurrence almost 7 years after bilateral partial nephrectomies despite having a GEP-aggressive cRCC. The fourth patient with bilateral synchronous cRCC and a GEP-indolent tumor died with metastatic cRCC, most likely related to a contralateral pT3b cRCC which was not available for GEP analysis. Finally, GEP analysis of a cRCC bone metastasis predicted an indolent clinical course in a patient alive 6.7 years after presentation with metastatic cRCC.  Results Clinical information regarding the 29 patients with single renal tumors is listed in Table 1 . Nineteen patients (66%) were male and 6 (21%) had decreased performance status; median age at surgery was 58 years (interquartile range: 48–68). Median tumor size was 6.0 cm (3.3–8.0) and 38% were incidentally-detected.

Pathologic tumor stage was T1 (n=10), T2 (n=8), or ?T3 (n=11). Two patients (6%) had lymph node metastases and 5 (15%) had distant metastases. Thirteen deaths (45%) and 12 cancer recurrences (41%) were detected following nephrectomy; median follow-up in living patients was 5.3 years (5.2–5.5). Microarray analysis was performed on each kidney tumor using a custom cDNA array that included 3966 genes relevant to cancer or kidney development. A training dataset of 8 cRCC with near-certain classification status was used to generate a GEP that distinguished between indolent and aggressive cRCC. The 4 indolent tumors (C03, C07, C37, C51) were pT1 tumors that were <5.5 cm in size and had not recurred during at least 5 years of follow-up. The 4 aggressive tumors (C30, C39, C47, C56) were ?6 cm in size and presented with metastatic disease. A total of 2,500,000 RandomForest constructs was utilized to generate a ranked list of the differentially-expressed genes in the indolent and aggressive cRCC’s. Supervised classification generated a list of 44 genes with an average difference in expression between indolent and aggressive cRCC of at least 1.5-fold ( Table 2 ). The resulting GEP was able to distinguish indolent cRCC from aggressive cRCC ( Figure 1A ). Also shown as an indication of the reproducibility of the microarray experiments is the tight clustering of the GEP from 3 replicates from tumor C86 and the 2 replicates from tumor C03 ( Figure 1B ).

Clinical information regarding 4 patients with metachronous renal cRCC, 4 patients with bilateral synchronous cRCC, and 1 patient with metastatic cRCC is summarized in Table 3 . In these more complex clinical situations, GEP data were analyzed in order to determine whether they could aid in predicting outcomes in these patients with uncertain pathologic stage and disease course. The molecular prediction of clinical behavior was accurate for all 4 patients (100%) with metachronous cRCC; including 1 with GEP-aggressive cRCC that died with cancer recurrence and 3 with GEP-indolent cRCC that are alive at last-follow-up, 2 recurrence-free and 1 alive 7.9 years after the most recent of 4 surgeries for recurrent RCC ( Table 3 ). GEP prediction correlated with clinical outcome in 2 of 4 patients (50%) with synchronous tumors; 2 patients with GEP-indolent tumors were alive and recurrence-free at more than 5 years of follow-up. A third patient was alive and without recurrence almost 7 years after bilateral partial nephrectomies despite having a GEP-aggressive cRCC. The fourth patient with bilateral synchronous cRCC and a GEP-indolent tumor died with metastatic cRCC, most likely related to a contralateral pT3b cRCC which was not available for GEP analysis. Finally, GEP analysis of a cRCC bone metastasis predicted an indolent clinical course in a patient alive 6.7 years after presentation with metastatic cRCC.  Discussion Analysis of renal neoplasms using microarray techniques can provide diagnostic and prognostic information. 4 – 10 Several groups have hypothesized that data derived from these advanced molecular investigations will provide clinically-useful information. However, few groups have investigated the utility of these data in the context of current prediction tools that are based on established clinical and pathologic risk factors. Most of the initial publications investigating cDNA arrays employed only univariate analysis or accounted for only some of the major cRCC risk factors, but the true value of a new prognostic factor is determined based on its ability to provide additional prognostic information above and beyond current factors. Lam et al demonstrated proof-of-principle for the superiority of a combination of molecular and clinical factors over either approach alone, combining immunohistochemical data obtained from tissue microarray analysis with the UCLA-integrated symptom score (UISS). 11 We have investigated the utility of a 44-gene GEP derived from analysis of a novel, kidney cancer-related cDNA microarray in sporadic and multifocal cRCC in conjunction with SSIGN score, a predictive algorithm based on the major clinicopathologic risk factors for cRCC recurrence. In addition, we explore a new use for cDNA data, namely to provide additional information for cRCC of uncertain clinical stage. In the present study, we have demonstrated that a GEP comprised of 44 genes selected from among 3966 genes related to cancer and kidney development is able to distinguish between indolent and aggressive cRCC. The 44 genes include some factors identified in previous studies, as well as several other novel biomarkers. For example, the most highly over-expressed gene (2.7-fold) in our dataset, integrin alpha-2 (ITGA2) was also associated with poor survival in 2 previous cDNA studies and is the only gene in common between the gene lists of Zhao et al and our data. 10 Integrins mediate cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix interactions and are believed to play a primary role in tumor growth and metastasis. Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1, CXCL12) is a CXC chemokine that binds to CXCR4, a ligand-receptor interaction which has been implicated in leukocyte trafficking and HIV infection. Repression of CXCR4 gene expression has been reported to be associated with poorer outcomes in 4 prior RCC studies, 4 – 6 , 18 but we are the first to report altered expression of SDF-1 in association with RCC prognosis. Decreased expression of SERPINA5, a member of a large family of serine protease inhibitors, was associated with poorer survival in 5 prior cDNA studies, 4 , 5 , 7 , 18 and we report that down-regulation of a second family member (SERPINA7) is associated with poorer survival in cRCC. Finally, we found that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) cDNA was induced 1.6-fold in aggressive cRCC. Previous data have suggested that an altered pattern of EGFR protein expression may be associated with cRCC pathologic features. 19 , 20 Our own immunohistochemical analyses of 44 cRCC with at least 5-year follow-up found that increased membranous and cytosolic EGFR expression correlated with higher pathologic stage. 20 Thus, the findings of the current study appear to be consistent with other results obtained using different methodologies to evaluate these differentially-expressed genes at both the RNA and protein level. Moreover, we suggest that selected genes from the 44-gene GEP should be further examined by additional methodologies (RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and tissue microarray) in a larger subset of patients in order to further characterize them as prognostic factors and, potentially, targets for systemic therapy for advanced RCC. Kaplan-Meier estimates revealed a significant difference in the recurrence-free survival of cRCC predicted to demonstrate indolent or aggressive behavior based on GEP alone. In addition, in combination with SSIGN score, the GEP prediction was also able to define an intermediate-risk group that included patients with tumors predicted to be aggressive by either GEP prediction or SSIGN score (but not both). This suggests that molecular expression data can identify patients at higher risk of recurrence from those predicted to have low-risk disease based on standard clinical factors. It should be noted, however, that GEP was not an independent predictor of RFS in a cox proportional hazard model incorporating SSIGN score as a continuous variable. In the current study, SSIGN was chosen because it is the only predictive algorithm that applies directly to patients with localized cRCC and cRCC metastatic to lymph nodes or distant organs. Finally, GEP can help to characterize tumors of uncertain clinical stage, including patients with bilateral metachronous renal tumors. GEP prediction correlated perfectly with clinical outcome in 4 of 4 patients with metachronous renal cRCC. GEP prediction did not perform as well in the setting of bilateral synchronous cRCC, perhaps because not all renal tumors were available for analysis. Synthesis of information from tumors from each kidney may have provided improved results, but unfortunately tumor material was not available for analysis in the current study. In conclusion, we describe a genetic profile based on 44 genes that can distinguish between cRCC with indolent and aggressive clinical behavior. In combination with clinical prediction tools, this gene-expression profile can identify patients at intermediate or high risk for disease progression. These data provide proof-of-principle to support the use of molecular data not only in unilateral cRCC, but also in more complex situations, in which this information can help to clarify the clinical stage of patients with multiple renal tumors.

For example, the most highly over-expressed gene (2.7-fold) in our dataset, integrin alpha-2 (ITGA2) was also associated with poor survival in 2 previous cDNA studies and is the only gene in common between the gene lists of Zhao et al and our data. 10 Integrins mediate cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix interactions and are believed to play a primary role in tumor growth and metastasis. Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1, CXCL12) is a CXC chemokine that binds to CXCR4, a ligand-receptor interaction which has been implicated in leukocyte trafficking and HIV infection. Repression of CXCR4 gene expression has been reported to be associated with poorer outcomes in 4 prior RCC studies, 4 – 6 , 18 but we are the first to report altered expression of SDF-1 in association with RCC prognosis. Decreased expression of SERPINA5, a member of a large family of serine protease inhibitors, was associated with poorer survival in 5 prior cDNA studies, 4 , 5 , 7 , 18 and we report that down-regulation of a second family member (SERPINA7) is associated with poorer survival in cRCC. Finally, we found that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) cDNA was induced 1.6-fold in aggressive cRCC. Previous data have suggested that an altered pattern of EGFR protein expression may be associated with cRCC pathologic features. 19 , 20 Our own immunohistochemical analyses of 44 cRCC with at least 5-year follow-up found that increased membranous and cytosolic EGFR expression correlated with higher pathologic stage. 20 Thus, the findings of the current study appear to be consistent with other results obtained using different methodologies to evaluate these differentially-expressed genes at both the RNA and protein level. Moreover, we suggest that selected genes from the 44-gene GEP should be further examined by additional methodologies (RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and tissue microarray) in a larger subset of patients in order to further characterize them as prognostic factors and, potentially, targets for systemic therapy for advanced RCC. Kaplan-Meier estimates revealed a significant difference in the recurrence-free survival of cRCC predicted to demonstrate indolent or aggressive behavior based on GEP alone. In addition, in combination with SSIGN score, the GEP prediction was also able to define an intermediate-risk group that included patients with tumors predicted to be aggressive by either GEP prediction or SSIGN score (but not both). This suggests that molecular expression data can identify patients at higher risk of recurrence from those predicted to have low-risk disease based on standard clinical factors. It should be noted, however, that GEP was not an independent predictor of RFS in a cox proportional hazard model incorporating SSIGN score as a continuous variable. In the current study, SSIGN was chosen because it is the only predictive algorithm that applies directly to patients with localized cRCC and cRCC metastatic to lymph nodes or distant organs. Finally, GEP can help to characterize tumors of uncertain clinical stage, including patients with bilateral metachronous renal tumors. GEP prediction correlated perfectly with clinical outcome in 4 of 4 patients with metachronous renal cRCC. GEP prediction did not perform as well in the setting of bilateral synchronous cRCC, perhaps because not all renal tumors were available for analysis. Synthesis of information from tumors from each kidney may have provided improved results, but unfortunately tumor material was not available for analysis in the current study. In conclusion, we describe a genetic profile based on 44 genes that can distinguish between cRCC with indolent and aggressive clinical behavior. In combination with clinical prediction tools, this gene-expression profile can identify patients at intermediate or high risk for disease progression. These data provide proof-of-principle to support the use of molecular data not only in unilateral cRCC, but also in more complex situations, in which this information can help to clarify the clinical stage of patients with multiple renal tumors.  Figures and Tables Figure 1 Gene expression profiling (GEP) of conventional RCC.
