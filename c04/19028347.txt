Molecular Target Approaches in Head and Neck Cancer: EGFR and Beyond Approximately 50,000 new cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) will be diagnosed in the United States (US) in 2009. Whereas the gradual decline in smoking rates in the US is a highly favorable trend, future global HNSCC incidence will likely reflect the increased marketing and penetration of tobacco products across several of our most populous countries. Although modern surgery, radiation and conventional chemotherapy strategies for HNSCC continue to provide gradual improvement in outcome, the first molecular targeting approach to demonstrate a survival advantage for HNSCC patients has recently emerged in the context of EGFR biology. The scientific background and current challenges accompanying this recent advance are described in this article as are several additional promising molecular targets for HNSCC. There is cautious anticipation that the logical advancement of molecular targeting agents in conjunction with radiation may afford increased cure rates and diminished normal tissue toxicity profiles for HNSCC patients over the years to come.  Conclusions HNSCC provides a rich environment for preclinical and clinical study in light of the relative accessibility of tumor and normal tissue for controlled investigation. The recent incorporation of EGFR inhibitors into the available armamentarium for HNSCC therapy is a landmark development for a highly complex cancer. Several additional molecular targets of potential interest for HNSCC therapy are described in this article. Strategies that combine radiation with molecular targeting agents offer high promise for achieving meaningful improvements in HNSCC therapy. The radiation/EGFR story represents only the beginning of many successful future steps.
