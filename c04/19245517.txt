Prevalence and significance of cardiometabolic risk factors in children with type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common disease of childhood with a current prevalence of almost 2 cases per 1000 adolescents according to the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Modern insulin treatment has resulted in improved quality of life for children diagnosed with this chronic disorder. However, T1D continues to carry a long term burden of increased microvascular and macrovascular complications and mortality risk. Compared to the non-diabetic population patients with T1D are more likely to have one or more cardiovascular risk factors and often at an earlier age. Since the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors increases with age in young people with T1D there is a clear need for early screening and counseling to prevent their occurrence and manage long term health ramifications. The purpose of this review is to describe how traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease like lipid profile, hypertension, obesity, and insulin resistance contribute to the accelerated atherosclerosis seen in young people with T1D. A summary is given of the guidelines and recommendations published for clinical care for these subjects.  Conclusion and Summary Cardiovascular mortality and morbidity continues to be high in patients with type 1 diabetes in spite of the great advances made in the field of insulin delivery and blood sugar management. A holistic approach is needed to address all the cardiovascular risk factors that are commonly seen in these patients instead of just focusing on the glycemic control. Since T1D is a disease of childhood, pediatric endocrinologists and pediatricians need to be aware of the high burden of cardiovascular disease in this population. The old adage “Prevention is better than Cure” rings true, especially so in this population.  Tables Table I Blood pressure (BP) abnormalities in T1D and its relation to nephropathy.
