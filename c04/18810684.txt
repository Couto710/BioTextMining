Epidemiology and Treatment of Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis Multidrug resistant tuberculosis is now thought to afflict between 1 and 2 million patients annually. Although significant regional variability in the distribution of disease has been recorded, surveillance data are limited by several factors. The true burden of disease is likely underestimated. Nevertheless, the estimated burden is substantial enough to warrant concerted action. A range of approaches is possible, but all appropriate interventions require scale-up of laboratories and early treatment with regimens containing a sufficient number of second-line drugs. Ambulatory treatment for most patients, and improved infection control, can facilitate scale-up with decreased risk of nosocomial transmission. Several obstacles have been considered to preclude worldwide scale-up of treatment, mostly attributable to inadequate human, drug, and financial resources. Further delays in scale-up, however, risk continued generation and transmission of resistant tuberculosis, as well as associated morbidity and mortality.  MEETING THE CHALLENGE “Universal access to high-quality diagnosis and patient-centered treatment” is the first objective of the 2006 Stop TB Strategy. 127 A companion document, the MDR-TB/XDR-TB Response Plan set as a target, treatment of 1.6 million MDR-TB patients by 2015. 3 This number represents only 25 to 50% of estimated cases expected to occur before then. 1 Even with unprecedented opportunities created through global advocacy and substantially increased funding for treatment of DR-TB, implementation remains daunting and the goal elusive. Limitations in available human resources, as well as in current diagnostic and treatment tools, give pause to scale-up efforts. The risks of accelerating scale-up with incomplete information and partial infrastructure, however, need to be weighed against the consequences of continued limited action. In this final section, we present some of the primary concerns that have been raised and propose pragmatic responses to this global crisis. If MDR-TB Treatment Is Made Widely Available, Limited Second-Line Drugs Will Be Squandered through Emergence of Additional Resistance MDR-TB and XDR-TB are humanmade epidemics that result from inadequate TB treatment, outdated policy, and transmission. Experiences in the former Soviet Union, parts of Asia, and Latin America reveal that historical poor TB control led to high levels of resistant TB. 128 – 130 Motivated by a perceived need for a universal, cost-effective solution and preservation of costly, toxic, second-line drugs, the response was to impose rigid TB control, 131 which relied on repeated courses of standardized treatment with first-line drugs 132 – 134 and severely restricted the distribution of second-line drugs. 135 This strategy has been extremely successful in the treatment of drug-susceptible TB. In settings of important, extant resistance, however, this approach has been markedly less successful. 33 – 35 , 136 The 2004 GPADRS report suggests reasons for this failure: “present treatment practices create significant numbers of new resistant cases and amplify already present resistance,” singling out DOTS re-treatment regimens as problematic: “These results corroborate recently emerging evidence that standard re-treatment regimens containing first-line drugs for failures of standard treatment should be abandoned in some settings.” 137 When second-line regimens are finally introduced in this context, they are often inadequate for the resistance profiles of circulating strains. 52 In two examples, Peru and Korea, outcomes of standardized second-line treatment were poor. 138 , 139 Evidence from Peru and South Africa—where a similar standardized regimen was used—also reveals that, not surprisingly, resistance was further aggravated. 140 , 141 Moreover, this approach has yet to yield a detectable reduction in the overall burden of resistant disease in Peru or Korea. 2 Stable and decreasing trends in drug resistance were documented, in contrast, only in places with TB control strategies that include universal DST at first TB diagnosis and treatment with second-line drugs when indicated by one or more of the following: DST, prior exposure, or contact history ( Fig. 3 , option 2). Examples include Hong Kong, the United States, Latvia, Estonia, and several western European countries. 2 As with many infectious diseases, selection of resistant strains is inevitable in the presence of exposure to antimicrobial therapy. The rate at which they emerge, and the negative consequences of their emergence— morbidity, mortality, amplification of resistance, and transmission—can, however, be minimized through adherence to several principles. MDR-TB treatment with a consistent supply of quality-assured second-line drugs should be initiated early; advanced disease diminishes the chance of cure 117 , 142 and increases opportunity for transmission. Suboptimal regimens containing second-line drugs should be avoided, 52 and treatment adherence should be assured to impede resistance amplification. Measures must also be implemented to reduce transmission risk: these include hospitalizing only those patients who require it for medical reasons and improving administrative and environmental controls in hospitals, health centers, and communities. The GLC currently facilitates treatment consistent with these principles for a small number of TB programs that meet criteria for good TB control. An alternative and dangerous reality, however, prevails: an estimated 71,000 patients are being treated outside GLC auspices in 2007–08; during that interval only 22,000 patients were even approved under the GLC mechanism, and many fewer treated. Outside the GLC, patients are often treated with drugs of unknown quality, with untested and unsupervised regimens. Patients are often forced to purchase their own medicines and can only do so sporadically. Consequently, although the GLC mechanism limits distribution and use of quality- assured, second-line drugs, 143 non-quality-assured drugs circulate widely. Broader, not more limited, distribution of quality-assured drugs will be essential to achievement of targets. Control over their distribution will have to be exercised at the local, rather than the international level. When administered to new patients, or patients having failed only one prior treatment, second-line regimens will require fewer toxic drugs and will achieve better outcomes. 142 Nevertheless, regimens should be constructed to maximize probability of cure, not designed to “hold in reserve” some second-line drugs. The dangers of the alternatives are now well understood. And, with two new drugs already in clinical development for MDR-TB 110 , 111 —and a third showing promise in animal models 101 —treatment options will not always be so limited. Global Drug Supply Is Too Limited to Permit Scale-Up In addition to required policy changes described earlier, increased production is essential to permit wider distribution of quality-assured drugs. Current delays in delivery of orders through the GLC mechanism often exceed 6 months. Second-line drug manufacturers are stymied by inaccurate forecasting of drug needs. Lengthy lead time required to manufacture drugs, and, in some cases, shortages of raw materials, further aggravates the supply problem. † An additional obstacle to a growing drug supply is the perceived small market, represented by those initiating GLC-approved treatment. Dramatic scale-up of second-line drug production is critical but will not occur without increased demand and/or new incentives: with more aggressive implementation of laboratory support and treatment programs, in the context of health-systems strengthening, patient numbers will increase. Supply could also be bolstered through increased prequalification of manufacturers and products through the WHO’s Essential Drugs Program. Only 17 anti-TB products have been prequalified— among them one second-line drug—whereas 147 antiretroviral drugs or combinations are on the prequalification list. 144 Dozens of generic manufacturers are operating in high-burden MDR-TB countries, which have laws that preclude purchase of generic drugs made elsewhere. Enhanced access to prequalification could substantially increase the high-quality products available in and out of these settings. Lastly, novel incentives for drug discovery, development, and manufacturing must be explored. 145 , 146 MDR-TB Cannot Be Managed without Local Laboratory Capacity Although current protocols recommend baseline drug-susceptibility testing and frequent monitoring by sputum culture, treatment need not be delayed until these tests can be performed locally. Partnerships with reference laboratories, often with excess capacity and little TB, can be established to fill the gap while laboratory capacity is developed locally. This approach provides additional training opportunities for staff in laboratories in low TB-incidence settings. The Laboratory Strengthening Sub-Group of the DOTS Expansion Working Group of the Stop TB Partnership should facilitate these partnerships by developing a directory of laboratories interested in collaborating to ensure the successful shipment of samples and timely transmission of reliable results. These partnerships can further help to develop local laboratory capacity and facilitate external quality assurance. 82 Implementation of MDR-TB Treatment Should Follow Resistance Survey or Surveillance Data Designing treatment strategies and forecasting drug demand are challenging without good data. Yet, available models and empirical evidence demonstrate the substantial risks associated with a “business as usual” approach 33 – 35 , 140 , 141 while awaiting better data. Even if DOTS coverage and cure targets are achieved, frequency of failure will likely rise as the proportion of patients with resistant disease increases relative to the number of all TB patients. 147 Inadequately treated patients will transmit resistant strains and ultimately die. This cycle will be accelerated in settings with high HIV prevalence due to the increased incidence of TB. 148 It is essential to develop a range of mechanisms that facilitate treatment with second-line drugs in patients with risk factors for MDR-TB, or for poor outcomes. If local epidemiological data are not available to identify these groups, selection criteria should at least include patients in whom prior treatment failed to result in a sustained cure, those not responding to first-line TB treatment (especially if they are HIV coinfected), and individuals with close exposure to MDR-TB patients (e.g., household contacts, health care workers, prisoners, etc.). Empirical regimens can be constructed based on treatment history and available DST results. There Are Too Few Hospital Beds and Too Few Health Care Workers to Scale Up MDR-TB Treatment Inpatient initiation of MDR-TB therapy is unlikely to be the optimal strategy in settings where limited numbers of hospital beds, doctors, and nurses as well as the prohibitive cost of inpatient care result in enrollment bottlenecks. Moreover, the current lack of infection control virtually guarantees transmission to other patients and health care workers. 149 , 150 In some settings, forced hospitalization has raised serious human rights concerns, 151 , 152 especially in light of poor treatment outcomes. 149 Ambulatory, especially community-based, treatment can alleviate these problems. 153 Task-shifting to community health workers—supervised by nurses and doctors—for the bulk of the patient contact also has significant benefits in light of the human resource and financial challenges confronting many health systems. Hospitalization should be reserved for patients for whom it is medically indicated. Infection control efforts should prioritize administrative and environmental measures. In Light of Limited Resources for TB Control, Scaled-Up Treatment of MDR-TB Is Unrealistic Building an MDR-TB program on an already fragile and burdened TB service is daunting. Management of adverse events, HIV-coinfected patients, and often-tenuous relationships with private providers represent significant challenges. Addressing MDR-TB, however, need not threaten the health system. Rather, it can infuse additional resources, including: access to new funding sources, training of new health care workers, and integration of services. 154 , 155 Moreover, it can be used to raise the standard of care: while still treating ~25,000 new TB patients annually in Peru, the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) now assures culture and DST to all patients failing first-line treatment. This is especially true when ambulatory systems of treatment support are developed and used to deliver integrated primary care services. Private providers, who have been successfully engaged in the implementation of DOTS with quality-assured drugs, can also be trained to manage resistant disease. In addition, the funding climate has changed profoundly since the myths surrounding MDR-TB in resource-poor settings were first exposed in 1998 156 : the recent influx of international funding (e.g., from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the International Drug Purchase Facility, referred to as UNITAID) and outside expertise should counter the scarcity mentality. Although the challenge of building a program is enormous, resources are no longer the obstacle. There Is Too Little Expertise Available Globally to Support Scale Up With GLC-approved projects functioning since 2000, there is growing global expertise in the management of MDR-TB. Consultants can be drawn from more experienced programs to support implementation and scale-up in settings with similar conditions. Regional centers of excellence in all elements of DR-TB management represent one possible approach to facilitating scale-up. Referral to the cadre of experts in management, scale-up, laboratory, and infection control, which is no longer limited to a handful of individuals from industrialized countries, should be facilitated by the MDR-TB Working Group of the STOP TB Partnership. Treatment Recommendations Are Based on Expert Opinion, Rather than on Evidence from Randomized, Controlled Trials Although no large-scale randomized, controlled trials of MDR-TB regimens have been implemented, a growing body of evidence from observational studies has been used to develop recommendations for MDR-TB management. 114 These recommendations do not advocate a single approach, rather they present a range of options, adaptable to local conditions. Questions about optimal drug combinations and duration persist. 157 Nevertheless, programs following existing recommendations have achieved cure in up to 80% of patients. 117 , 120 , 121 , 124 The dangers of waiting until these controversies have been resolved for broader implementation include ongoing transmission, morbidity, mortality, and generation of increasingly drug resistant strains.

CONCLUSION We have reviewed existing data on the global burden of DR-TB, and argue that, despite gaps in knowledge, sufficient evidence exists to exhort global action. We have described a broad range of models, emphasizing the need to adapt these models based on local context. Finally, we confront some of the perceived obstacles that have resulted in exceptionally slow scale-up and urge innovation to permit achievement of targets.
