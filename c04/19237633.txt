PIK3CA Mutation is Associated with Poor Prognosis among Patients with Curatively Resected Colon Cancer PURPOSE PIK3CA mutation and subsequent activation of the AKT pathway play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. However, little has been known on the prognostic role of PIK3CA mutation in colon cancer. METHODS Utilizing 450 resectable colon cancers (stage I-III) in two independent prospective cohorts, we detected PIK3CA mutation in 82 (18%) tumors by Pyrosequencing. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of colon cancer-specific and overall mortalities, adjusted for patient characteristics and tumoral molecular features, including the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), microsatellite instability (MSI) and KRAS and BRAF mutation. RESULTS Compared to patients with PIK3CA -wild-type tumors, those with PIK3CA -mutated tumors experienced an increase in colon-cancer specific mortality by the univariate analysis [HR 1.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.95-2.86], which persisted after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors for cancer recurrence (multivariate HR 2.23, 95% CI, 1.21-4.11). The effect of PIK3CA mutation on cancer survival appeared to differ according to KRAS -mutational status. Among patients with KRAS -wild-type tumors, the presence of PIK3CA mutation was associated with a significant increase in colon cancer-specific mortality (HR 3.80, 95% CI, 1.56-9.27). In contrast, PIK3CA mutation conferred no significant effect on mortality among patients with KRAS -mutated tumors (HR 1.25; 95% CI, 0.52-2.96), although the interaction was not statistically significant (Pinteraction=0.13). CONCLUSION Among patients who undergo a curative resection of colon cancer, PIK3CA mutation is associated with shorter cancer-specific survival. The adverse effect of PIK3CA mutation may be potentially limited to patients with KRAS -wild-type tumors.  INTRODUCTION Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway is thought to play a critical role in the development of a variety of human malignancies, and several efforts are underway to define therapeutic inhibitors of the pathway. 1 , 2 PI3K interacts with phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PIP3) at the membrane, and catalyzes the phosphorylation of AKT, which activates the downstream signaling pathway. 1 The PIK3CA gene encodes the catalytic subunit p110 alpha of PI3K. 1 , 2 Mutant PIK3CA stimulates the AKT pathway, and promotes cell growth in various cancers including colon cancer. 3 In addition, PI3K and AKT regulates mTOR (FRAP) pathway that plays a pivotal role in the link between energy balance and tumor cell growth. 1 - 4 PIK3CA mutations have been described in 10-30% of colon cancers, 5 - 12 and associated with KRAS mutation, 8 , 13 and microsatellite instability (MSI). 12 In one small previous study of patients with colorectal cancer, PIK3CA mutation was associated with an inferior prognosis; however, a statistical power was limited in that analysis. 11 A second study in colorectal cancer suggested that, in aggregate, the presence of mutations in PIK3CA , KRAS or BRAF conferred a worse patient outcome, but the effect of mutations in PIK3CA alone was not reported. 8 Thus, the relation of PIK3CA mutation to patient outcome in colon cancer still remains uncertain. Among patients with curatively resected colon cancer who were participating in two large ongoing observational cohort studies, we examined the effect of PIK3CA mutations on patient survival. Since we concurrently assessed other tumoral molecular alterations including p53, KRAS and BRAF mutations, MSI, and the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), we could evaluate the independent effect of PIK3CA mutation after controlling for these related molecular events.  METHODS Utilizing 450 resectable colon cancers (stage I-III) in two independent prospective cohorts, we detected PIK3CA mutation in 82 (18%) tumors by Pyrosequencing. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of colon cancer-specific and overall mortalities, adjusted for patient characteristics and tumoral molecular features, including the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), microsatellite instability (MSI) and KRAS and BRAF mutation.  RESULTS Compared to patients with PIK3CA -wild-type tumors, those with PIK3CA -mutated tumors experienced an increase in colon-cancer specific mortality by the univariate analysis [HR 1.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.95-2.86], which persisted after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors for cancer recurrence (multivariate HR 2.23, 95% CI, 1.21-4.11). The effect of PIK3CA mutation on cancer survival appeared to differ according to KRAS -mutational status. Among patients with KRAS -wild-type tumors, the presence of PIK3CA mutation was associated with a significant increase in colon cancer-specific mortality (HR 3.80, 95% CI, 1.56-9.27).

The adverse effect of PIK3CA mutation may be potentially limited to patients with KRAS -wild-type tumors.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Population We utilized the databases of two independent prospective cohort studies; the Nurses' Health Study (N = 121,700 women followed since 1976), 14 , 15 and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (N = 51,500 men followed since 1986). 15 Every 2 years, participants have been sent follow-up questionnaires to update information on potential risk factors and to identify newly diagnosed cancer and other diseases. We calculated body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), using self-reported height from the baseline questionnaire and weight from the biennial questionnaire that immediately preceded the diagnosis of colon cancer. In validation studies in both cohorts, self-reported anthropometric measures were well correlated with measurements by trained technicians (r >0.96). 16 On each biennial follow-up questionnaire, participants were asked whether they had a diagnosis of colon cancer during the previous 2 years. When a participant (or next of kin for decedents) reported colon cancer, we sought permission to obtain medical records. Study physicians, while blinded to exposure data, reviewed all records related to colon cancer, and recorded AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) tumor stage and tumor location. For nonresponders, we searched the National Death Index to discover deaths and ascertain any diagnosis of colon cancer that contributed to death or was a secondary diagnosis. Approximately 96% of all incident colon cancer cases were identified through these methods. We collected paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from hospitals where colon cancer patients underwent resections of primary tumors 15 . Tissue sections from all colon cancer cases were reviewed and confirmed by a pathologist (S.O.). Tumor grade was categorized as high (?50% glandular area) or low (>50% glandular area) 17 . We excluded cases for which only biopsy tissue was available, because there was a very small amount of tissue left after pathological examination at original hospitals, and differential availability of results from biopsies might cause bias. Based on availability of tissue samples, we included a total of 450 stage I-III colon cancer cases (206 from the men's cohort and 244 from the women's cohort) diagnosed up to 2002. Written informed consent was obtained from all study subjects. This study was approved by the Human Subjects Committees at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health. Measurement of Mortality Patients were observed until death or June 2006, whichever came first. Ascertainment of deaths included reporting by the family or postal authorities. In addition, the names of persistent nonresponders were searched in the National Death Index. The cause of death was assigned by physicians blinded to information on lifestyle exposures and molecular changes in colon cancer. In rare patients who died as a result of colon cancer not previously reported, we obtained medical records with permission from next of kin. More than 98% of deaths in the cohorts were identified by these methods. 18 Genomic DNA Extraction and Pyrosequencing of<italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>BRAF</italic> Genomic DNA from paraffin-embedded tissue was extracted, and whole genome amplification of genomic DNA was performed by PCR using random 15-mer primers. 19 PCR and Pyrosequencing targeted for PIK3CA exons 9 and 20 (mutation hotspots) ( Figure 1 ), KRAS codons 12 and 13, and BRAF codon 600 were performed as previously described. 13 , 19 Real-Time PCR (MethyLight) to Determine CIMP (CpG Island Methylator Phenotype) Status Sodium bisulfite treatment on tumor DNA and subsequent real-time PCR (MethyLight) assays were validated and performed as previously described. 20 , 21 We quantified promoter methylation in 8 CIMP-specific genes ( CACNA1G , CDKN2A ( p16 ), CRABP1 , IGF2 , MLH1 , NEUROG1, RUNX3 and SOCS1 ). 22 - 24 The PCR condition was initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min. CIMP-high was defined as ?6/8 methylated promoters using the 8-marker CIMP panel, CIMP-low as 1 to 5 methylated promoters, and CIMP-0 as 0/8 methylated promoters, according to the previously established criteria. 23 Pyrosequencing to Measure LINE-1 Methylation In order to accurately quantify relatively high LINE-1 methylation levels, we utilized Pyrosequencing as previously described. 25 LINE-1 methylation level measured by Pyrosequencing has been shown to correlate well with overall 5-methylcytosine level (i.e., global DNA methylation level) in tumor cells. 26 , 27 Microsatellite Instability (MSI) Analysis MSI status was determined as previously described. 23 In addition to the recommended MSI panel consisting of D2S123, D5S346, D17S250, BAT25 and BAT26, 28 we used BAT40, D18S55, D18S56, D18S67 and D18S487 (i.e., 10-marker panel). 23 A “high degree of MSI” (MSI-high) was defined as the presence of instability in ?30% of the markers, MSI-low as the presence of instability in <30% of the markers, and microsatellite stability (MSS) as no unstable marker. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) and immunohistochemistry for p53 Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed and immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described. 15 , 29 Appropriate positive and negative controls were included in each run of immunohistochemistry. All immunohistochemically-stained slides were interpreted by a pathologist (S.O.) blinded from clinical and other laboratory data. A random sample of 118 tumors were re-examined for p53 by a second observer (K.N.) unaware of other data. The concordance between the two observers was 0.87 (?=0.75, p<0.0001), indicating substantial agreement. Statistical Analysis We used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of death according to tumoral PIK3CA status, unadjusted and adjusted for age, sex, BMI, year of diagnosis, tumor location, stage, grade, and statuses of MSI, CIMP, LINE-1, KRAS , BRAF and p53. For analyses of colon cancer-specific mortality, death as a result of colon cancer was the primary end point and deaths as a result of other causes were censored. To adjust for potential confounding, age and year of diagnosis were used as continuous variables, and all of the other covariates were used as categorical variables. We dichotomized tumor location (proximal vs. distal), BMI (<30 kg/m2 vs. ?30 kg/m2), tumor grade (high vs. low), CIMP (high vs. low/0), MSI (high vs. low/MSS), p53 (positive vs. negative), KRAS (mutated vs. wild-type) and BRAF (mutated vs. wild-type). There were 3 categories for LINE-1 methylation (?70%, 55-70%, and <55%). When there was missing information on tumor location (0.7% missing), tumor grade (0.7% missing), LINE-1 (2.7% missing), MSI (0.2% missing), p53 (0.9% missing), KRAS (0.4% missing) or BRAF (2.7% missing), we assigned a separate (“missing”) indicator variable and included those cases in the multivariate analysis models. We confirmed that excluding cases with a missing variable did not significantly alter results (data not shown). An interaction was assessed by including the cross product of the PIK3CA variable and another variable of interest in a multivariate Cox model, and the likelihood ratio test was performed. To assess an interaction of PIK3CA and stage, we dichotomized tumor stage (I-II vs. III; p for interaction =0.67), as well as treated stage as a linear ordinal variable (from I to III; p for interaction =0.84), to confirm no significant interaction. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to describe the distribution of colon cancer-specific and overall survival time, and the log-rank test was performed. The chi square test was used to examine an association between categorical variables. The t-test assuming unequal variances was performed to compare mean age and mean LINE-1 methylation level. All analyses used SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and all p values were two-sided.

RESULTS <italic>PIK3CA</italic> Mutation in Colon Cancer Among 450 patients who had undergone a curative resection of stage I-III colon cancer, we detected PIK3CA mutations in 82 (18%) by Pyrosequencing technology ( Figure 1 ). We assessed characteristics of clinical, pathologic and molecular features of colon cancer cases, according to PIK3CA mutational status ( Table 1 ). Compared to PIK3CA wild-type tumors, PIK3CA -mutated tumors were more likely to demonstrate KRAS mutation (p <0.0001), and less likely to show p53 expression (p = 0.01). PIK3CA mutation was not significantly associated with any clinical features examined. <italic>PIK3CA</italic> Mutation and Patient Survival We assessed the influence of PIK3CA mutation on patient survival in resectable colon cancer (stage I-III). Compared to patients with PIK3CA -wild-type tumors, those with PIK3CA -mutated tumors experienced an increase in cancer-specific mortality [univariate hazard ratio (HR) 1.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.95-2.86] ( Table 2 ), although statistical significance was not reached. In the multivariate Cox model adjusting for potential predictors of patient outcome, PIK3CA mutation was associated with a significant increase in colon cancer-specific mortality (HR 2.23; 95% CI, 1.21-4.11). The increase in the effect of PIK3CA mutation on survival in the multivariate analysis was mainly the result of adjusting for tumor stage, p53, and BMI; when we adjusted for tumor stage, p53 and BMI, the HR for colon cancer-specific mortality for COX-2 positive tumors was 2.03 (95% CI, 1.15-3.57). In contrast, PIK3CA mutation was not significantly associated with overall mortality in both univariate and multivariate analyses. We further examined 5-year survival according to PIK3CA mutational status. Colon cancer-specific survival at 5 years was 90% for patients with PIK3CA -wild-type tumors as compared to 82% for those with PIK3CA -mutated tumors (log rank p = 0.075) ( Figure 2 ). Overall survival was not significantly different according to PIK3CA status (84% in PIK3CA -wild-type tumors vs. 78% in PIK3CA -mutated tumors; long rank p = 0.97). We also assessed PIK3CA exon 9 mutations and exon 20 mutations separately. There was, however, no significant difference in mortality between exon 9 and exon 20 mutations (data not shown). Combined <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic> Mutational Status and Prognosis Given the potential interaction between the RAS and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, we examined the influence of KRAS mutational status on the adverse prognostic effect of mutations in PIK3CA ( Table 3 ). Among patients with KRAS -wild-type tumors, the presence of PIK3CA mutation was associated with a significant increase in colon cancer-specific mortality (multivariate HR 3.80, 95% CI, 1.56-9.27). In contrast, PIK3CA mutation conferred no significant effect on patient outcome among patients with KRAS -mutated tumors. However, a test for interaction between KRAS and PIK3CA did not reach statistical significance (P for interaction = 0.13). Stratified Analysis of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> Mutation and Prognosis We further examined the influence of PIK3CA mutation on colon cancer-specific mortality across strata of other potential predictors of patient survival ( Figure 3 ). The increased risk of cancer-specific death was apparent in all subgroups (although a wide 95% CI was noted in some subgroups). Notably, the effect of PIK3CA mutation was not significantly modified by age, sex, year of diagnosis, tumor location, stage, grade, BRAF , p53, MSI, LINE-1 or CIMP (all P for interaction ?0.13).

In the multivariate Cox model adjusting for potential predictors of patient outcome, PIK3CA mutation was associated with a significant increase in colon cancer-specific mortality (HR 2.23; 95% CI, 1.21-4.11). The increase in the effect of PIK3CA mutation on survival in the multivariate analysis was mainly the result of adjusting for tumor stage, p53, and BMI; when we adjusted for tumor stage, p53 and BMI, the HR for colon cancer-specific mortality for COX-2 positive tumors was 2.03 (95% CI, 1.15-3.57). In contrast, PIK3CA mutation was not significantly associated with overall mortality in both univariate and multivariate analyses. We further examined 5-year survival according to PIK3CA mutational status. Colon cancer-specific survival at 5 years was 90% for patients with PIK3CA -wild-type tumors as compared to 82% for those with PIK3CA -mutated tumors (log rank p = 0.075) ( Figure 2 ). Overall survival was not significantly different according to PIK3CA status (84% in PIK3CA -wild-type tumors vs. 78% in PIK3CA -mutated tumors; long rank p = 0.97). We also assessed PIK3CA exon 9 mutations and exon 20 mutations separately. There was, however, no significant difference in mortality between exon 9 and exon 20 mutations (data not shown).  Combined <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic> Mutational Status and Prognosis Given the potential interaction between the RAS and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, we examined the influence of KRAS mutational status on the adverse prognostic effect of mutations in PIK3CA ( Table 3 ). Among patients with KRAS -wild-type tumors, the presence of PIK3CA mutation was associated with a significant increase in colon cancer-specific mortality (multivariate HR 3.80, 95% CI, 1.56-9.27). In contrast, PIK3CA mutation conferred no significant effect on patient outcome among patients with KRAS -mutated tumors. However, a test for interaction between KRAS and PIK3CA did not reach statistical significance (P for interaction = 0.13).

Stratified Analysis of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> Mutation and Prognosis We further examined the influence of PIK3CA mutation on colon cancer-specific mortality across strata of other potential predictors of patient survival ( Figure 3 ). The increased risk of cancer-specific death was apparent in all subgroups (although a wide 95% CI was noted in some subgroups). Notably, the effect of PIK3CA mutation was not significantly modified by age, sex, year of diagnosis, tumor location, stage, grade, BRAF , p53, MSI, LINE-1 or CIMP (all P for interaction ?0.13).

DISCUSSION PIK3CA mutation and subsequent activation of the AKT pathway are considered to play an important role in colon cancer development and clinical behavior. 1 , 5 , 8 , 11 When activated by these mechanisms, the PI3K/AKT pathway provides important downstream signals that promote cellular proliferation, survival, invasion, and neoangiogenesis. 1 , 2 In preclinical studies, inhibitors of PI3K and AKT have demonstrated antitumor activity in colon cancer cells, both alone and in combination with other agents, suggesting their possible utility in patients with colon cancer. 30 , 31 We therefore examined the prognostic significance of PIK3CA mutation among 450 patients who had undergone a curative resection of colon cancer. We found that tumoral PIK3CA mutation was associated with worse survival. The adverse effect of PIK3CA mutation on prognosis appeared to be robust and consistent across most strata of clinical and tumoral predictors of patient outcome. However, we did observe that the adverse effect of PIK3CA mutation was potentially limited to patients with KRAS -wild-type tumors. Detection of molecular aberrations in neoplastic lesions is important in cancer research, 32 - 37 and molecular classification is increasing important in colon cancer. 38 , 39 We utilized Pyrosequencing assay to detect PIK3CA mutation in colon cancer, as we previously developed the assay. 13 Pyrosequencing assay for PIK3CA mutation detection is certainly useful, because most activating PIK3CA mutations cluster in hotspots of exons 9 and 20, affecting the functionally important helical and kinase domains. 24 , 40 We also utilized Pyrosequencing for KRAS and BRAF mutation detection and for quantification of LINE-1 (long interspersed nucleotide element-1) methylation level, as we have previously described. 19 , 25 Pyrosequencing is a sensitive and quantitative sequencing assay and can reliably detect a mutant allele of low abundance (5-10% mutant) among wild-type alleles, 19 which is a rather common situation in solid tumors. In fact, distribution and frequencies of various PIK3CA mutations in our sample are compatible with data in the previous studies. 5 - 8 , 11 , 12 Moreover, we have successfully demonstrated that PIK3CA mutation in colon cancer is associated with KRAS mutation, and inversely with p53 expression. 13 Little has been known regarding the impact of PIK3CA mutation in colon cancer on patient survival. One study has shown that PIK3CA mutation appears to predict shorter survival in colorectal cancers; 11 however, there were only 18 PIK3CA -mutated tumors, and the number of deaths was not reported. Another recent study has shown that the presence of at least one mutation in PIK3CA , BRAF or KRAS predicts poor survival in a population-based colon cancer sample; 8 however, the effect of PIK3CA mutation (by itself) on survival independent of clinical and other molecular predictors of outcome was not described. In contrast, using PIK3CA Pyrosequencing technology, mutations in PIK3CA were detected in 82 (18%) of 450 patients and conferred an inferior survival, independent of clinical and other molecular predictors of patient outcome. In addition, we have also shown that the adverse effect of PIK3CA mutation on cancer mortality appeared to persist in KRAS -wild-type tumors whereas the effect of PIK3CA mutation was markedly attenuated among KRAS -mutated tumors. A growing body of evidence suggests that KRAS mutational status may define response to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in a variety of human cancers, including colon cancer. 32 , 41 - 43 It is conceivable that the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway may play much more important role in tumor aggressiveness in a background where the KRAS oncogene is not constitutively activated by a somatic mutation. Nonetheless, although our findings were generated from two prospective cohort studies, the results remain hypothesis-generating and require independent confirmation. Moreover, future clinical trials of therapeutic inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT pathway may consider KRAS mutational status as a pre-defined stratification factor. In our cohorts, data on cancer treatment were limited. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that chemotherapy use differed according to tumoral PIK3CA status, since such data were not available to patients or treating physicians. In addition, beyond cause of mortality, data on cancer recurrences were not available in these cohorts. Nonetheless, given the median survival for metastatic colon cancer was approximately 10 to 12 months during much of the time period of this study 44 , colon cancer-specific survival should be a reasonable surrogate for cancer-specific outcomes. In summary, our large cohort study suggests that PIK3CA mutation is associated with poor survival in resectable stage I-III colon cancer. These findings may have considerable clinical implications. Considerable effort has been focused on defining therapeutic inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT pathway in colon cancer as well as other common malignancies. Future studies are needed to confirm this association as well as to elucidate exact mechanisms by which PIK3CA mutation affects tumor behavior.
