Beyond genetics: surprising determinants of cell fate in anti-tumor drugs Summary In this issue of Cancer Cell, Gascoigne and Taylor report their findings of following 10,000 single cells incubated with three classes of anti-mitotic drugs, including paclitaxel. This extensive analysis reveals an unappreciated complexity in response to such drugs and demonstrates that it's more than genetics that determine life or death.
