The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) Study The etiology of type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains unknown, but a growing body of evidence points to infectious agents and/or components of early childhood diet. The National Institutes of Health has established the TEDDY Study consortium of six clinical centers in the United States and Europe and a data coordinating center to identify environmental factors predisposing to, or protective against, islet autoimmunity and T1D. From 2004–2009, TEDDY will screen more than 360,000 newborns from both the general population and families already affected by T1D to identify an estimated 17,804 children with high-risk HLA-DR, DQ genotypes. Of those, 7,801 (788 first-degree relatives and 7,013 newborns with no family history of T1D) will be enrolled in prospective follow-up beginning before the age of 4.5 months. As of May 2008, TEDDY has screened more than 250,000 newborns and enrolled nearly 5,000 infants—approximately 70% of the final cohort. Participants are seen every 3 months up to 4 years of age, with subsequent visits every 6 months until the subject is 15 years of age. Blood samples are collected at each visit for detection of candidate infectious agents and nutritional biomarkers; monthly stool samples are collected for infectious agents. These samples are saved in a central repository. Primary endpoints include (1) appearance of one or more islet autoantibodies (to insulin, GAD65 or IA-2) confirmed at two consecutive visits; (2) development of T1D. By age 15, an estimated 800 children will develop islet autoimmunity and 400 will progress to T1D; 67 and 27 children have already reached these endpoints.  TEDDY Study: Organization and Goals The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY), a multicenter prospective cohort study, was initiated in 2003 to identify environmental factors that trigger or protect against the development of islet autoimmunity and T1D. The details of the TEDDY study’s organization and protocol have been previously published. 62 In brief: the consortium comprises 6 clinical centers located in Denver (Colorado), Augusta (Georgia)/Gainesville (Florida), and Seattle (Washington) in the United States, and in Finland (Turku), Sweden (Malmo), and Germany (Munich). The Data Coordinating Center is in Tampa, Florida. Autoantibody Reference Laboratories are located in Denver (serving the U.S. Clinical Centers) and Bristol (serving the European Clinical Centers). The Central Genetics Reference Laboratory is in Oakland, California, and the Central mRNA Laboratory is in Augusta, Georgia. The NIDDK Bio-sample and Genetics Repositories store samples. For more details, see the Appendix . The primary objectives of this study are: To identify environmental factors that trigger or protect against the development of islet autoantibodies or T1D. Infectious agents : Blood and stool samples as well as other bodily fluids are collected and analyzed for infectious agents to test the hypothesis that specific virus(es) may trigger islet autoimmunity or promote progression to T1D. In addition, the hypothesis that certain infections may reduce the risk of islet autoimmunity or T1D will also be tested. Dietary factors : Primary caretakers provide 3-day food diaries and 24-hour-recall dietary records, and blood samples are used to analyze vitamin D, alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, cartenoids, ascorbic acid, and red blood cell membrane fatty acids to test the hypothesis that dietary factors may trigger/accelerate/reduce islet autoimmunity or promote progression to T1D. Psychosocial factors : Stressful life events and other indicators of stress in the child and family are monitored to assess their contribution, if any, to the development of islet autoimmunity or T1D. In addition, participating families provide structured information that may help to identify factors affecting retention and study participation. Other : TEDDY will evaluate other factors such as toxins, immunizations, pets, and allergies in the triggering of and/or protection against islet autoimmunity or T1D. Genes both within and outside the HLA region are typed to identify gene–environment interactions. It is expected that the joint analyses of genetic and environmental data will improve the identification of both genetic and environmental factors influencing development of islet autoimmunity and T1D, and may explain mechanisms of these interactive effects. The prospectively collected specimens from TEDDY subjects (DNA, RNA, serum and plasma, cells and other samples) provide a unique opportunity for scientists within and outside the TEDDY consortium to test novel hypotheses.  Study Progress Consent for genetic screening is obtained from parents of babies born in area hospitals or identified after birth. This blood sample is analyzed at approved and monitored laboratories for the HLA haplotypes that qualify a child for TEDDY. Those results are returned to the DCC and local clinical centers, who notify all subjects of the genetic screening outcome. Among those who are HLA-eligible, trained local staff (e.g., study nurses) contact the subject’s parent to explain genetic risk and introduce in some detail the follow-up phase of TEDDY for which their child is now eligible to join. Enrollment, informed consent, and completion of the first visit must occur before the child reaches the age of 4.5 months. Once this visit has been completed the subject is then on the follow-up visit schedule for data collection described below. A portion of the 9-month blood sample is used to confirm HLA eligibility at a central reference laboratory, where additional high-resolution typing is done to confirm eligibility. Table 1 summarizes current TEDDY accruals by center and cohort (FDRs versus infants without a history of T1D in a FDR). Table 2 compares current accruals with the overall study goals for the number of infants to complete screening, found eligible, and enrolled into follow-up. As of May 2008, TEDDY has screened more than 250,000 newborns and enrolled nearly 5,000 infants—approximately 70% of the study goals. As shown in Figure 3 , TEDDY is ahead of the enrollment goals by several months and on track to complete the screening and enrollment by the end of 2009. Eligible children are enrolled into intensive prospective follow-up before the age of 4.5 months. The childrens’ exposure to dietary and other environmental factors is recorded at clinic visits every three months for the first 4 years of life and then biannually until age 15. Stool samples are collected to assess viral exposures at monthly intervals for the first 4 years and then biannually until age 15. The prospective data collection protocol is summarized in Table 3 . Compliance rates to specific data collection components of the protocol are at high levels ( Table 4 ). Figure 4 indicates that there is a small early loss to follow-up after the initial couple of visits that is consistent with observations from previous similar cohort studies (DAISY in Colorado and DIPP in Finland). The loss seems to plateau after the subjects reach 1 year of age and is noticeably lower among the FDRs. The overall rate of disenrollment is 9% over 2 years, and 12% by the age of 30 months, well within the planning parameters of the study. Single missed visits range from 2% (month 27) to 7% (month 18). Data beyond 30 months are considered too recent to provide reliable estimates.  Standardization of Assays for Islet Autoantibodies TEDDY is unique among the NIDDK-sponsored studies in having two core autoantibody laboratories with confirmation of positive samples in both laboratories before samples are classified as positive. This strategy was agreed on (i) to have a high degree of certainty in positive results, an important consideration in view of the numerous samples tested for three autoantibodies from each subject, and (ii) to provide an internal mechanism for checking and improving assay performance. We believe that the strategy has proved highly successful in both of these areas. Having two laboratories has posed additional requirements with respect to establishing concordance and the TEDDY study has performed several tasks addressing this point. Prior to inception of the study protocol, and in order to determine and improve concordance of measurement during TEDDY, both laboratories measured autoantibodies to insulin, GAD65, and IA-2 in serum samples from 496 nondiabetic high-risk children (from the DAISY study) and from 60 patients with new-onset disease. Analysis of these data showed that there were differences between calling sample positives caused by different relative thresholds in the two laboratories. The data were used to simulate performance (ROC analysis) and concordance at different thresholds and to determine the thresholds from each laboratory that were expected to be equivalent on a common sample set. These thresholds were selected for the TEDDY protocol. Because of the number of studies using islet autoantibodies as an outcome or selection criteria and the observations made with respect to two laboratories in TEDDY, the NIDDK decided to endorse this proposal and to embark on developing a common method of measurement (Islet Autoantibody Measurement Harmonization Project). Children are born with maternal IgG, including maternal islet autoantibodies, especially if the child has a mother with diabetes. It is necessary to exclude positive results that are due to this maternal IgG transmission when defining subject outcome. An algorithm was developed that considered islet autoantibody status of the mother (measured when the child was aged 6 or 9 months), whether a child had a negative sample prior to their first positive sample, and whether the islet autoantibody titer increased or decreased in subsequent samples. TEDDY participants are considered persistently islet autoantibody–positive (major study end point) if they had at least two confirmed positive samples that were not due to maternal islet autoantibody transfer or if they had one confirmed positive sample and developed diabetes prior to the next sample collection. The study protocol requires that all positive samples and 5% of negative samples be tested in the second central laboratory. As of March 31, 2008, 53 children from the general population and 16 FDRs have developed persistent islet autoantibody. The cumulative incidence of this endpoint by the age of 40 months was 4.6% in FDRs and 2.8% in the general population children. However, some young FDRs may later be reclassified as having had maternal autoantibodies as data mature.  Development of Type 1 Diabetes As of March 31, 2008, 21 children from the general population and 6 FDRs have developed T1D. The cumulative incidence of this endpoint by the age of 40 months was 2.5% in FDRs and 1.8% in the general population children. Preliminary observations suggest that the participation in TEDDY significantly reduced the severity of clinical presentation and has eliminated most of the expected hospitalizations and DKA in these very young patients.  Other Accomplishments TEDDY has mapped the frequencies of T1D susceptibility genotypes in diverse populations including African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanics in the United States. Preliminary results have been presented elsewhere. 63 The study developed novel comparisons and standardization between the four national TEDDY food databases (U.S., German, Swedish, and Finnish). A comprehensive nutrient data dictionary has been compiled of different nutrients that are calculated in TEDDY: units of measurement, methods of analysis, and derivations and descriptions of each nutrient in each TEDDY food database. Most nutrients are comparable between the databases, whereas some need to be recalculated (protein, energy) and some are not comparable between all of the four databases (fiber, folate), and all the databases do not contain all TEDDY nutrients (e.g., some of the fatty acids). The Finnish and Swedish national food databases (which both are used in TEDDY) take part in an EU program (Eurofir), which aims at harmonization of algorithms that will result in more uniform procedures (especially at the food level) and will, in the long run, benefit TEDDY. TEDDY has already discovered significant differences in infant feeding practices between the United States and Europe 64 and is exploring variability in infant nutrition within the U.S. population. The TEDDY protocol includes studies focused on identification of psychosocial factors that predispose to or protect from ? cell autoimmunity and T1D. A secondary objective is to explore the psychosocial corollaries of the ascertainment of risk status for autoimmunity and T1D in newborns. In addition, the TEDDY Psychosocial Committee assists with developing appropriate procedures and identifying resources to assure adequate informed consent, minimize study burden, maximize procedure convenience/comfort, thank and support participants, and provide psychosocial support, as needed. Parent anxiety in response to the infants’ increased risk is assessed using a 6-item short form of Spielberger’s State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) administered when the child was 3–4.5 months old and again when the child is 6-months old. Postpartum depression is measured when the child is 6 months of age by the Edinburgh Post-natal Depression scale. Families that failed to enroll in TEDDY are asked to provide reasons for their decision. We also examined those who dropped out of TEDDY within 1 year of recruitment and found several important predictors. TEDDY has also uncovered significant differences between the levels of parental stress and postpartum depression between the U.S. and European societies. 65 In conclusion, the TEDDY Consortium is nearing the final stages of the initial phase of the project, with more than 70% of the screening and 63% of the enrollment goals already achieved. The retention of study participants and compliance remain high despite the very demanding protocol. Preliminary findings point to major inter-population differences in genetic susceptibility and candidate environmental risk factors for T1D.
