Nanophotothermolysis of multiple scattered cancer cells with carbon nanotubes guided by time-resolved infrared thermal imaging Nanophotothermolysis with long laser pulses for treatment of scattered cancer cells and their clusters is introduced with the main focus on real-time monitoring of temperature dynamics inside and around individual cancer cells labeled with carbon nanotubes. This technique utilizes advanced time- and spatially-resolved thermal radiometry imaging for the visualization of laser-induced temperature distribution in multiple-point absorbing targets. The capability of this approach was demonstrated for monitoring of thermal effects under long laser exposure (from millisecond to seconds, wavelength 1064 nm, maximum power 1 W) of cervical cancer HeLa cells labeled with carbon nanotubes in vitro . The applications are discussed with a focus on the nanophotothermolysis of small tumors, tumor margins, or micrometastases under the guidance of near-IR and microwave radiometry.
