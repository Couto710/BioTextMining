Modes of resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy Angiogenesis inhibitors targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling pathways are affording demonstrable therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of cancer and in an increasing number of human cancers. However, in both preclinical and clinical settings, the benefits are at best transitory and are followed by a restoration of tumour growth and progression. Emerging data support a proposition that two modes of unconventional resistance underlie such results: evasive resistance, an adaptation to circumvent the specific angiogenic blockade; and intrinsic or pre-existing indifference. Multiple mechanisms can be invoked in different tumour contexts to manifest both evasive and intrinsic resistance, motivating assessment of their prevalence and importance and in turn the design of pharmacological strategies that confer enduring anti-angiogenic therapies.  Conclusions These considerations, about modes and underlying mechanisms of resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy, present both an agenda for future research and the outlines of a strategy for improving the treatment of human cancer with angiogenesis inhibitors. All of the mechanisms, both of adaptive and of intrinsic resistance, deserve further investigation and rigorous evaluation of their prevalence and significance, both in animal models of cancer and in humans. We also expect that other evasive mechanisms will be uncovered. Additionally, it will be important to clarify the circumstances that elicit particular mechanistic pathways of resistance, alone and in the context of standard-of-care chemotherapy and radiotherapy for different cancer types, recognizing that the likely future of most anti-angiogenic therapies will be in such combinations. The constraints on clinical investigation pose challenges indeed, but we envision that advancing technologies, in non-invasive imaging for example, and in collecting and analysing tumour biopsies to assess histological parameters of response and evasive resistance, will be instrumental. Another challenge is to identify robust biomarkers for tumour angiogenesis and for vascular normalization 93 , as well as for the modes of intrinsic and evasive resistance. As for cancer therapeutics, we foresee several applications of these principles. First and foremost is the emerging role of invasion and metastasis, both in intrinsic and adaptive resistance. The combination of anti-invasive and anti-metastatic drugs with anti-angiogenic drugs would seem to have particular promise. For example, multiple drugs targeting the pro-invasive hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF )– MET and insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF1 ) receptor pathways are in clinical trials 94 , 95 and should be tested in combination with VEGF pathway inhibitors. The HIF regulatory network also holds promise as a target, given its global effects on angiogenesis, invasion and stress-adaptive cell physiology 96 – 99 . Another promising avenue involves multi-targeting of parallel pro-angiogenic signalling circuits, aimed to circumvent pre-existing redundancy or evasive mechanisms involving upregula tion of alternative angiogenic signalling circuits. Drugs targeting such signals (such as FGFs) are entering clinical trials, now aimed in part to assess their impact on evasive resistance to VEGF blockade 100 – 102 . Finally, although the transitory efficacy of the groundbreaking VEGF pathway inhibitors might be construed as disappointing, the results must be considered in the context of the current standards of care for most of the major human cancers, which typically have transitory efficacy, inevitable progression and/or resistance, toxicity and poor quality of life effects. Angiogenesis inhibitors, despite their evident limitations, are an important milestone in cancer therapeutics, where they are becoming components of standard-of-care therapy, for example for colorectal and renal cancers . Moreover, the growing knowledge about their effects and efficacy, and about the existence and mechanistic basis for adaptive evasive resistance and abject failures (intrinsic indifference), presents an exciting future of opportunity for improving and sustaining the benefits of anti-angiogenic therapy.

By contrast, intrinsic non-responsiveness is a pre-existing condition defined by the absence of any (even transitory) beneficial effect of an anti-angiogenic therapy, ranging from the inability to shrink or stabilize tumours to the lack of improvement in quality of life. Consequently tumours grow and progress unabated during the course of anti-angiogenic therapy. VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. Figure 2 Induced pro-angiogenic factor substitution re-establishes tumour neovascularization Activation and/or upregulation of other pro-angiogenic signalling pathways, including those involving members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF), ephrin and angiopoietin families, can circumvent the anti-angiogenic therapy and, in due course, provoke neovascularization and subsequent tumour relapse. Figure 3 Recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells can endorse restored neovascularization Low oxygen conditions in tumours (hypoxia), acting in part through induced increases in hypoxia-inducible factor 1? and its targets stromal cell-derived factor 1? and vascular endothelial growth factor, can attract a heterogeneous population of bone marrow-derived cells consisting of vascular progenitors and pro-angiogenic monocytic cells. Endothelial and pericyte progenitors are incorporated as components of new vessels to directly build new blood vessels, and pro-angiogenic monocytes fuel the tumours with pro-angiogenic cytokines, growth factors and proteases, all of which facilitate neovascularization. Figure 4 Increased pericyte coverage protects tumour blood vessels Although inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor signalling pathways can lead to vessel regression, a few ‘normal-appearing’ slim and functional vessels remain; these vessels are densely and tightly covered with pericytes, and are markedly distinct from the vessels that are seen in tumours of untreated animals, which are typically dilated, tortuous and irregularly shaped, and variably covered with less closely associated pericytes. Such coating by pericytes arguably helps the tumour endothelium to survive and function, and thereby enables tumours to grow (perhaps more slowly) during the course of an anti-angiogenic therapeutic regimen. Figure 5 Increased tumour cell invasiveness to escape oxygen and nutrient deprivation When tumours are not able to satisfactorily reinitiate angiogenesis, tumour cells may invade adjacent normal tissue to achieve vascular sufficiency in a dispersed fashion. Tumour cells can migrate along the outside of blood vessels (perivascu lar invasion), using them as conduits into normal tissue, or infiltrate through the extracellular matrix. In either case they depend on normal vasculature for sustenance.
