Chromosomal instability and cancer: not just one CINgle mechanism  CONCLUSION Thus, we are left with a complex observation. Most CRCs have CIN, and the cancer cell appears to have made a Faustian bargain in which it tolerates a malevolent process that kills many in the colony, but later leads to a dramatic advantage for growth and survival. This paradox offers an opportunity to exploit the weaknesses imposed by CIN. Moreover, in the case of viral oncogenesis, it is tempting to speculate that preventing exposure to the virus—as has already been shown for HPV and cervical cancer—could have a major impact on public health.
