The ART of HIV therapies: dopaminergic deficits and future treatments for HIV pediatric encephalopathy The concerted efforts of clinicians, scientists and caregivers of HIV-infected children have led to tremendous advances in our understanding of pediatric HIV/AIDS. Antiretroviral therapy (ART; formerly known as highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]) has significantly extended the longevity of HIV-infected children, but there are limitations to improvements in quality of life that may persist despite therapy. ART has remarkably reduced the incidence of neurologic deficits for the majority of infected children, but some patients do not experience these benefits and children living in poorer nations, who may not have access to antiretrovirals, are particularly at risk for developing neurologic deficits. This article reviews the neurologic symptoms of pediatric HIV infection that manifest as dopaminergic disruptions and explores potential future adjuvant therapies for HIV-related neurologic disorders in children.  Conclusion The first pediatric case of HIV infection reported to the US CDC occurred in November of 1982 [ 20 ]. Over the past quarter of a century, we have made remarkable advances in our understanding of the methods of HIV transmission, the pathogenesis of the disease and in the development of treatments that have, without a doubt, significantly contributed to the longevity and quality of life of HIV-infected patients. However, it seems obvious that we still have a tremendous amount of work ahead of us. HIV/AIDS researchers are beginning to unravel the unique consequences of the pathogenesis of HIV in the pediatric CNS and recognize that these patients experience a different disease course than adults. In light of the challenges that lie ahead, we hope that, in 5 years time, this review will seem a quaint reminder of the progress made in treating HIV-infected children.
