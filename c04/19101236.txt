Multimorbidity due to Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease and Outcomes in Chronic Heart Failure Diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are common in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) and are associated with poor outcomes. However, the impact of multimorbidity due to DM and CKD on outcomes, relative to comorbidity due to DM alone, has not been well studied in these patients. Of the 7788 patients with chronic HF in the Digitalis Investigation Group trial, 2218 had DM. We categorized these patients into those with DM alone (DM-only; n=1123) and those with both DM and CKD (DM-CKD; n=1095). Propensity scores for DM-CKD, calculated for each of the 2218 patients, were used to match 699 pairs of DM-only and DM-CKD patients. Matched Cox regression models were used to estimate associations between DM-CKD and outcomes. All-cause mortality occurred in 44% (rate, 1648/10000 person-years) of DM-CKD patients and 39% (rate, 1349/10000 person-years of follow-up) of DM-only patients (hazard ratio when DM-CKD was compared with DM-only, 1.34; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.11–1.62; p=0.003). All-cause hospitalization occurred in 76% (rate, 5799/10000 person-years) and 73% (rate, 4909/10000 person-years) of DM-CKD and DM-only patients respectively (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.99–1.36; p=064). Respective hazard ratios (95% CI) for other outcomes were: cardiovascular mortality (1.33; 1.07–1.66; p=0.010), HF mortality (1.41; 1.02–1.96; p=0.040), cardiovascular hospitalization (1.17; 0.99–1.39; p=0.064) and HF hospitalization (1.26; 1.03–1.55; p=0.026). In conclusion, compared to comorbidity due to DM alone, the presence of multimorbidity due to DM and CKD was associated with increased mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic HF.  Methods The DIG was a multicenter randomized clinical trial of digoxin in patients with chronic HF in normal sinus rhythm and receiving ACE inhibitors conducted in the United States and Canada. 5 , 6 Of the7788 DIG participants, 2218 (26%) had a history of DM, of whom 1095 (49%) had CKD. 2 Data on DM were collected at baseline from medical history and CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 body surface area. 4 , 7 , 8 Based on the presence of CKD, we categorized these 2218 patients into DM-only (n=1123) and DM-CKD (n=1095) groups. Our primary outcomes were mortality and hospitalization due to all causes, and secondary outcomes were those due to cardiovascular causes and HF. Data on vital status were known for 99% of DIG participants. 9 To ensure that DM-only and DM-CKD patients would be well-balanced on all measured baseline characteristics, we used a propensity-matched design. 10 – 13 First, we estimated propensity scores for DM-CKD for each of the 2218 patients using a non-parsimonious, multivariate logistic regression model. In that model, DM-CKD was used as the dependent variable and all measured baseline covariates displayed in Figure 1 were used as covariates. 2 , 4 , 14 We then used the propensity scores to match 699 DM-CKD patients with 699 DM-only patients. Post-match covariate balance was objectively assessed by estimating absolute standardized differences and presented as a Love plot, developed by Thomas E. Love, PhD. 15 , 16 We used Kaplan-Meier and matched Cox regression analyses to examine the association of DM-CKD with outcomes, and assessed the homogeneity of this association in various subgroups of patients. Finally, to examine if there was a synergism between DM and CKD in chronic HF, we analyzed the pre-match data, to estimate unadjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality separately for DM, CKD, and DM-CKD, compared with those without DM or CKD. We then assessed additive synergism by comparing the individual effects of DM and CKD with the observed combined effect of DM-CKD. All statistical tests were done using SPSS-15 for Windows. 17  Results Baseline characteristics for both groups before and after matching are displayed in Table 1 . Values of absolute standardized differences for all covariates were <10% (most <5%) after matching, suggesting substantial bias reduction ( Figure 1 ). Of the 1398 patients included in the propensity-matched analysis 582 (42%) patients died from all causes and 1040 (74%) patients were hospitalized for all causes. All-cause mortality occurred in 44% (rate, 1648/10000 person-years) and 39% (rate, 1349/10000 person-years) of DM-CKD and DM-only patients respectively (matched hazard ratio {HR} when DM-CKD was compared with DM-only, 1.34; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.11–1.62; p=0.003; Figure 2a and Table 2 ). The association was homogenous across different subgroups ( Figure 3 ). In the absence of a hidden confounder, a sign-score test for matched data with censoring provides strong evidence (p=0.0027) that DM-CKD was associated with increased mortality. An unmeasured covariate which is a near-perfect predictor of mortality would need to increase the odds of having both DM and CKD by 10.55% to explain away this association. Associations of DM-CKD with cardiovascular and HF mortality are displayed in Table 2 . Analysis of pre-match data did not reveal any additive synergistic interaction between DM and CKD. The unadjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality for patients with neither DM nor CKD, DM only, CKD only and both DM and CKD were respectively 1.00, 1.47, 1.63 and 2.12. Based on these unadjusted hazard ratios, the expected (1 + 0.47 + 0.63 = 2.10) and the observed (2.12) effects of DM-CKD were similar. All-cause hospitalization occurred in 76% (rate, 5799/10000 person-years) of DM-CKD patients, and 73% (rate, 4909/10000 person-years) of DM-only patients (HR when DM-CKD was compared with DM-only, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.99–1.36; p=0.064; Figure 2b and Table 2 ). Associations of DM-CKD with cardiovascular and worsening HF hospitalization are displayed in Table 2 .  Results Baseline characteristics for both groups before and after matching are displayed in Table 1 .

Associations of DM-CKD with cardiovascular and worsening HF hospitalization are displayed in Table 2 .  Discussion Findings from this study demonstrate that among patients with chronic HF, compared with comorbidity due to DM alone, multimorbidity due to DM and CKD was associated with worse prognosis. These findings are important as most HF patients are older adults who suffer from multimorbidity, and DM and CKD are common comorbidities in these patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first propensity-matched study to demonstrate additional prognostic effect of baseline multimorbidity due to DM and CKD compared with comorbidity due to DM alone in patients with chronic HF. There are several potential explanations for our findings: a direct effect of CKD, a confounding effect by one or more of the measured covariates, or a confounding effect by one or more of the unmeasured covariates. The adverse effect of CKD in the population in general, and in HF patients in particular, is well-established. 4 , 18 CKD is associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is also activated in DM and HF. 19 , 20 Even though it is not clearly understood how these three conditions with similar neurohormonal activation interact with each other. Our data suggest that the presence of CKD as an additional comorbidity further increases the risk of death and hospitalization in those with HF and DM. However, findings from our study also suggest that these two comorbidities may exert their negative prognostic effect individually and there may not be any additional synergism between them. The poor prognosis of DM-CKD patients are unlikely to be explained by imbalances in measured baseline covariates as they were all well-balanced in our matched cohort. Results of our sensitivity analysis suggest that our finding of association between DM-CKD and all-cause mortality was relatively insensitive to an unmeasured covariate. There were only 20 extra hospitalizations due to all causes compared with 38 extra deaths in the DM-CKD group compared with the DM-only group ( Table 2 ). This preferential effect of DM-CKD on mortality relative to hospitalization may have been due to sudden cardiac death in those with DM-CKD which may have prevented those patients from being hospitalized. The effect of CKD on mortality was observed in a wide spectrum of chronic HF patients with DM. The significant interaction between race and CKD in these patients is likely a chance finding given the small number of nonwhite patients in our study. A relatively stronger association of CKD with mortality in DIG participants with normal left ventricular ejection fraction has been previously reported. 4 Our study has several limitations. Patients in the DIG trial were younger white men in normal sinus rhythm from the pre-beta-blocker era of HF therapy which may limit the generalizability of these findings to contemporary HF patients. Also, it is possible that patients without CKD at baseline developed CKD during follow up, which could have underestimated the association observed in our study. As in all observational study, we cannot rule out bias due to imbalance in an unmeasured covariate. Our sensitivity analysis indicates that our findings are modestly insensitive to an unmeasured binary covariate that is a near-perfect predictor of mortality. However, sensitivity analysis cannot determine if such a hidden cofounder exists or not. It is important to remember that an unmeasured covariate does not automatically become an unmeasured confounder. To be a confounder, a covariate that is a near-perfect predictor of mortality, is also required to be associated with both DM and CKD, and must not be strongly correlated with any of the covariates used to calculate propensity scores. Despite these limitations, the findings from this first report of a propensity-matched study of multimorbidity highlight the additional burden of CKD in chronic HF patients with DM and underscore the importance of prevention and treatment of comorbidities in chronic HF.
