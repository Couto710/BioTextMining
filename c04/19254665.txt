Melanoma Epidemiology and Public Health Melanoma has presented a conundrum to physicians and prevention researchers. We should be able to reduce incidence and mortality rather easily because evolving melanoma lesions are observable on the surface of the skin. However, melanoma has not proved tractable. The incidence and mortality have risen in all developed countries during the past 50 years. However, mortality appears to be abating among younger cohorts even though the reason for this is not clear.
