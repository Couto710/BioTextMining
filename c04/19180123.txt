Mechanisms of microvascular thrombosis in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura Recent studies have demonstrated that thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a serious thrombotic disorder affecting the arterioles and capillaries of multiple organs, is caused by a profound deficiency in the von Willebrand factor cleaving metalloprotease, ADAMTS13. ADAMTS13, a 190-kD plasma protease originating primarily in hepatic stellate cells, prevents microvascular thrombosis by cleaving von Willebrand factor when the substrate is conformationally unfolded by high levels of shear stress in the circulation. Deficiency of ADAMTS13, due to genetic mutations or inhibitory autoantibodies, leads to accumulation of superactive forms of vWF, resulting in vWF-platelet aggregation and microvascular thrombosis. Analysis of ADAMTS13 has led to the recognition of subclinical TTP and atypical TTP presenting with thrombocytopenia or acute focal neurological deficits without concurrent microangiopathic hemolysis. Infusion of plasma replenishes the missing ADAMTS13 and ameliorates the complications of hereditary TTP. The patients are at risk of both acute and chronic renal failure if they receive inadequate plasma therapy. The more frequent, autoimmune type of TTP requires plasma exchange therapy and perhaps immunomodulatory measures. Current studies focus on the factors affecting the phenotypic severity of TTP and newer approaches to improving the therapies for the patients.
