Crystal structure of metastasis-associated protein S100A4 in the active, calcium-bound form Summary S100A4 (metastasin) is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins that is directly involved in tumorgenesis. Until recently, the only structural information available was the solution NMR structure of the inactive, calcium-free form of the protein. Here we report the crystal structure of human S100A4 in the active, calcium-bound state at 2.03 Å resolution that was solved by molecular replacement in the space group P 65 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit from perfectly merohedrally twinned crystals. The Ca2+-bound S100A4 structure reveals a large conformational change in the three-dimensional structure of the dimeric S100A4 protein upon calcium binding. This calcium-dependent conformational change opens up a hydrophobic binding pocket that is capable of binding to target proteins such as annexin A2, the p53 tumor suppressor protein, and myosin IIA. The structure of the active form of S100A4 provides insight into its interactions with its binding partners and a better understanding on its role in metastasis.  Materials and Methods Expression and purification The pET23a-human S100A4 expression construct was kindly provided by Dr. David J. Weber, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Maryland, USA and Dr. Anne R. Bresnick, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, USA. The recombinant plasmid pET23a-S100A4 was expressed in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells (Novagen, San Diego, CA, USA). Cells grown from an overnight pre-culture incubated at 37 °C were grown in 1 l Luria-Bertani (LB) broth medium containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. At an optical density of 0.8 at 600 nm, the cells were induced with 1 mM isopropyl ?-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 37 °C. The cells were harvested 4 h after induction by centrifugation at 6000 g for 15 min at 4 °C, then frozen and stored at ?20 °C until lysis. Cell pellets from 6 l of culture were resuspended in 150 ml of lysis buffer [50 mM imidazole-HCl pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), containing a protease inhibitor cocktail [20 µg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mM benzamidine and 10 µM trans -epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane (E-64)]. Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 100 µg/ml and the resuspended cells were lysed using a French Press. The lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove cell debris and denatured protein. The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A [10 mM imidazole-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM NaN3 and 1 mM PMSF]. Human S100A4 was purified using ion-exchange chromatography and all purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The supernatant was first applied to a 200 ml bed volume DEAE Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA) preequilibrated with buffer A. Unbound protein was removed by washing the column with 200 ml of buffer A and the S100A4 protein was eluted in buffer B (10 mM imidazole-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM NaN3 and 1 mM PMSF). Fractions containing S100A4 were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C (50 mM MES-NaOH pH 5.6 and 1 mM dithiothreitol) and applied to a 200 ml bed volume MonoS cation-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA) pre-equilibrated with buffer C. The column was washed with 200 ml of buffer C to remove any unbound protein and S100A4 was eluted in 50 mM MES-NaOH pH 5.6, 350 mM NaCl and 1 mM dithiothreitol using a 50–500 mM NaCl step gradient composed of 50 mM steps. Fractions containing S100A4 were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mM MES-NaOH pH 5.6, 250 mM NaCl, 100 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM dithiothreitol in order to obtain Ca2+-bound crystals of human S100A4. Prior to crystallization S100A4 was concentrated to 20 mg/ml via ultrafiltration using a 10 kDa cutoff ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA). The purity of the sample during each purification step was confirmed using 15% ( w/v ) SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Crystallization and data collection Crystallization screens were set up using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method 61 by mixing 2 µl of protein solution with 2 µl of precipitant solution over wells containing 1 ml of precipitant solution in EasyXtal Tool plates from Nextal Biotechnologies (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Crystallization conditions were obtained in 20% ( w/v ) PEG 3350 and 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5 at 22 °C. This condition was optimized to improve the quality of the crystals by using isopropanol as an additive and using various protein concentrations. The best crystals grew in three days at 22 °C by mixing 1.5 µl of protein solution (20 mg/ml) with 2 µl of precipitant solution (20% ( w/v ) PEG 3350, 10% ( v/v ) isopropanol and 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5); the maximum dimensions of the crystals were 70 × 70 × 90 µm. Prior to data collection, Ca2+-bound S100A4 crystals were soaked for a few seconds in the crystallization solution containing 30% ( v/v ) glycerol as a cryo-protectant before being flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected on beamline 9-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) using remote robotic data collection at a wavelength of 0.979 Å. The detector was an Area Detector Systems Corporation (ADSC) Q315 CCD detector. A total of 180 frames of 1° oscillation range and an exposure time of 30 s per frame were collected from a single crystal. The images were processed to 2.03 Å in spacegroups P 65 and P 6522 with the program HKL2000. 62 Data-collection statistics are summarized in Table 1 . Structure determination and refinement Molecular replacement was carried using PHASER 63 using the Ca2+-bound S100A6 structure (PDB code: 1K96, 46% sequence identity) as the search model. 13 The calcium ions were removed from the search model prior to molecular replacement. Due to the presence of strong merohedral twinning, SHELX-97 was used for crystallographic refinement (TWIN and BASF options). 46 In order to avoid bias due to the presence of the twinning operator the R free test reflections were selected to include all reflection (twin pairs) from several thin resolution shells. During each step of the refinement, twenty conjugate-gradient cycles were performed and after several rounds of refinement and manual model-building using the program Coot 64 , water molecules were added using SHELX-97 (SHELXWAT option). Final refinement statistics for Ca2+-bound S100A4 are listed in Table 1 . Detection of merohedral twinning Merohedral twinning analysis was attempted using the Merohedral Twin Detector: Padilla-Yeates Algorithm available at http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/pystats/ and the Merohedral Crystal Twinning Server available at http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/Twinning . 43 ; 44 Twinning analysis was also performed using the program TRUNCATE from CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). 41 Cumulative intensity distribution plots and the second moment of I were examined in TRUNCATE. The program Xtriage was used to analyze the structure factor data for the presence of twinning. 47 The twinning fraction was refined with the program SHELXL-97. 46  Expression and purification The pET23a-human S100A4 expression construct was kindly provided by Dr. David J.

Conclusions We have solved the crystal structure of the active, Ca2+-bound S100A4 (metastasin) from perfectly merohedrally twinned crystals. The structure of active S100A4 reveals a dramatic conformational change that opens up two symmetrically positioned target binding sites that are buried in the apo S100A4 structure. Based on the structural information we have gained from Ca2+-bound S100A4 we propose a model of calcium induced target binding to annexin A2 and how this interaction may contribute to S100A4’s role in metastasis and angiogenesis. Although conventional twinning servers and analysis programs did not detect twinning, refinement of the Ca2+-bound S100A4 structure was only successful after including a twinning operator and a twin fraction of 0.5. We believe that conventional twinning servers failed to detect twinning because NCS masked the twinning operator, a phenomenon that has been previously reported. 45
