Common genetic variants on 5p14.1 associate with autism spectrum disorders Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a group of childhood neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by deficits in verbal communication, impairment of social interaction, and restricted and repetitive patterns of interests and behaviour. To identify common genetic risk factors underlying ASDs, here we present the results of genome-wide association studies on a cohort of 780 families (3,101 subjects) with affected children, and a second cohort of 1,204 affected subjects and 6,491 control subjects, all of whom were of European ancestry. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms between cadherin 10 ( CDH10 ) and cadherin 9 ( CDH9 )—two genes encoding neuronal cell-adhesion molecules—revealed strong association signals, with the most significant SNP being rs4307059 ( P = 3.4 × 10?8, odds ratio = 1.19). These signals were replicated in two independent cohorts, with combined P values ranging from 7.4 × 10?8 to 2.1 × 10?10. Our results implicate neuronal cell-adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of ASDs, and represent, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of genome-wide significant association of common variants with susceptibility to ASDs.  METHODS SUMMARY All genome-wide SNP genotyping for the discovery cohorts was performed using the Illumina HumanHap550 BeadChip at the Center for Applied Genomics at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. For family-based cohorts, the association tests for markers in autosomes and pseudoautosomal region of sex chromosomes were performed by PDT, whereas tests for markers in the X chromosome were performed by X-APL. For case-control cohorts, the association tests were performed by PLINK ( http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/ ). Pathway association analysis was performed by GenGen ( http://www.openbioinformatics.org/gengen/ ), using the genotype data. The whole-genome genotype imputation was performed by MACH ( http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MaCH/ ) on the autosomal markers, on the basis of phased haplotypes (release 22) for the HapMap CEU population ( http://ftp.hapmap.org/phasing/2007-08_rel22/ ). We removed all markers with MACH Rsq measure of less than 0.3, and zeroed out imputed genotypes with a posterior probability of less than 0.9. The case-control association tests for imputed genotypes were performed by SNPTEST ( http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~marchini/software/gwas/snptest.html ), which can handle genotype imputation uncertainty. CNV calls were generated by PennCNV ( http://www. openbioinformatics.org/penncnv/ ) on genotyping signal intensity data. For CNV validation by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), we used the Universal Probe Library system from Roche, and all reactions were performed in triplicate with an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). For CNV validation by quantitative PCR (qPCR), TaqMan probes were custom-designed using Primer Express 3.0 (Applied Biosystems). For in situ hybridization, multiple sagittally sectioned human fetal brains were obtained from the Developmental Brain and Tissue Bank at the University of Maryland. Riboprobes against CDH9 or CDH10 were used for hybridization. The SNPExpress database and software ( http://people. genome.duke.edu/~dg48/SNPExpress/ ) were used to examine the genotype-expression relationships.

Discussion Besides recent genetic findings supporting the role of neuronal cell-adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of autism, an increasing number of functional neuroimaging studies have suggested the presence of cortical underconnectivity in subjects with ASDs 44 , 45 . Furthermore, neuroanatomy studies have implicated abnormal brain development of the frontal lobes in autism 46 , 47 . The genetic findings, when coupled with anatomical and functional imaging studies, convergently indicate that ASDs may result from structural and functional disconnection of brain regions that are involved in higher-order associations 48 - 50 , suggesting that ASDs may represent a neuronal disconnection syndrome. In the current study, we have completed a genetic analysis in a large number of ASD cases and families, with a combined sample set of more than 10,000 subjects of European ancestry. We have identified and replicated common genetic variants on 5p14.1 that are associated with susceptibility to ASDs. Besides the potential roles of the nearby CDH10 and CDH9 genes, pathway-based association analysis lend further support to neuronal cell-adhesion molecules in conferring susceptibility to ASDs, suggesting that specific genetic variants in this gene class may be involved in shaping the physical structure and functional connectivity of the brain, that leads to the clinical manifestations of ASDs. Apart from highlighting the genetic complexity of ASDs and the need for large sample sizes in unveiling their genetic causes, our study represents a successful application of the genome-wide association approach in identifying common susceptibility alleles, as part of a larger effort to interrogate the complex genetic architecture of ASDs. Because the genetic aetiologies of ASDs may be linked to the neurobiological components that build and modify connectivity of the brain, by comprehensively identifying the relevant genes, genomic variants and genetic pathways, more focused analysis on gene expression, as well as structural and functional imaging, can be performed on subjects carrying specific genetic defects. Together with studies addressing epigenetic modifications and comprehensive analysis of environmental risk factors, these pieces of information can be better integrated to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of ASDs, and foster the development of early preventive and corrective strategies.
