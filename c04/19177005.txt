PI3K/mTORC1 activation in hamartoma syndromes Therapeutic prospects Dysregulated activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is characteristic feature of hamartoma syndromes. Hamartoma syndromes, dominantly inherited cancer predisposition disorders, affect multiple organs and are manifested by benign tumors consisting of various cell types native to the tissues in which they arise. In the past few years, three inherited hamartoma syndromes, Cowden syndrome (CS), tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) syndrome, and Peutz-Jeghens syndrome (PJS), have all been linked to a common biochemical pathway: the hyperactivation of PI3K/mTORC1 intracellular signaling. Three tumor suppressors, PTEN ( p hosphatases and ten sin homolog), tuberous sclerosis complex TSC1/TSC2, and LKB1, are negative regulators of PI3K/mTORC1 signaling; disease-related inactivation of these tumor suppressors results in the development of PTEN-associated hamartoma syndromes, TSC and PJS, respectively. The goal of this review is to provide a roadmap for navigating the inherently complex regulation of PI3K/mTORC1 signaling while highlighting the progress that has been made in elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of hamartoma syndromes and identificating potential therapeutic targets for their treatment. Importantly, because the PI3K/mTORC1 pathway is activated in the majority of common human cancers, the identification of novel molecular target(s) for the treatment of hamartoma syndromes may have a broader translational potential, and is critically important not only for therapeutic intervention in hamartoma disorders, but also for the treatment of cancers.  Conclusion The activation of mTORC1 signaling due to loss of function of tumor suppressors PTEN, TSC1/TSC2 and LKB1 in PTEN-related hamartoma syndromes, TSC and PJS make mTORC1 an optimal target for therapy. Clinical trials testing the anti-tumor activity of rapamycin analogs, which specifically inhibit mTORC1 signaling, in patients with TSC/LAM and PTEN-deficient glioblastoma demonstrate promising treatment benefits. These studies also demonstrated the limitations of single drug targeting of mTORC1 with rapamycin, indicating that combinational therapy is required for significant clinical impact. Current developments in specific targeting of PI3K and dual targeting of PI3K and mTORC1 indicate greater promise in finding and developing effective therapy for hamartoma syndromes
