Genetics: Breast Cancer as an Exemplar Synopsis Genetic testing for adult onset diseases is now available. One such test is for the mutations present in the BRCA gene which result in a significantly higher risk for the development of breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer. Women who have one of these mutations face difficult choices in terms of increased surveillance and/or prophylactic surgeries. Examining experiences of women with BRCA mutations can serve as an exemplar for other populations at risk for genetically associated adult onset diseases.
