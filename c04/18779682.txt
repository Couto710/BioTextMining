Menopause, the metabolic syndrome, and mind-body therapies Cardiovascular disease risk rises sharply with menopause, likely due to the coincident increase in insulin resistance and related atherogenic changes that together comprise the metabolic or insulin resistance syndrome, a cluster of metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities strongly implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease. A growing body of research suggests that traditional mind-body practices such as yoga, tai chi, and qigong may offer safe and cost-effective strategies for reducing insulin resistance syndrome-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease in older populations, including postmenopausal women. Current evidence suggests that these practices may reduce insulin resistance and related physiological risk factors for cardiovascular disease; improve mood, well-being, and sleep; decrease sympathetic activation; and enhance cardiovagal function. However, additional rigorous studies are needed to confirm existing findings and to examine long-term effects on cardiovascular health.  CONCLUSIONS CVD risk rises sharply with menopause, likely due to the coincident increase in insulin resistance and related atherogenic changes that together comprise IRS, a cluster of metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities strongly implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of CVD. There is growing evidence that traditional mind-body practices such as yoga, tai chi, and qigong may offer safe and cost-effective strategies for reducing IRS-related risk factors for CVD in older populations, including postmenopausal women. However, additional rigorous studies are needed to confirm existing findings and to examine long-term effects on cardiovascular health.
