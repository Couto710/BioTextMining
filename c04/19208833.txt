Reactivation of suppressed RhoB is a critical step for inhibition of anaplastic thyroid cancer growth Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a highly aggressive form of the disease for which new therapeutic options are desperately needed. Previously, we showed that the high affinity PPAR? agonist, RS5444, inhibits cell proliferation of ATC cells via induction of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21). We show here that upregulation of RhoB is a critical step in PPAR?-mediated activation of p21-induced cell stasis. Using multiple, independently derived ATC cell lines, we find that treatment with RS5444 leads to upregulation of RhoB and subsequent activation of p21, and that silencing of RhoB by RNAi blocks the ability of RS5444 to induce p21 and to inhibit cell proliferation. Our results show that transcriptional regulation of RhoB by the nuclear transcription factor PPAR? is responsible for induction of p21 mRNA and protein. We further implicate RhoB as a key signaling effector for growth inhibition of ATC, as treatment with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor previously shown to increase RhoB expression in lung cancer cells caused upregulation of RhoB in ATC cells, accompanied by increased expression of p21 and inhibition of cell proliferation; this effect occurred even in ATC cells that are unresponsive to RS5444 due to lack of expression of PPAR?. Our results implicate RhoB as a novel intermediate in critical signaling pathways and as an additional target for therapeutic intervention in ATC.  Introduction Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer with an approximate incidence rate of 33,550 newly diagnosed cases per year in the U.S ( 1 ). Despite a generally good prognosis, over 1,500 thyroid cancer patients die of their disease annually. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is the most poorly differentiated, highly aggressive form of thyroid cancer with a median survival of about four months, a one year survival rate of less than 10%, and 99% lethality overall. If detected early, extensive surgery combined with radiotherapy offers the best chance of local disease control. To date, chemotherapy (usually doxorubicin plus cisplatin or paclitaxel) has shown only palliative benefit in advanced ATC [reviewed in ( 2 )], but neither agent has demonstrated curative potential. More effective targeted therapies based on a better understanding of the molecular and cellular signaling pathways disrupted in ATC are therefore needed. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR?) agonists have chemopreventive and antitumor activity against a variety of human cancers associated with transcriptional activation of PPAR? ( 3 - 6 ) . These findings are in keeping with the hypothesis that PPAR? can act as a tumor suppressor in several cancers including thyroid cancer ( 7 , 8 ). Mechanisms of PPAR?-mediated antitumor activity include induction of differentiation, promotion of cell cycle arrest, antiangiogenic effects and induction of apoptosis ( 9 ). In more differentiated thyroid cancers, PPAR? agonists have been shown to induce apoptosis through cytochrome C/caspase 3 and PTEN-Akt pathways ( 10 ). We and others have recently demonstrated that the PPAR? agonist RS5444 inhibits cell proliferation and induces tumor differentiation ( 9 , 11 , 12 ). In our previous work, we found that RS5444 inhibited ATC tumor growth in vitro and in vivo but did not induce apoptosis as a single agent ( 9 ). We showed that RS5444 is dependent upon PPAR? for its antitumor activity since GW9662, a pharmacological antagonist of PPAR?, blocked inhibition of cell growth by RS5444 ( 9 ). We also found that the cyclin kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 (p21) was upregulated by RS5444. To date, p21 has been implicated as a modulator of PPAR?-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation, but this evidence has been limited to correlative observations ( 13 - 16 ). In our recent study, we found that p21 was required for PPAR?-mediated growth inhibition by RS5444 in ATC cells, and that combinatorial treatment of ATC cells with RS5444 and paclitaxel resulted in apoptotic synergy. Silencing experiments demonstrated the requirement of p21 for this observed synergy ( 9 ), but the mechanism by which PPAR? agonists might upregulate p21 remained unknown. RhoB is a member of the Ras superfamily of isoprenylated small GTPases, which regulate actin stress fibers and vesicle transport ( 17 , 18 ). Membrane association of RhoB occurs through either geranylgeranylated (RhoB-GG) or farnesylated (RhoB-F) modifications. RhoB is required for apoptosis in transformed cells that are exposed to farnesyltransferase inhibitors, DNA-damaging agents or paclitaxel ( 19 ). In cancer cells, RhoB modulates proliferation, survival, invasion and angiogenic capacity ( 17 ). RhoB is not mutated in cancer, but its altered expression and activity appear crucial to cancer progression and therapeutic responses. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTI) upregulate RhoB levels and this upregulation of RhoB can mediate phenotypic reversion, growth inhibition, cytoskeletal actin reorganization and apoptosis ( 20 ). We now define a sequential pathway whereby the thiazolidinedione (Tzd) RS5444 acts via a PPAR?-dependent mechanism to upregulate RhoB leading to increased expression of p21 followed by attenuation of cell proliferation. The elaboration of this novel signaling pathway triggered by PPAR? agonists provides insight into how to target such agents for treatment of ATC. We now demonstrate that the high-affinity HDAC inhibitor, FK228 (a.k.a. romidepsin), previously shown to stimulate RhoB expression in lung cancer cell lines ( 21 ), also inhibits ATC cell proliferation via p21 in a RhoB-dependent fashion. These results identify RhoB upregulation as a key step for targeting ATC cell proliferation and tumor progression.

Media was collected and TX-100 samples were serially diluted as standards for cell death percentage. Media was plated and incubated with LDH (Thermoelectron) at 1:10 for 30 minutes in the dark and then the absorbance was read at 340 nm on a Spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices).

Results Regulation of cell proliferation by RS5444 is PPAR?-dependent We previously demonstrated that DRO cells were growth inhibited by 10 nM RS5444 through a PPAR?-dependent mechanism ( 9 ). We now confirm and extend this finding to four human cell lines (DRO, ARO, KTC2 and KTC3) that have been engineered to stably express lentiviral shRNA against PPAR? ( Figure 1A ). Cells silenced for PPAR? expression (PPAR? shRNA) expressed little or no PPAR? as compared to nontarget lentiviral shRNA control cells ( Figure 1B ). Cells were then tested for transcriptional response to PPAR? by transient transfection of PPRE-tk-luciferase as a transcriptional reporter for PPAR? and showed loss of transcriptional response to 10 nM RS5444 ( Figure 1C ). These results show that PPAR?-induced growth inhibition is a general property of ATC cells. PPAR? agonists upregulate RhoB expression, which is dependent upon PPAR? We observed altered cellular morphology following treatment with 10 nM RS5444 ( Figure 2A ), which led us to examine the potential involvement of members of the RhoGTPase family of small GTPases, as these are known to play roles in regulating the actin cytoskeleton ( 17 ). Since the primary effects of PPAR? are at the level of transcriptional regulation of target genes, we used Real Time PCR to rapidly screen for changes in mRNA levels of the members of the RhoGTPase family, and found that RS5444 consistently upregulated RhoB expression in all four cell lines examined ( Figure 2A ). Upregulation of RhoB protein was demonstrated in DRO and KTC2 cells treated for 24 hr with 10 nM RS5444 or two related Tzd PPAR? agonists, 100 nM rosiglitazone and 1 ?M troglitazone ( Figure 2B ). These effects were confirmed to be dependent upon PPAR?, as pretreatment of cells with 10 M GW9662, an irreversible pharmacological inhibitor of PPAR?, blocked induction of RhoB ( Figure 2B ), as did shRNA silencing of PPAR? ( Figure 2C ). We also investigated these effects in mouse xenograft models where we previously identified tumor growth inhibition of established tumors and upregulation of p21 as a result of 0.025% RS5444 treatment ( 9 ), and found that RhoB expression was strongly upregulated in DRO and ARO tumors excised from mice chronically treated with 0.025% RS5444 in the diet for 4 wks ( Figure 2D ). We confirmed this finding in an ATC cell line (THJ-11T) created in our laboratory ( Figure 2D ). These results demonstrate that increased expression of RhoB is a general response to activation of PPAR? in ATC cells. RS5444 growth arrest is mediated via RhoB As RhoB has been shown to possess antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity in other types of cancer cells ( 26 ), we assessed the role of RhoB in the inhibition of ATC cell growth by PPAR? ( Figure 3 ). Cells transfected with scrambled siRNA respond to 10 nM RS5444 with upregulation of RhoB protein ( Figure 3A ). Cells transfected with RhoB siRNA and treated with RS5444 showed RhoB levels similar to that of scrambled untreated controls ( Figure 3A ). Silencing RhoB expression revealed that all four lines were RhoB-dependent for RS5444 induced growth arrest ( Figure 3B ). Scrambled siRNA treated cells were growth inhibited by 70 ? 80% after exposure to 10 nM RS5444 over 6 days with media changes and addition of 10 nM RS5444 every 48 hr ( Figure 3B ). Conversely, cells silenced for RhoB expression showed significantly less growth inhibition when exposed to RS5444 ( Figure 3B ). These results show that RhoB is an essential intermediate in PPAR?-mediated growth inhibition of ATC cells. p21 upregulation is RhoB-dependent We previously discovered that RS5444 upregulated p21 protein levels in a PPAR?-dependent fashion and that growth arrest was p21-dependent ( 9 ). Here, we tested whether the induction of p21 by RS5444 was dependent upon RhoB. We confirmed in all four cell lines that a 24 hr treatment with 10 nM RS5444 upregulates p21 mRNA and protein ( Figure 4A ). These events were rapid since RhoB mRNA levels in DRO cells were elevated 2-fold by 2 hrs and were higher than 8-fold by 24 hrs post RS5444 treatment compared to that of time-matched vehicle controls ( Figure 4B ); p21 mRNA levels were elevated 2-fold at 4 hrs post RS5444 treatment and 7-fold at 24 hrs compared to that of controls ( Figure 4C ) indicating that RS5444 transcriptionally upregulates RhoB and p21. RhoB protein levels are elevated by 4 hrs while p21 is elevated by 6 hrs, and remain elevated through 48 hrs after a single treatment of RS5444 in DRO cells ( Figure 4D ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that RhoB mRNA and protein are upregulated by RS5444 before that of p21, suggesting that increased expression of RhoB is upstream of p21 upregulation. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that silencing RhoB in DRO and KTC2 cells significantly blocked upregulation of p21 mRNA by RS5444 ( Figure 5A ). Similarly, expression of dominant negative RhoB also blocked RS5444-induced upregulation of p21 mRNA ( Figure 5B ). We next evaluated the effect of RhoB silencing on protein expression levels of RhoB, p21, and RhoA ( Figure 5C ). We found that silencing RhoB had no effect upon protein expression for RhoA, demonstrating siRNA specificity and that stimulation with RS5444 in scrambled siRNA transfected cells demonstrated upregulation of RhoB and p21 protein ( Figure 5C ). Moreover, we found that RhoB siRNA inhibited the induction of p21 protein levels by RS5444. These results demonstrate that RhoB is necessary for p21 mRNA and protein upregulation by RS5444 ( Figure 5C ). HDAC inhibitor FK228 also upregulates RhoB Our results showed that increased expression of RhoB is an essential upstream step for PPAR?/p21-dependent inhibition of ATC proliferation, and in doing so, we identified RhoB as a novel point of therapeutic intervention in ATC. We next wished to test whether this information could be used to identify PPAR?-independent therapeutic approaches for targeting ATC. Previous investigators found that histone deacetylases (HDACs) suppress RhoB expression in human nonsmall lung carcinoma cell lines and that HDAC inhibitors upregulate RhoB ( 21 , 27 ).We found that KTC3 cells transfected with scrambled or 3 different RhoB siRNAs showed RhoB siRNA 4 almost completely inhibited the pan-HDAC inhibitor, FK228, from inducing RhoB mRNA while RhoB siRNA 3 demonstrated modest inhibition and RhoB siRNA 1 demonstrated no inhibition ( Figure S1 ). Cell proliferation of KTC3 cells using these same siRNAs illustrated differential growth effects when treated with 1 ng/ml FK228 based upon the ability of the siRNA to silence RhoB ( Figure S1 ). Using scrambled siRNA, cells respond to FK228 with upregulation of RhoB and p21 protein while cells transfected with RhoB siRNA 4 demonstrate silenced RhoB and lack of p21 upregulation in response to FK228 ( Figure 6A ), and that knockdown of RhoB significantly inhibited FK228 induced growth arrest ( Figure 6B ). These results suggest that HDAC inhibitor-based therapies could be effective against ATC that are unresponsive to PPAR? agonists. To test this possibility, we evaluated the response to FK228 in THJ-16T cells, which is a cell line derived from a primary ATC tumor in our laboratory. THJ-16T cells express no PPAR? and do not show upregulation of RhoB or inhibition of cell proliferation in response to RS5444 ( Figures 6C ). However, THJ-16T cells do show upregulation of RhoB and p21 in response to FK228 and silencing of RhoB expression attenuates FK228-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation ( Figure 6C ).  Results Regulation of cell proliferation by RS5444 is PPAR?-dependent We previously demonstrated that DRO cells were growth inhibited by 10 nM RS5444 through a PPAR?-dependent mechanism ( 9 ).

These results demonstrate that increased expression of RhoB is a general response to activation of PPAR? in ATC cells. RS5444 growth arrest is mediated via RhoB As RhoB has been shown to possess antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity in other types of cancer cells ( 26 ), we assessed the role of RhoB in the inhibition of ATC cell growth by PPAR? ( Figure 3 ). Cells transfected with scrambled siRNA respond to 10 nM RS5444 with upregulation of RhoB protein ( Figure 3A ). Cells transfected with RhoB siRNA and treated with RS5444 showed RhoB levels similar to that of scrambled untreated controls ( Figure 3A ). Silencing RhoB expression revealed that all four lines were RhoB-dependent for RS5444 induced growth arrest ( Figure 3B ). Scrambled siRNA treated cells were growth inhibited by 70 ? 80% after exposure to 10 nM RS5444 over 6 days with media changes and addition of 10 nM RS5444 every 48 hr ( Figure 3B ). Conversely, cells silenced for RhoB expression showed significantly less growth inhibition when exposed to RS5444 ( Figure 3B ). These results show that RhoB is an essential intermediate in PPAR?-mediated growth inhibition of ATC cells. p21 upregulation is RhoB-dependent We previously discovered that RS5444 upregulated p21 protein levels in a PPAR?-dependent fashion and that growth arrest was p21-dependent ( 9 ). Here, we tested whether the induction of p21 by RS5444 was dependent upon RhoB. We confirmed in all four cell lines that a 24 hr treatment with 10 nM RS5444 upregulates p21 mRNA and protein ( Figure 4A ). These events were rapid since RhoB mRNA levels in DRO cells were elevated 2-fold by 2 hrs and were higher than 8-fold by 24 hrs post RS5444 treatment compared to that of time-matched vehicle controls ( Figure 4B ); p21 mRNA levels were elevated 2-fold at 4 hrs post RS5444 treatment and 7-fold at 24 hrs compared to that of controls ( Figure 4C ) indicating that RS5444 transcriptionally upregulates RhoB and p21. RhoB protein levels are elevated by 4 hrs while p21 is elevated by 6 hrs, and remain elevated through 48 hrs after a single treatment of RS5444 in DRO cells ( Figure 4D ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that RhoB mRNA and protein are upregulated by RS5444 before that of p21, suggesting that increased expression of RhoB is upstream of p21 upregulation. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that silencing RhoB in DRO and KTC2 cells significantly blocked upregulation of p21 mRNA by RS5444 ( Figure 5A ). Similarly, expression of dominant negative RhoB also blocked RS5444-induced upregulation of p21 mRNA ( Figure 5B ). We next evaluated the effect of RhoB silencing on protein expression levels of RhoB, p21, and RhoA ( Figure 5C ). We found that silencing RhoB had no effect upon protein expression for RhoA, demonstrating siRNA specificity and that stimulation with RS5444 in scrambled siRNA transfected cells demonstrated upregulation of RhoB and p21 protein ( Figure 5C ). Moreover, we found that RhoB siRNA inhibited the induction of p21 protein levels by RS5444. These results demonstrate that RhoB is necessary for p21 mRNA and protein upregulation by RS5444 ( Figure 5C ). HDAC inhibitor FK228 also upregulates RhoB Our results showed that increased expression of RhoB is an essential upstream step for PPAR?/p21-dependent inhibition of ATC proliferation, and in doing so, we identified RhoB as a novel point of therapeutic intervention in ATC. We next wished to test whether this information could be used to identify PPAR?-independent therapeutic approaches for targeting ATC. Previous investigators found that histone deacetylases (HDACs) suppress RhoB expression in human nonsmall lung carcinoma cell lines and that HDAC inhibitors upregulate RhoB ( 21 , 27 ).We found that KTC3 cells transfected with scrambled or 3 different RhoB siRNAs showed RhoB siRNA 4 almost completely inhibited the pan-HDAC inhibitor, FK228, from inducing RhoB mRNA while RhoB siRNA 3 demonstrated modest inhibition and RhoB siRNA 1 demonstrated no inhibition ( Figure S1 ). Cell proliferation of KTC3 cells using these same siRNAs illustrated differential growth effects when treated with 1 ng/ml FK228 based upon the ability of the siRNA to silence RhoB ( Figure S1 ). Using scrambled siRNA, cells respond to FK228 with upregulation of RhoB and p21 protein while cells transfected with RhoB siRNA 4 demonstrate silenced RhoB and lack of p21 upregulation in response to FK228 ( Figure 6A ), and that knockdown of RhoB significantly inhibited FK228 induced growth arrest ( Figure 6B ). These results suggest that HDAC inhibitor-based therapies could be effective against ATC that are unresponsive to PPAR? agonists. To test this possibility, we evaluated the response to FK228 in THJ-16T cells, which is a cell line derived from a primary ATC tumor in our laboratory. THJ-16T cells express no PPAR? and do not show upregulation of RhoB or inhibition of cell proliferation in response to RS5444 ( Figures 6C ). However, THJ-16T cells do show upregulation of RhoB and p21 in response to FK228 and silencing of RhoB expression attenuates FK228-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation ( Figure 6C ).  Regulation of cell proliferation by RS5444 is PPAR?-dependent We previously demonstrated that DRO cells were growth inhibited by 10 nM RS5444 through a PPAR?-dependent mechanism ( 9 ). We now confirm and extend this finding to four human cell lines (DRO, ARO, KTC2 and KTC3) that have been engineered to stably express lentiviral shRNA against PPAR? ( Figure 1A ). Cells silenced for PPAR? expression (PPAR? shRNA) expressed little or no PPAR? as compared to nontarget lentiviral shRNA control cells ( Figure 1B ). Cells were then tested for transcriptional response to PPAR? by transient transfection of PPRE-tk-luciferase as a transcriptional reporter for PPAR? and showed loss of transcriptional response to 10 nM RS5444 ( Figure 1C ). These results show that PPAR?-induced growth inhibition is a general property of ATC cells.  Regulation of cell proliferation by RS5444 is PPAR?-dependent We previously demonstrated that DRO cells were growth inhibited by 10 nM RS5444 through a PPAR?-dependent mechanism ( 9 ). We now confirm and extend this finding to four human cell lines (DRO, ARO, KTC2 and KTC3) that have been engineered to stably express lentiviral shRNA against PPAR? ( Figure 1A ).

These results show that PPAR?-induced growth inhibition is a general property of ATC cells.  PPAR? agonists upregulate RhoB expression, which is dependent upon PPAR? We observed altered cellular morphology following treatment with 10 nM RS5444 ( Figure 2A ), which led us to examine the potential involvement of members of the RhoGTPase family of small GTPases, as these are known to play roles in regulating the actin cytoskeleton ( 17 ). Since the primary effects of PPAR? are at the level of transcriptional regulation of target genes, we used Real Time PCR to rapidly screen for changes in mRNA levels of the members of the RhoGTPase family, and found that RS5444 consistently upregulated RhoB expression in all four cell lines examined ( Figure 2A ). Upregulation of RhoB protein was demonstrated in DRO and KTC2 cells treated for 24 hr with 10 nM RS5444 or two related Tzd PPAR? agonists, 100 nM rosiglitazone and 1 ?M troglitazone ( Figure 2B ). These effects were confirmed to be dependent upon PPAR?, as pretreatment of cells with 10 M GW9662, an irreversible pharmacological inhibitor of PPAR?, blocked induction of RhoB ( Figure 2B ), as did shRNA silencing of PPAR? ( Figure 2C ). We also investigated these effects in mouse xenograft models where we previously identified tumor growth inhibition of established tumors and upregulation of p21 as a result of 0.025% RS5444 treatment ( 9 ), and found that RhoB expression was strongly upregulated in DRO and ARO tumors excised from mice chronically treated with 0.025% RS5444 in the diet for 4 wks ( Figure 2D ). We confirmed this finding in an ATC cell line (THJ-11T) created in our laboratory ( Figure 2D ).

We next evaluated the effect of RhoB silencing on protein expression levels of RhoB, p21, and RhoA ( Figure 5C ).

HDAC inhibitor FK228 also upregulates RhoB Our results showed that increased expression of RhoB is an essential upstream step for PPAR?/p21-dependent inhibition of ATC proliferation, and in doing so, we identified RhoB as a novel point of therapeutic intervention in ATC. We next wished to test whether this information could be used to identify PPAR?-independent therapeutic approaches for targeting ATC. Previous investigators found that histone deacetylases (HDACs) suppress RhoB expression in human nonsmall lung carcinoma cell lines and that HDAC inhibitors upregulate RhoB ( 21 , 27 ).We found that KTC3 cells transfected with scrambled or 3 different RhoB siRNAs showed RhoB siRNA 4 almost completely inhibited the pan-HDAC inhibitor, FK228, from inducing RhoB mRNA while RhoB siRNA 3 demonstrated modest inhibition and RhoB siRNA 1 demonstrated no inhibition ( Figure S1 ). Cell proliferation of KTC3 cells using these same siRNAs illustrated differential growth effects when treated with 1 ng/ml FK228 based upon the ability of the siRNA to silence RhoB ( Figure S1 ). Using scrambled siRNA, cells respond to FK228 with upregulation of RhoB and p21 protein while cells transfected with RhoB siRNA 4 demonstrate silenced RhoB and lack of p21 upregulation in response to FK228 ( Figure 6A ), and that knockdown of RhoB significantly inhibited FK228 induced growth arrest ( Figure 6B ). These results suggest that HDAC inhibitor-based therapies could be effective against ATC that are unresponsive to PPAR? agonists. To test this possibility, we evaluated the response to FK228 in THJ-16T cells, which is a cell line derived from a primary ATC tumor in our laboratory. THJ-16T cells express no PPAR? and do not show upregulation of RhoB or inhibition of cell proliferation in response to RS5444 ( Figures 6C ). However, THJ-16T cells do show upregulation of RhoB and p21 in response to FK228 and silencing of RhoB expression attenuates FK228-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation ( Figure 6C ).  HDAC inhibitor FK228 also upregulates RhoB Our results showed that increased expression of RhoB is an essential upstream step for PPAR?/p21-dependent inhibition of ATC proliferation, and in doing so, we identified RhoB as a novel point of therapeutic intervention in ATC.

However, THJ-16T cells do show upregulation of RhoB and p21 in response to FK228 and silencing of RhoB expression attenuates FK228-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation ( Figure 6C ).  Discussion Our novel discovery that PPAR? upregulates RhoB in ATC cells was prompted by RS5444-mediated alterations in cell morphology coupled with supporting literature demonstrating that enhanced RhoB activity was associated with growth inhibition and elevated p21 ( 17 , 28 , 29 ). RhoA and RhoC share ?86% amino acid homology with RhoB and also mediate actin stress fiber formation. Other RhoGTPases, which include Rac1 and Cdc42, have been found to promote oncogenesis, invasion and metastasis ( 30 , 31 ). However, RhoB is antiproliferative and proapoptotic in cancer cells ( 32 ), and overexpression of RhoB can inhibit cell migration, invasion, and metastasis ( 33 ). In head and neck, lung and brain cancers, RhoB levels are decreased with tumor progression suggesting that silencing this pathway is critical to tumor survival and progression ( 34 - 36 ). Our data demonstrate that RhoB mRNA and protein levels are low in ATC cell lines with upregulation upon exposure to RS5444 or FK228. We found that RS5444 regulates RhoB at the transcriptional level with rapid upregulation of RhoB mRNA by 2 hrs of treatment and protein levels by 4 hrs. We identified two putative PPAR? response elements (?1302 to ?1282; ?1422 to ?1402) in the RhoB promoter with 70?80% homology to a consensus PPAR? response element (PPRE). However, transient transfection of the RhoB promoter linked to a luciferase reporter (1876 bp promoter fragment) in DRO, KTC2 and KTC3 did not lead to induction of luciferase activity after 24 hr treatment with 10 nM RS5444 even though treatment with 1 ng/ml FK228 induced luciferase activity 3?9 fold ( Figure S2 ). Thus, the transcriptional regulation of RhoB by PPAR? may be regulated by another region of the RhoB gene or by a more complicated mechanism involving structured chromatin complexes not assayable using transfected RhoB promoter linked to luciferase. RhoB transcript levels have been observed to be transcriptionally suppressed by HDAC1 and found to be positively regulated when treated with an HDAC inhibitor (trapoxin A) via an inverted CCAAT element in the RhoB promoter 451 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site ( 27 ). RhoB is an early response gene responding to environmental induction due to environment stresses, such as UV irradiation, which under this circumstance, is mediated by the RNA-binding protein HuR stabilizing RhoB mRNA ( 37 ). Oppositely, oncogenic signals mediated by the Ras/PI3K/Akt pathway suppress RhoB expression ( 38 ). Thus, while multiple mechanisms appear to regulate RhoB expression in cancer, the important consequence of our work is that RhoB can be re-expressed in ATC through the use of drugs, resulting in biologically active protein that opposes tumor growth. We describe a novel mechanistic signaling pathway leading to tumor growth inhibition by two classes of drugs via a RhoB dependent mechanism that is upstream of p21. We show that PPAR?-mediated upregulation of p21 mRNA occurs through RhoB by using dominant negative RhoB and siRNA to silence RhoB. Two reports have identified a potential link between upregulation of p21 and RhoB ( 28 , 29 ). In one report, RhoB-GG induced p21 in a p53-dependent manner, though this was dispensable because RhoB-GG still inhibited growth of p53-null cells that lacked p21 ( 28 ). The authors concluded that RhoB-GG suppressed human tumor cell proliferation by more than one mechanism and that it promoted apoptosis as well as inhibited cell cycle transit. In the other report, ectopic expression of RhoB was demonstrated to upregulate p21 ( 17 , 28 , 29 ). Our present study is the first to show that endogenous RhoB is directly responsible for regulation of p21 mRNA and protein levels by RS5444 and FK228 in p53-wild type (DRO and KTC2) as well as p53-mutant (ARO and KTC3) cells ( 39 ). In a recent report, ciglitazone and rosiglitazone increased apoptosis in several ATC cell lines ( 40 ). The lack of induction of apoptosis by RS5444 ( 9 ) is striking since expression of RhoB induces apoptosis in cancer cells in cell culture [reviewed in ( 32 )] and ectopic tumors grown in mice ( 41 , 42 ). Even more surprising, DAPI staining revealed that treatment with FK228 also does not induce apoptosis in THJ-11T and THJ-16T with only slight apoptosis (?12%) in DRO ( Figure S3A ). Using a LDH assay to examine overall cell death, FK228 treatment again only slightly induces cell death (?13%) in DRO with no effect on KTC2 and KTC3 cells ( Figure S3B ). One study demonstrated that cyclin B1 is the target for suppression by RhoB causing apoptosis ( 43 ). It is possible that both RS5444 and FK228 could stimulate an antiapoptotic pathway antagonizing the proapoptotic properties of RhoB that is independent of the regulatory role of RhoB in cell proliferation. Alternatively, it may be that induction of apoptosis by rosiglitazone may be PPAR?/RhoB-independent. One additional consideration is that cellular localization and post-translational modification (prenylation and sumoylation) of RhoB are critical regulators of its effects ( 32 ). Site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated the requirement for palmitoylated cysteine 192 and prenylated cysteine 193 for the tumor suppressive and proapoptotic activities of RhoB ( 27 , 28 ). Understanding these mechanisms could be important in the selection of the most potent PPAR? agonist or RhoB modulator for combinatorial therapy such as a Tzd and taxane against ATC ( 9 ). Importantly, we found that chronic daily treatment of mice harboring ATC tumors with 0.025% RS5444 in the diet retains the ability to sustain elevated RhoB over 4 weeks of treatment ( Figure 2D ). This also suggests that RhoB and p21 may be ideal molecular markers of response to therapy and easily measured in biopsy tissue following treatment. In summary, we have identified a novel growth inhibitory pathway regulated by PPAR? and identified a HDAC inhibitor that upregulates RhoB mRNA and protein in human ATC cells ( Figure 6D ). Elevated RhoB protein is necessary for these two drugs to then upregulate p21 mRNA and protein as well as inhibit cell proliferation ( Figure 6D ). Thus, RhoB is implicated as a critical signaling node that could be therapeutically targeted in ATC. Importantly, it is a target that can be upregulated by multiple classes of drugs. HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) ( 44 ), prenylation inhibitors (FTI, GGTI) ( 32 ), HDAC inhibitors (FK228) and now PPAR? agonists upregulate RhoB in various cancers. Although the connection to RhoB has not been made in ATC, the aforementioned classes of drugs inhibit growth in ATC cells ( 45 - 47 ) most likely acting in part through upregulation of functional RhoB. We are currently investigating the role of these drugs that mediate RhoB upregulation and growth inhibition in ATC. Post-translational modification and cellular localization of RhoB as a result of treatment with each of these drugs will also most likely dictate optimal antitumor activity ( 32 ) and allow for rational selection of combinatorial therapy with maximum benefit to the patient.  Discussion Our novel discovery that PPAR? upregulates RhoB in ATC cells was prompted by RS5444-mediated alterations in cell morphology coupled with supporting literature demonstrating that enhanced RhoB activity was associated with growth inhibition and elevated p21 ( 17 , 28 , 29 ).

Even more surprising, DAPI staining revealed that treatment with FK228 also does not induce apoptosis in THJ-11T and THJ-16T with only slight apoptosis (?12%) in DRO ( Figure S3A ). Using a LDH assay to examine overall cell death, FK228 treatment again only slightly induces cell death (?13%) in DRO with no effect on KTC2 and KTC3 cells ( Figure S3B ). One study demonstrated that cyclin B1 is the target for suppression by RhoB causing apoptosis ( 43 ). It is possible that both RS5444 and FK228 could stimulate an antiapoptotic pathway antagonizing the proapoptotic properties of RhoB that is independent of the regulatory role of RhoB in cell proliferation. Alternatively, it may be that induction of apoptosis by rosiglitazone may be PPAR?/RhoB-independent. One additional consideration is that cellular localization and post-translational modification (prenylation and sumoylation) of RhoB are critical regulators of its effects ( 32 ). Site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated the requirement for palmitoylated cysteine 192 and prenylated cysteine 193 for the tumor suppressive and proapoptotic activities of RhoB ( 27 , 28 ). Understanding these mechanisms could be important in the selection of the most potent PPAR? agonist or RhoB modulator for combinatorial therapy such as a Tzd and taxane against ATC ( 9 ). Importantly, we found that chronic daily treatment of mice harboring ATC tumors with 0.025% RS5444 in the diet retains the ability to sustain elevated RhoB over 4 weeks of treatment ( Figure 2D ). This also suggests that RhoB and p21 may be ideal molecular markers of response to therapy and easily measured in biopsy tissue following treatment. In summary, we have identified a novel growth inhibitory pathway regulated by PPAR? and identified a HDAC inhibitor that upregulates RhoB mRNA and protein in human ATC cells ( Figure 6D ). Elevated RhoB protein is necessary for these two drugs to then upregulate p21 mRNA and protein as well as inhibit cell proliferation ( Figure 6D ). Thus, RhoB is implicated as a critical signaling node that could be therapeutically targeted in ATC. Importantly, it is a target that can be upregulated by multiple classes of drugs. HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) ( 44 ), prenylation inhibitors (FTI, GGTI) ( 32 ), HDAC inhibitors (FK228) and now PPAR? agonists upregulate RhoB in various cancers. Although the connection to RhoB has not been made in ATC, the aforementioned classes of drugs inhibit growth in ATC cells ( 45 - 47 ) most likely acting in part through upregulation of functional RhoB. We are currently investigating the role of these drugs that mediate RhoB upregulation and growth inhibition in ATC. Post-translational modification and cellular localization of RhoB as a result of treatment with each of these drugs will also most likely dictate optimal antitumor activity ( 32 ) and allow for rational selection of combinatorial therapy with maximum benefit to the patient.
