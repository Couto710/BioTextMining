Transmission disequilibrium testing of the chromosome 15q11-q13 region in autism Evidence implicates the serotonin transporter gene ( SLC6A4 ) and the 15q11-q13 genes as candidates for autism as well as restricted repetitive behavior (RRB). We conducted dense transmission disequilibrium mapping of the 15q11-q13 region with 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 86 strictly defined autism trios and tested association between SNPs and autism using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT). As exploratory analyses, parent-of-origin effects were examined using likelihood-ratio tests (LRT) and genotype-phenotype associations for specific RRB using the Family-Based Association Test (FBAT). Additionally, gene-gene interactions between nominally associated 15q11-q13 variants and 5-HTTLPR, the common length polymorphism of SLC6A4 , were examined using conditional logistic regression (CLR). TDT revealed nominally significant transmission disequilibrium between autism and five SNPs, three of which are located within close proximity of the GABAA receptor subunit gene clusters. Three SNPs in the SNRPN/UBE3A region had marginal imprinting effects. FBAT for genotype-phenotype relations revealed nominally significant association between two SNPs and one ADI-R sub-domain item. However, both TDT and FBAT were not statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. Gene-gene interaction analyses by CLR revealed additive genetic effect models, without interaction terms, fit the data best. Lack of robust association between the 15q11-q13 SNPs and RRB phenotypes may be due to a small sample size and absence of more specific RRB measurement. Further investigation of the 15q11-q13 region with denser genotyping in a larger sample set may be necessary to determine whether this region confers risk to autism, indicated by association, or to specific autism phenotypes.  Introduction Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by qualitative impairments in reciprocal social interaction, deficits in communication, and the presence of restricted repetitive behavior (RRB) with onset before 3 years of age ( APA 1994 ). Autism is a severe form of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), which also include pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger disorder. ASDs are relatively common and highly heritable. The current estimate of the prevalence is 0.2% for autism and 0.6% for all ASDs ( Chakrabarti and Fombonne 2005 ). Twin studies show increased concordance rates in monozygotic twins (60-91%) compared with those in dizygotic twins (0-10%) ( Bailey et al. 1995 ; Steffenburg et al. 1989 ). Sibling recurrence rate has been estimated to be 4.5% ( Jorde et al. 1991 ). Genetic studies suggest that autism is a complex genetic disorder with oligogenic inheritance, epistatic interactions among common susceptibility alleles, gene-environment interactions, and an undetermined proportion of rare variants, including inherited and de novo copy number variants (the first identified being chromosomal disorders). Estimates of the number of genes involved in autism range from 3-10 ( Folstein and Rosen-Sheidley 2001 ; Pickles et al. 1995 ) to more than 15 ( Risch et al. 1999 ), with each gene variant likely making a different contribution to the clinical symptomatology ( Veenstra-Vanderweele et al. 2004 ). Identification of autism susceptibility genes has been hampered by phenotypic heterogeneity ( Spence et al. 2006 ), which is reduced by the application of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) ( Hus et al. 2007 ; Veenstra-Vanderweele et al. 2004 ). The ADI-R is a semi-structured interview that is conducted with the primary caregiver designed to assess children's current and past behavior in three key domains of autism: social interaction, communication and restricted repetitive behavior (RRB) ( Lord et al. 1994 ). The ADOS is a standardized semi-structured observational measure of the child, in which the examiner elicits socio-communicative behaviors that are delayed, abnormal, or absent in autism ( Lord et al. 2000 ). Neither the ADI-R nor the ADOS is designed as a rating scale, however, the individual items and sub-domain items on the ADI-R and ADOS provide critical information regarding behavioral severity within autism ( Brune et al. 2006 ). Several studies have used the phenotypic data derived from the ADI-R and/or ADOS in order to further reduce heterogeneity and help identify potential autism susceptibility genes. For example, two studies have demonstrated increased linkage to chromosome 2q in families with probands who had delayed phrase speech at 36 months ( Buxbaum et al. 2001 ; Shao et al. 2002a ). Another study used savant skills factor (SSF) derived from the ADI-R and found an increased linkage at D15S511, a marker linked to GABRB3 , in families with individuals with high SSF ( Nurmi et al. 2003b ). Various forms of RRB, such as flapping arms, lining up objects, peculiar fascination with odd objects or part of objects, a very narrow restricted interests, intolerance to changes of routines and insistence on sameness are common among individuals with ASDs ( Lewis and Bodfish 1998 ; Lord et al. 1994 ; Rutter 1985 ; Szatmari et al. 2006 ; Turner 1999 ). Recently, Cuccaro and colleagues derived two RRB factors from the ADI-R, Repetitive Sensory Motor Action (RSMA) and Insistence on Sameness (IS) ( Cuccaro et al. 2003 ). Using these factors, Shao and colleagues found a higher linkage signal to the 15q11-q13 region among families sharing high IS factor scores ( Shao et al. 2003 ). Interestingly, a recent factor analysis of the ADI-R in 209 children with ASDs found two of three factors derived form the ADI-R sub-domains directly related to RRB: Repetitive Sensory and Motor Behavior and Inflexible Language and Behavior ( Georgiades et al. 2007 ). In accord with this finding, a recent revision of the ADOS, which formerly did not include RRB scores as part of the diagnostic classification of ASDs, found that including RRB improved the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the disorder ( Gotham et al. 2007 ). Furthermore, among three domains of autism, only RRB at age 2 significantly predicts diagnosis at age 9 after controlling for IQ ( Lord et al. 2006 ). These findings support the significance of RRB in ASD research and its applicability to genetic association studies. Several lines of evidence provide support for the role of the serotonin transporter gene ( SLC6A4 ) in the pathogeneses of autism as well as RRB. SLC6A4 is a strong candidate gene for autism, based on reports of hyperserotonemia in autism ( Cook et al. 1993 ; Coutinho et al. 2007 ; Hranilovic et al. 2006 ) and efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) targeting the serotonin transporter for reducing RRB and related aggression in autism ( Kolevzon et al. 2006 ). 5-HTTLPR, the promoter-linked 44-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism of SLC6A4 , has been widely studied in autism with conflicting results. To date, 8 of 15 family-based association studies reported over-transmission of either the short or long allele of 5-HTTLPR from the parents to their child with autism ( Cho et al. 2007 ; Devlin et al. 2005 ; Guerini et al. 2006 ; Ramoz et al. 2006 ). In addition, our laboratory recently reported significant relations between 5-HTTLPR and specific behavioral phenotypes including a specific form of RRB, stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms as measured on the ADI-R ( Brune et al. 2006 ). Chromosome 15q11-q13 region has been also implicated in autism and RRB, based on the following observations: 1) maternal duplication of this region is the most common chromosomal abnormality associated with autism ( Bolton et al. 2001 ; Bolton et al. 2004 ; Browne et al. 1997 ; Cook et al. 1997 ; Gillberg 1998 ; Schroer et al. 1998 ; Sebat et al. 2007 ; Szatmari et al. 2007 ; Wolpert et al. 2000a ; Wolpert et al. 2000b) ; 2) genetic markers near GABRB3 within the 15q11-q13 region have been implicated in autism through both linkage and association studies ( Buxbaum et al. 2002 ; Cook et al. 1998 ; Curran et al. 2005 ; Kim et al. 2007 ; Liu et al. 2001 ; Martin et al. 2000 ; McCauley et al. 2004 ; Philippe et al. 1999 ; Shao et al. 2003 ; Shao et al. 2002b ), and 3) clinical and genetic overlaps between Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and ASDs. PWS is a rare genetic disorder caused by structural or functional absence of paternally inherited genes in the 15q11-q13 region. The majority of PWS individuals suffer from high levels of RRB, which is a diagnostic feature of ASDs ( Bittel and Butler 2005 ; Dykens and Shah 2003 ; Dykens et al. 1999 ; State and Dykens 2000 ). Furthermore, an increased rate of ASD symptoms has been reported among individuals with PWS ( Veltman et al. 2005 ). Based on these observations, we examined the 15q11-q13 region using 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 86 autism trios and investigated transmission disequilibrium between these SNPs and autism. We also explored possible parent-of-origin effects using likelihood-ratio tests (LRT). In addition, we carried out exploratory analyses for genotype-phenotype associations between the 15q11-q13 SNPs and RRB phenotypes as measured by the ADI-R and ADOS. Based on a previous report ( Nurmi et al. 2003b ), we evaluated correlations between these SNPs and savant skills as measured on the ADI-R. As epistatic interactions among common susceptibility alleles may further increase susceptibility to autism, we examined interaction terms between the 15q11-q13 SNPs and 5-HTTLPR, that has previously shown positive correlations with specific ASD phenotypes ( Brune et al. 2006 ), using conditional logistic regression (CLR).  Methods Subjects Recruitment, assessment, and inclusion/exclusion criteria of subjects were described in Kim et al (2002) . Only one sibling was randomly selected from each affected sibling pair. In addition, subjects for the present study also met following criteria: 1) at least 3 years old, 2) had sufficient blood or DNA available for fine mapping studies, and 3) met the ADI-R and ADOS classification for autistic disorder. All subjects had a best estimate diagnosis of autistic disorder by a clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist. 86 children with autistic disorder and their biological parents (72 trios from the University of Chicago, and 14 trios from the University of California at San Diego) were included in the present study. As expected, the male to female ratio was approximately 4:1 (79.1%, n=68 vs. 20.9%, n=18). Detailed phenotypic data measured on both the ADI-R and ADOS were available only for the 72 subjects from the University of Chicago Developmental Disorders Clinic; they are referred to as “Core Sample” in the present study. Clinical Characteristics of Core Sample are summarized in Table 1 . Phenotypic Assessment: ADI-R and ADOS The ADI-R is a semi-structured interview that is conducted with the primary caregiver ( Lord et al. 1994 ). Parents were interviewed using the research version of the ADI-R ( Lord et al. 1994 ). The ADOS is a direct observational measure of the child, which is conducted in an interview or play-like setting ( Lord et al. 2000 ). An appropriate module for ADOS (1-4) was determined by the age and language level of subjects. Eight subjects received the Pre-Linguistic Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (PL-ADOS) ( DiLavore et al. 1995 ), which was treated as Module 1 for analyses. After complete description of the study to the parents, written informed consent was obtained. Assent was obtained from the children and adolescents. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Chicago and University of California at San Diego. The 15q11-q13 SNP Genotyping A total of 116 SNPs were selected from the 15q11-q13 region of an approximately 5.5 million base-pair-interval based on availability of TaqMan® SNP genotyping assays in 2001 ( www.appliedbiosystems.com ), position ( denser SNPs were placed between UBE3A and GABRG3 , the interval previously associated with autism), and minor allele frequency (MAF?0.2) ( Table 2 ). Figure 1 shows the position of the 116 SNPs across the 15q11-q13 region drawn by Haploview program version 3.32 ( http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/ ). The SNPs are focused largely around known genes or transcripts, leading to the appearance of higher linkage disequilibrium (LD) across the region unless the typical physical map overlay is considered where SNPs are clustered along the region. SNPs were genotyped by TaqMan® SNP genotyping assays. The standard TaqMan® SNP genotyping assay protocol was observed for polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), which contained 10 ng of dry DNA, 2.5 ?L of 2x TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.25 ?L of 20x SNP Genotyping Assay Mix, and 2.25 ?L of water, for a total volume of 5 ?L. All PCRs were performed using a PerkinElmer 9700 Thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: 1 enzyme activation step at 95.0°C for 10 minutes, and 40 to 50 alternating cycles of denaturation at 92.0°C for 15 seconds and reannealing and extension at 60.0°C for 60 to 90 seconds. The fluorescence intensity of the final reaction product was measured using an LJL Analyst AD fluorescence microplate reader and LJL Criterion Host Software (LJL Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). 5-HTTLPR Genotype data 5-HTTLPR was previously genotyped in the same sample set and reported in Kim et al (2002) . As we previously found an evidence of allelic association between 5-HTTLPR genotype and specific autism phenotypes measured on the ADI-R and ADOS ( Brune et al. 2006 ), we focused on 5-HTTLPR, the 44-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene ( SLC6A4 ) for gene-gene interaction analyses. Statistical Analysis Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT): Among 116 SNPs, 23 SNPs were dropped: 19 markers had more than one Mendelian error, 2 markers were not in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and 2 markers had more than one Mendelian error and were not in HWE ( Table 2 ). In order to examine association between the remaining 93 SNPs and autism in 86 autism trios, we carried out TDT using Haploview version 3.32. ( http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/ ). Power was calculated using Genetic Power Calculator ( Purcell et al. 2003 ). Parent-of-origin analyses: As a part of exploratory analyses, we examined possible parent-of-origin effects using the likelihood-ratio test (LRT) for the 93 SNPs ( Weinberg 1999 ). We first tested for imprinting in the absence of effect of maternal genotype given the evidence for imprinting in this region and lack of evidence for maternal genotype effects ( Hogart et al. 2007 ). For SNPs with missing parental genotypes, the log-linear model was used to test imprinting effects ( Weinberg 1999 ). Whereas for SNPs with no missing parental genotypes, the logistic model was used to test imprinting effects ( Weinberg 1999 ). These tests provide a chi-square statistic with 1 degree of freedom of the imprinting effect. To check whether maternal genotype influenced these results, follow-up tests which conditioned on maternal genotype were conducted. Inclusion of the maternal genotype effects in the model reduces the power of the parent-of-origin test. Genotype-Phenotype analyses: For the exploratory genotype-phenotype analyses, family-based association analyses were conducted to eliminate effects of population admixture. We used the Family-Based Association Test (FBAT) program ( www.biostat.harvard.edu/?fbat/default.html ) developed by Laird and colleagues ( Laird et al. 2000 ; Rabinowitz and Laird 2000 ) to test whether transmission at each of the five SNPs of the15q11-q13 that showed nominally significant transmission disequilibrium was related to phenotype. In order to control for effects of age and non-verbal IQ, each phenotype measure was modeled as the dependent variable of these covariates and the residuals were used as the adjusted phenotype in the FBAT analyses. Additive, dominant and recessive models were tested. The following ADI-R scores were separately tested: RRB domain total, RRB sub-domains (i.e., Preoccupations and circumscribed interests, Routines and rituals, Stereotyped and repetitive mannerisms, and Preoccupations with parts or materials), verbal sub-domain that include stereotyped behavior (i.e., Failure to initiate or sustain conversation, and Stereotyped, repetitive, or idiosyncratic speech), and the sum of the sub-domains from the Inflexible language and behavior and Repetitive sensory motor behavior factors derived in Georgiades et al. (2007) . We also tested the RRB domain score of the ADOS with module (1-4) as an additional covariate. Because the majority of our subjects were missing at least one item from the RSMA and IS factors derived in Cuccaro et al. (2003) , we did not use these measures. Of note, these items are not part of the ADI-R classification algorithm. For our exploratory analyses of savant skills, we calculated the weighted factor score Savant Skills used in Nurmi et al. ( Nurmi et al. 2003b ), based on the principal components analysis of Tadevosyan-Leyfer et al. (2003) , which includes current and ever scores of visual-spatial, computational, mnemonic, and musical skills. A total of 11 phenotypes were tested. Power to detect a locus that contributes to RRB was calculated using QUANTO version 1.1 ( Gauderman and Morrison 2006 ). In this study, the FBAT empirical variance (“-e”) option was not used in the genotype-phenotype analysis to test association in the presence of linkage because the probands were not related (only one sibling was randomly selected from each affected sibling pair). Gene × Gene interaction analyses: We examined gene × gene interaction between five SNPs of the15q11-q13 that showed nominally significant transmission disequilibrium and 5-HTTLPR. Conditional logistic regression modeling was chosen for studying epistatic effects at the two unlinked loci, because it provides a natural and flexible framework for incorporating additional effects, such as parent-of-origin effects ( Cordell et al. 2004 ). For CLR, trios with incomplete data were dropped and the remaining complete case-parents were analyzed along with pseudo-siblings (see Table 4 ). We defined the ‘risk alleles’ as those alleles preferentially transmitted to the children with autism (e.g., the Short allele for 5-HTTLPR). Odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values for transmission of each risk allele and co-transmission of both risk alleles were calculated. Additive effects were considered to be consistent with the TDT. All models were programmed using the PROC LOGISTIC procedure in SAS/STAT® software version 9.1.  Subjects Recruitment, assessment, and inclusion/exclusion criteria of subjects were described in Kim et al (2002) . Only one sibling was randomly selected from each affected sibling pair. In addition, subjects for the present study also met following criteria: 1) at least 3 years old, 2) had sufficient blood or DNA available for fine mapping studies, and 3) met the ADI-R and ADOS classification for autistic disorder. All subjects had a best estimate diagnosis of autistic disorder by a clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist. 86 children with autistic disorder and their biological parents (72 trios from the University of Chicago, and 14 trios from the University of California at San Diego) were included in the present study. As expected, the male to female ratio was approximately 4:1 (79.1%, n=68 vs. 20.9%, n=18). Detailed phenotypic data measured on both the ADI-R and ADOS were available only for the 72 subjects from the University of Chicago Developmental Disorders Clinic; they are referred to as “Core Sample” in the present study. Clinical Characteristics of Core Sample are summarized in Table 1 .  Phenotypic Assessment: ADI-R and ADOS The ADI-R is a semi-structured interview that is conducted with the primary caregiver ( Lord et al. 1994 ). Parents were interviewed using the research version of the ADI-R ( Lord et al. 1994 ). The ADOS is a direct observational measure of the child, which is conducted in an interview or play-like setting ( Lord et al. 2000 ). An appropriate module for ADOS (1-4) was determined by the age and language level of subjects. Eight subjects received the Pre-Linguistic Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (PL-ADOS) ( DiLavore et al. 1995 ), which was treated as Module 1 for analyses. After complete description of the study to the parents, written informed consent was obtained. Assent was obtained from the children and adolescents. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Chicago and University of California at San Diego.  The 15q11-q13 SNP Genotyping A total of 116 SNPs were selected from the 15q11-q13 region of an approximately 5.5 million base-pair-interval based on availability of TaqMan® SNP genotyping assays in 2001 ( www.appliedbiosystems.com ), position ( denser SNPs were placed between UBE3A and GABRG3 , the interval previously associated with autism), and minor allele frequency (MAF?0.2) ( Table 2 ). Figure 1 shows the position of the 116 SNPs across the 15q11-q13 region drawn by Haploview program version 3.32 ( http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/ ). The SNPs are focused largely around known genes or transcripts, leading to the appearance of higher linkage disequilibrium (LD) across the region unless the typical physical map overlay is considered where SNPs are clustered along the region.

The standard TaqMan® SNP genotyping assay protocol was observed for polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), which contained 10 ng of dry DNA, 2.5 ?L of 2x TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.25 ?L of 20x SNP Genotyping Assay Mix, and 2.25 ?L of water, for a total volume of 5 ?L. All PCRs were performed using a PerkinElmer 9700 Thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: 1 enzyme activation step at 95.0°C for 10 minutes, and 40 to 50 alternating cycles of denaturation at 92.0°C for 15 seconds and reannealing and extension at 60.0°C for 60 to 90 seconds. The fluorescence intensity of the final reaction product was measured using an LJL Analyst AD fluorescence microplate reader and LJL Criterion Host Software (LJL Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA).  5-HTTLPR Genotype data 5-HTTLPR was previously genotyped in the same sample set and reported in Kim et al (2002) . As we previously found an evidence of allelic association between 5-HTTLPR genotype and specific autism phenotypes measured on the ADI-R and ADOS ( Brune et al. 2006 ), we focused on 5-HTTLPR, the 44-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene ( SLC6A4 ) for gene-gene interaction analyses.  Statistical Analysis Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT): Among 116 SNPs, 23 SNPs were dropped: 19 markers had more than one Mendelian error, 2 markers were not in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and 2 markers had more than one Mendelian error and were not in HWE ( Table 2 ). In order to examine association between the remaining 93 SNPs and autism in 86 autism trios, we carried out TDT using Haploview version 3.32. ( http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/ ). Power was calculated using Genetic Power Calculator ( Purcell et al. 2003 ). Parent-of-origin analyses: As a part of exploratory analyses, we examined possible parent-of-origin effects using the likelihood-ratio test (LRT) for the 93 SNPs ( Weinberg 1999 ). We first tested for imprinting in the absence of effect of maternal genotype given the evidence for imprinting in this region and lack of evidence for maternal genotype effects ( Hogart et al. 2007 ).

In order to control for effects of age and non-verbal IQ, each phenotype measure was modeled as the dependent variable of these covariates and the residuals were used as the adjusted phenotype in the FBAT analyses. Additive, dominant and recessive models were tested. The following ADI-R scores were separately tested: RRB domain total, RRB sub-domains (i.e., Preoccupations and circumscribed interests, Routines and rituals, Stereotyped and repetitive mannerisms, and Preoccupations with parts or materials), verbal sub-domain that include stereotyped behavior (i.e., Failure to initiate or sustain conversation, and Stereotyped, repetitive, or idiosyncratic speech), and the sum of the sub-domains from the Inflexible language and behavior and Repetitive sensory motor behavior factors derived in Georgiades et al. (2007) . We also tested the RRB domain score of the ADOS with module (1-4) as an additional covariate. Because the majority of our subjects were missing at least one item from the RSMA and IS factors derived in Cuccaro et al. (2003) , we did not use these measures. Of note, these items are not part of the ADI-R classification algorithm. For our exploratory analyses of savant skills, we calculated the weighted factor score Savant Skills used in Nurmi et al. ( Nurmi et al. 2003b ), based on the principal components analysis of Tadevosyan-Leyfer et al. (2003) , which includes current and ever scores of visual-spatial, computational, mnemonic, and musical skills. A total of 11 phenotypes were tested. Power to detect a locus that contributes to RRB was calculated using QUANTO version 1.1 ( Gauderman and Morrison 2006 ). In this study, the FBAT empirical variance (“-e”) option was not used in the genotype-phenotype analysis to test association in the presence of linkage because the probands were not related (only one sibling was randomly selected from each affected sibling pair). Gene × Gene interaction analyses: We examined gene × gene interaction between five SNPs of the15q11-q13 that showed nominally significant transmission disequilibrium and 5-HTTLPR. Conditional logistic regression modeling was chosen for studying epistatic effects at the two unlinked loci, because it provides a natural and flexible framework for incorporating additional effects, such as parent-of-origin effects ( Cordell et al. 2004 ). For CLR, trios with incomplete data were dropped and the remaining complete case-parents were analyzed along with pseudo-siblings (see Table 4 ). We defined the ‘risk alleles’ as those alleles preferentially transmitted to the children with autism (e.g., the Short allele for 5-HTTLPR). Odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values for transmission of each risk allele and co-transmission of both risk alleles were calculated. Additive effects were considered to be consistent with the TDT. All models were programmed using the PROC LOGISTIC procedure in SAS/STAT® software version 9.1.  Results Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT): Five of 93 SNPs showed nominally significant association with autism ( Table 3 ). None of these SNPs was statistically significant when using a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (? = 0.05/93), which yields a significance level of 0.0005. Three of the five SNPs were located within or in close proximity of three GABAA receptor subunit gene clusters ( GABRB3, GABRA5, and GABRG3 ). There was no significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) between these five SNPs ( Figure 2 ). Power calculation revealed our sample size had approximately 33% power to detect association assuming a small to moderate effect size of each susceptibility allele (or odds ratio of 2) and minor allele frequency of 0.3. Three SNPs showed marginal imprinting effects [rs2340625, ?2 (df=1) =7.1034, p=.0078; rs4906951, ?2 (df=1) =5.3131, p=.0212; rs5001649, ?2 (df=1) =3.9471, p=.0469]. The later two SNPs were in LD with each other, r2 = 0.75. No LD was found with the 5 associated SNPs. These effects were no longer statistically significant when maternal genotype was included in the models. Genotype-Phenotype analyses: In the present study, we also explored if the five associated SNPs are related to specific RRB phenotypes and savant skills measured on the ADI-R and ADOS. The distribution of the genotype groups for the associated SNPs in the Core Sample was as follows: rs8037745 (A/A: 18, A/G: 42, G/G: 12), rs3212337 (C/C: 20, C/T: 39, T/T: 13), rs2075716 (C/C: 37, C/T: 28, T/T: 7), rs7180500 (A/A: 18, A/C: 37, C/C: 13), and rs1382056 (A/A: 20, A/G: 34, G/G: 18). Our exploratory analyses revealed two SNPs (rs2075716 and rs1382056) have nominally significant association with an ADI-R subdomain (B2V=Relative failure to initiate or sustain conversational interchange) ( Z = -2.88, p = 0.0039, and Z = -2.22, p = 0.0264, respectively) under a dominant model. The C allele of rs2075716 and the G allele of rs1382056 were each over-transmitted when subjects received less severe scores on the B2V subdomain adjusting for age and non-verbal IQ. In addition, the association between rs1382056 and the Savant skills factor is trending towards statistical significance ( Tadevoysan-Leyfer et al., 2003 ) ( Z = 1.83, p = 0.0680) under a dominant model. In this case, the G allele of rs1382056 was over-transmitted when subjects received more severe scores on the Savant skills factor adjusting for age and non-verbal IQ. However, none of these SNPs were statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (?=0.05/55=0.0009). Power calculations revealed that our sample (n = 72) can detect a locus that explains 36% of variance in RRB (R2=0.22) with 80% of power at a p-value 0.0009, when additive inheritance model and parent-offspring sample design were assumed. Gene × Gene interaction analyses: We present odds ratios, 95 % confidence intervals, and p-values from the additive models in Table 4 . There was no significant interaction term between each SNP and 5-HTTLPR genotypes in any of the models considered. That is, the best model contained only the two main effects of genotype for the SNP and 5-HTTLPR.  Results Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT): Five of 93 SNPs showed nominally significant association with autism ( Table 3 ). None of these SNPs was statistically significant when using a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (? = 0.05/93), which yields a significance level of 0.0005. Three of the five SNPs were located within or in close proximity of three GABAA receptor subunit gene clusters ( GABRB3, GABRA5, and GABRG3 ). There was no significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) between these five SNPs ( Figure 2 ). Power calculation revealed our sample size had approximately 33% power to detect association assuming a small to moderate effect size of each susceptibility allele (or odds ratio of 2) and minor allele frequency of 0.3. Three SNPs showed marginal imprinting effects [rs2340625, ?2 (df=1) =7.1034, p=.0078; rs4906951, ?2 (df=1) =5.3131, p=.0212; rs5001649, ?2 (df=1) =3.9471, p=.0469]. The later two SNPs were in LD with each other, r2 = 0.75. No LD was found with the 5 associated SNPs. These effects were no longer statistically significant when maternal genotype was included in the models. Genotype-Phenotype analyses: In the present study, we also explored if the five associated SNPs are related to specific RRB phenotypes and savant skills measured on the ADI-R and ADOS. The distribution of the genotype groups for the associated SNPs in the Core Sample was as follows: rs8037745 (A/A: 18, A/G: 42, G/G: 12), rs3212337 (C/C: 20, C/T: 39, T/T: 13), rs2075716 (C/C: 37, C/T: 28, T/T: 7), rs7180500 (A/A: 18, A/C: 37, C/C: 13), and rs1382056 (A/A: 20, A/G: 34, G/G: 18). Our exploratory analyses revealed two SNPs (rs2075716 and rs1382056) have nominally significant association with an ADI-R subdomain (B2V=Relative failure to initiate or sustain conversational interchange) ( Z = -2.88, p = 0.0039, and Z = -2.22, p = 0.0264, respectively) under a dominant model. The C allele of rs2075716 and the G allele of rs1382056 were each over-transmitted when subjects received less severe scores on the B2V subdomain adjusting for age and non-verbal IQ. In addition, the association between rs1382056 and the Savant skills factor is trending towards statistical significance ( Tadevoysan-Leyfer et al., 2003 ) ( Z = 1.83, p = 0.0680) under a dominant model. In this case, the G allele of rs1382056 was over-transmitted when subjects received more severe scores on the Savant skills factor adjusting for age and non-verbal IQ. However, none of these SNPs were statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (?=0.05/55=0.0009). Power calculations revealed that our sample (n = 72) can detect a locus that explains 36% of variance in RRB (R2=0.22) with 80% of power at a p-value 0.0009, when additive inheritance model and parent-offspring sample design were assumed. Gene × Gene interaction analyses: We present odds ratios, 95 % confidence intervals, and p-values from the additive models in Table 4 . There was no significant interaction term between each SNP and 5-HTTLPR genotypes in any of the models considered. That is, the best model contained only the two main effects of genotype for the SNP and 5-HTTLPR.  Discussion Chromosome 15q11-q13 is highly vulnerable to structural rearrangement. This region has been considered as an autism candidate region primarily because of multiple reports of maternal interstitial duplication associated with autism and positive linkage and association studies in chromosomally normal autism families ( Nurmi et al. 2003a ). The 15q11-q13 region also contains imprinted genes that are only expressed from either paternally or maternally inherited chromosome. Absence of maternally inherited genes causes Angelman syndrome (AS), whereas absence of paternally inherited genes is responsible for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Interestingly, increased rates of RRB as well as ASDs are reported among individuals with PWS, suggesting that the 15q11-q13 region may contain quantitative trait loci for RRB in addition to ASDs. In this study, we examined the 15q11-q13 region of approximately 5.5 million base-pair interval using 93 SNP markers in 86 autism trios. We also explored parent-of-origin effects in these 93 SNPs. Because of the potential implication of the 15q11-q13 region in RRB pathogenesis, we also investigated the SNPs for association with specific RRB phenotypes measured on the ADI-R and ADOS. Among 93 SNPs, five SNPs showed nominally significant association with autism in our 86 autism trios before correcting for multiple testing. These SNPs were not in significant LD with each other. Interestingly, three of five SNPs were located in close proximity of the GABAA receptor subunit gene clusters, located within 280Kb-interval. As genes of small to moderate effects may be responsible for autism phenotypes, genetic studies of autism often require a large number of samples in order to have adequate power. As an example, the current study had 33% power to detect genes of small to moderate effect, suggesting study in a larger sample would be necessary for a more conclusive study. Two SNPs located in the SNRPN region (rs5001649, rs4906951) and one in UBE3A (rs2340625) showed detectable imprinting effects. These SNPs were in a region which spanned 500k base pairs and included an associated SNP (rs8037745) in SNRPN . Interpretation of this data requires substantial caution, as these effects were not robust to inclusion of maternal genotype effects. Further, given the number of SNPs tested these results may be false positives. However, we believe the parent-of-origin effect is still worth-considering in our future studies and in a larger sample set. The FBAT for genotype-phenotype relations between specific RRB phenotypes and savant skills measured on the ADI-R and ADOS, and the five associated SNPs revealed nominally significant association between two SNPs (rs2075716 and rs1382056) and an ADI-R subdomain (B2V=Relative failure to initiate or sustain conversational interchange), which is a component of inflexible language behavior ( Georgiades et al. 2007 ). The lack of relationships between genotype and phenotype may be due to Type II error, lack of more thorough measurement of RRB, and other confounding effects (i.e., concurrent psychotropic medication use). In addition, our phenotypic measures were derived from the ADI-R and ADOS, which were not designed as rating scales. An instrument designed to assess RRB, such as the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised ( Bodfish et al. 1999 ; Bodfish et al. 2000 ) may increase the power to detect susceptibility alleles for RRB. Lastly, we also need to consider that the 15q11-q13 region may not contain quantitative trait loci for RRB or savant skills, but it may interact with genes in other chromosomal regions to increase ASD susceptibility. For example, one of the small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), HBII-52, in the 15q11-q13 has been shown to regulate the processing of the mRNA of the serotonin 2C receptor gene ( HTR2C ), which may be related with the pathogenesis of RRB ( Kishore and Stamm 2006 ). Previously, we have reported positive correlations between a specific RRB phenotype and 5-HTTLPR, a common length polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene ( SLC6A4 ), the main target site of SSRIs that are often used to treat RRB ( Brune et al. 2006 ). As 5-HTTLPR genotype data were available for the full set of 86 trios, we conducted exploratory analyses to examine gene × gene interaction between five SNPs and 5-HTTLPR using conditional logistic regression (CLR). CLR is one possible method to examine epistatic effects. Another method used to explore gene-gene interactions in autism is multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) (i.e. Ma et al. 2005 ). We chose CLR over MDR, because we were examining a total of 6 markers that showed significant main effects by TDT. When used in the presence of main effects or known important covariates, MDR does not disentangle the main effects in the final model. In addition, MDR does not assume genetic (locus) heterogeneity, which may severely impact the power of study ( Coffey et al. 2004 ). CLR analyses of additive genetic effects, however, did not identify significant gene × gene interaction terms between 5-HTTLPR and the five SNPs (rs8037745, rs3212337, rs2075716, rs7180500, and rs1382056) suggesting independent effects of the markers. Our study has several limitations. Small sample size and limited power to detect statistically significant transmission disequilibrium are the main limitations. In addition, we used phenotypic data derived from the ADI-R and ADOS, which may not provide sufficient phenotypic information for specific RRB phenotypes. Notably, these analyses were only exploratory given the main objective of this paper was extensive genotyping of the 15q11-q13 region in a strictly defined autism sample. In future studies, we may need to employ specific analysis methods, such as Restricted Partitioning Method (RPM), to evaluate epistatic effects for quantitative traits. Finally, the region was relatively poorly covered by SNPs in the current study and application of the current methods to a much denser set of SNPs, such as the density found in the current approximately 1 million genotype SNP chips will be necessary to provide full coverage. Of note, such chips may not cover all relevant regions in 15q11-q13 due to remaining gaps and common copy number variations (CNVs) across the region. Finally, the current approach emphasizes SNPs and doesn't fully cover the possibility of autism susceptibility CNVs that may not be in LD with SNPs.
