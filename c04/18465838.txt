A Nonparametric Likelihood Test for Detecting Discordance Between Two Measurements with Application to Censored Viral Load Determinations Patient management frequently involves quantitative evaluation of a patient’s attributes. For example in HIV studies, a high viral load can be a trigger to initiate or modify an antiretroviral therapy. At times, a new method of evaluation may substitute for an established one, provided that the new method does not result in different clinical decisions as compared to the old method. Traditional measures of agreement between the two methods are inadequate for deciding if a new method can replace the old. Especially when the data are censored by a detection limit, estimates of agreement can be biased unless the distribution for the censored data is correctly specified; this is usually not feasible in practice. We propose a nonparametric likelihood test which seamlessly handles censored data. We further show that the proposed test is a generalization of the test on nominal measurement concordance to continuous measurement. An exact permutation procedure is proposed for implementing the test. Our application is an HIV study to determine whether one method of processing plasma samples can safely substitute for the other. The plasma samples are used to determine viral load and a large portion of data are left censored due to a lower detection limit.  1 Introduction Some clinical studies involve two methods for measuring a continuous variable. The measured variable may be clinically important and affect treatment choice. It is thus important to assure that clinical decisions will not change when considering the substitution of an established method for a new one. In the management of HIV infected patients, the concentration of HIV in the blood, or viral load, is used to guide therapeutic decisions. A patient’s viral load strongly indicates HIV disease severity and predicts disease progression and infectiousness. For example, it is believed that HIV RNA suppression below 50 copies/mL should become the standard efficacy endpoint for HARRT therapies [ 1 ], thus patients not achieving < 50 copies/mL should be prescribed a change in therapy. It is also found that patients with viral loads < 1500 copies/mL are rarely infectious ([ 2 ] and [ 3 ]). An ongoing collaboration in South Africa, Project Phidisa, is establishing a clinical trial network to study HIV disease. Central to the endeavor is reliable viral load measurement. The standard method for collecting and transporting plasma samples is by EDTA tubes, where blood is drawn into a tube coated with anticoagulant EDTA. The EDTA tube is centrifuged and plasma is pipetted out. Plasma is then frozen and shipped to a central lab for viral load determination. However, this standard EDTA method is not easily implemented in South Africa, where it can be hard to transport frozen samples in the bushes. A more convenient method of plasma processing is by PPT tubes, which have a barrier that rides between blood cells and plasma after centrifugation. PPT tubes can then be shipped at ambient temperature. Prior to shipping, plasma can be either separated from the cells or left unseparated, we call them the PPT separated and the PPT unseparated method respectively. For a reference on these methods, see [ 4 ]. Of interest in Project Phidisa is whether the PPT methods can replace EDTA. Holodniy et al. studied these tubes and concluded that both PPT methods are equivalent to EDTA [ 5 ], whose study was based on HIV infected patients with viral loads above 5,000 RNA copies/mL. However, it is the performance of these methods over low viral loads (< 5000 copies/mL) that is of the greatest importance. For example, a viral load reading below (above) 50 copies/mL would indicate that the current therapy works (fails) to inhibit viral loads and the patient should stay (switch) therapy. If PPT is to substitute EDTA, we would at least require that a patient’s the viral load reading is equally likely to be below 50 copies/mL from PPT and EDTA. In Project Phidisa, patients with a wide range of viral loads were involved, from 750,000 RNA copies/mL down to below 50 RNA copies/mL, with a lower detection limit of 50 RNA copies/mL. Figure 1 presents the log 10 viral load readings of each patient from PPT versus EDTA, the left panel for the PPT separated and the right panel for the PPT unseparated. It seems that the readings from the PPT separated are close to those from the EDTA, while the readings from the PPT unseparated are likely higher than the respective readings from EDTA, at least for low viral loads. In particular, there are 92 subjects with PPT unseparated readings above 50 copies/mL and the respective EDTA readings below 50 copies/mL, but only 6 subjects with EDTA readings above 50 copies/mL and the respective PPT unseparated below 50 copies/mL. There are methods for evaluating the agreement between two methods over the same subjects, for example, the descriptive difference plot of Bland and Altman ([ 6 ], [ 7 ], [ 8 ]) and the agreement coefficients like the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC; [ 9 ], [ 10 ], [ 11 ]) and the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC; [ 12 ]). The difference plot is a scatter plot of the difference between the paired measurements against the average of the two. If the two methods agree, all points should be randomly scattered around the horizontal line through the origin. Though there are different types of ICC and CCC in literature, the basic concepts are simple. The ICC originates from ANOVA model of the observed readings, and basically calculates the percentage of variation not caused by the use of two different methods. The ICC ranges from 0 to 1. The CCC measures the closeness of the paired measurements to the concordance line (the 45° line through the origin) and ranges from -1 to 1. Larger values of both agreement coefficients indicate better agreement. A drawback with ICC and CCC is that they can indicate stronger agreement for more heterogeneous populations [ 13 ]. Another drawback is that ICC and CCC may indicate increasing agreement as the marginal distributions become more different even if the true agreement decreases or stays the same [ 14 ]. In applications like Project Phidisa, a graphical or a quantitative evaluation of the agreement between the two methods (one is EDTA, the other is PPT separated or PPT unseparated) is not enough. We need to construct a test for making a decision about whether one method can substitute for the other. It is hard to develop a test from agreement coefficients for this purpose. First, it is hard to decide a threshold in the null hypothesis, such that the agreement coefficient above the threshold corresponds to substitutability due to the above mentioned drawbacks. Second, if the data are censored, agreement coefficient estimates can be biased, unless correctly specified parametric distributions are assumed[ 15 ]. In practice, it is not possible to know if the assumed parametric distribution applies below the detection limit. The presence of a detection limit also hampers the use of Bland-Altman’s difference plot. In this paper, we propose a test based on nonparametric likelihood. In HIV studies, a clinical criterion for assessing disease severity is usually based on whether a patient’s viral loads are below a certain level s [ 1 - 3 ]. To determine if a new method can substitute for the other, we especially care whether a patient’s viral load measurements from the two methods are equally likely to be below s . This is equivalent to the concordance between the two measurements in terms of the binary event “viral load reading below/above s ”. Nonparametric likelihood can be applied to evaluate the concordance at s , as we will show in the next section. For continuous measurements within a region ?, we can let the value of s vary over ? and develop a global nonparametric likelihood (NPL) test statistic to test on the overall concordance between the two measurements. The NPL test can thus be viewed as a generalization of tests for nominal measurement concordance to continuous measurements. If the overall concordance is not rejected by the NPL test, we would conclude that the observed data does not contradict the equivalence between the two methods. As a nonparametric approach, the NPL test does not require any distributional assumptions on the two measurements even with censoring. It thus obviates the need for correct model specification and is attractive where little is know about the measurement distributions. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: § 2 develops the NPL test and describes an exact procedure for implementation, § 3 presents simulation results, § 4 applies the method to paired viral load measurements, while § 5 concludes with discussion.  2 Nonparametric Likelihood Test We have paired measurements ( X k, Y k ) from subject k , where X k is from one method, and Y k from the other, for k = 1, · · · , n . The bivariate variables ( X k, Y k ) are iid, and follow a joint distribution F XY with marginal distributions F X and F Y . At a given cutpoint s , dichotomization of X and Y leads to binary variables X s and Y s , with X s = 1 if X > s and 0 otherwise, similarly for Y s . Thus four categories C i j ( s ) , i, j = 0 and 1, are formed as shown by the 2 × 2 contingency table below, Y s = 0 Y s = 1 X s = 0 n 00 ( s ) n 01 ( s ) X s = 1 n 10 ( s ) n 11 ( s ) where n ij ( s ) denotes the number of subjects in category C i j ( s ) , e.g., n 01 ( s ) = ? k = 1 n I ( X k ? s , Y k > s ) is the number of subjects with first measurement below s and the second above s . Let p i j ( s ) = P { ( X , Y ) ? C i j ( s ) } , thus p 00( s ) + p 11( s ) is the probability of concordance between X s and Y s , or the concordance between X and Y around s , and p 01( s ) + p 10( s ) the probability of discordance around s . The nonparametric log likelihood function for { p ij ( s ), i, j = 0, 1} is (1) t ( s ) = ? i , j n i j ( s ) log { p i j ( s ) } . We are interested in whether the two measurements have the same probability of being below s , that is, H 0 s : F X ( s ) = F Y ( s ) Note that since F X ( s ) = p 00( s ) + p 01( s ) and F Y ( s ) = p 00( s ) + p 10( s ), H 0 s is equivalent to p 01( s ) = p 10( s ). The log likelihood ratio with respect to H 0 s is thus, (2) ? ( s ) = 2 { l ( s ; p ^ 00 , p ^ 01 , p ^ 10 , p ^ 11 ) ? l ( s ; p ^ 00 0 , p ^ 01 0 , p ^ 10 0 , p ^ 11 0 , ) } = 2 { n 01 ( s ) log ( 2 n 01 ( s ) n 01 ( s ) + n 10 ( s ) ) + n 10 ( s ) log ( 2 n 10 ( s ) n 01 ( s ) + n 10 ( s ) ) } where p ^ i j ( s ) is the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of p ij ( s ), and p ^ i j 0 ( s ) is the MLE under H 0 s . It is easy to show that p ^ i j ( s ) = n i j ( s ) ? n , and p ^ i i 0 ( s ) = p ^ i i ( s ) for i = 0, 1, p ^ 01 0 ( s ) = p ^ 10 0 ( s ) = { p ^ 01 ( s ) + p ^ 10 ( s ) } ? 2 . Equation (2) follows by plugging these MLE’s into the two respective log likelihood functions. Define p ^ ( s ) = n 01 ( s ) ? { n 01 ( s ) + n 10 ( s ) } . A 2nd order Taylor expansion of the log likelihood ratio around p ^ ( s ) = 0.5 is, (3) ? ( s ) = 2 { n 01 ( s ) + n 10 ( s ) } [ p ^ ( s ) log { 2 p ^ ( s ) } + { 1 ? p ^ ( s ) } log { 2 ? 2 p ^ ( s ) } ] ? { n 01 ( s ) + n 10 ( s ) } { 2 p ^ ( s ) ? 1 } 2 Under H 0 s and conditional on n 01( s ) + n 10( s ), n 01( s ) ? Binomial ( n 01( s ) + n 10( s ), 0.5). Thus p ^ ( s ) asymptotically follows a normal distribution with mean 0.5 and variance 0.52/{ n 01( s ) + n 10( s )}, and ?( s ) asymptotically follows a ? 1 2 distribution. The asymptotic form ( 3 ) of ?( s ) is in fact the McNemar statistic. Thus, at each fixed s , the nonparametric likelihood ratio is asymptotically equivalent to the McNemar statistic. For continuous measurements X and Y with common support ?, we have a sequence of such nonparametric likelihood ratios ?( s ) with s varying within ?. For the overall concordance between X and Y , we require that for any s ? ?, there is the same probability for the two measurements to be below s . Therefore, the null hypothesis is, H 0 : F X ( s ) = F Y ( s ) , for all s ? ? . In other words, the global null H 0 is that the two measurements follow the same marginal distribution. It is easy to see that, if H 0 is rejected, F XY ( x, y ) ? F XY ( y, x ), i.e., the two measurements are not exchangeable. In the following, we sometimes use “exchangeability” for whether two methods can substitute for each other. We define a global statistic ? for the test of H 0, which is the supremum of the likelihood ratios over ?. We call ? the NPL test statistic. (4) ? = sup s ? ? ? ( s ) . Each ?( s ) evaluates the discordance between X and Y around a specific cutpoint s , with larger values indicating bigger discordance between X s and Y s . ? uses the information at the location where X and Y disagree the most. This idea of taking the supremum of a sequence of statistics is like that of a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [ 16 ]. Since ?( s ) only changes when s changes from one observed value of X and Y to another, ? is simply ? = max s ? ( x 1 , ? , x n , y 1 , ? , y n ) ? ( s ) . If ?0 is the critical value satisfying P (? ? ?0) = 1 - ? at the nominal significance level ? , we reject H 0 when ? is greater than or equal to ?0. Rejection of H 0 means that the two measurements X and Y are not exchangeable and one method cannot substitute the other. ? is the maximum of a sequence of correlated statistics ( shown in the appendix ), whose distribution is not of any known family [ 17 ], though there are the simulation results [ 18 ]. We thus propose an exact permutation procedure for performing the test. As shown in the appendix , F XY ( x, y ) = F YX ( y, x ) implies H 0. Therefore, we can obtain the null distribution of the NPL test statistic ? by the following permutation procedure. Within each subject k , randomly decide whether or not to switch X k with Y k according to a Bernoulli(0.5), and thus obtain a permuted data point. For the r-th permuted data, compute the corresponding NPL test statistic which we denote as ?< r > following Table 1 . In the table, { s m, m = 1, · · · , M } is the sequence of cutpoints, with M as the number of distinct observed values of X and Y ; ?< r >( s m ) is the nonparametric likelihood ratio evaluated at s m from the r -th permuted data. The value of the NPL test statistic from the r -th permutation is ? < r > = max 1 ? m ? M ? < r > ( s m ) The p-value for H 0 is the proportion of permutations with ?< r > greater than or equal to ?obs, the value of the NPL test statistic from the observed data. That is, P ? value = ? r I ( ? < r > ) ? ? obs R where R is the number of permutations, with R = 2 n for exhaustive permutation and a sufficiently large number for Monte-Carlo permutation. The permutation procedure approaches the exact p-value as the number of permutations gets sufficiently large [ 19 ]. In the case of censoring by a detection limit, for example, by the lower detection limit in HIV viral load determination, the NPL test statistic evaluates the discordance between the two measurements over the observation range as well as at the detection limit. That is, ? C = sup( s ??: s ? C ) ?( s ) = max s ?( C , x 1,··· , x n, y 1,··· , y n ) ?( s ), where C is the lower detection limit and ?( C ) reflects the discordance around the detection limit. ? C would be the same as the ? from the completely observed data without censoring if the maximum of the nonparametric likelihood ratio occurs at some s ? C , i.e., sup( s ??) ?( s ) = sup( s ??, s ? C ) ?( s ).  3 Simulation Results As shown in § 2, to determine the concordance between two variables X and Y around a point s , instead of the nonparametric likelihood ratio ( 2 ), we can also use McNemar statistic ( 3 ). The consequent global test statistic is of the same form as ( 4 ) except that the supremum of the McNemar statistics over s ? ? is used. We call it the generalized McNemar test statistic, which is the generalization of McNemar test to continuous variables. We investigate the performance of the NPL and the generalized McNemar test for detecting discordance between two continuous measurements. We simulate data to mimic that of Project Phidisa. Let { Z k, k = 1, · · · , n } be the underlying true values (for example, the true viral loads) for the n subjects, and assume (5) Z k ? iid N ( ? z , ? z 2 ) . Let ( X k, Y k ) be the two measurements of Z on subject k (for example, X k the reading of viral load from EDTA, and Y k from PPT). Conditional on Z , the paired measurements follow a bivariate normal distribution, (6) ( X k Y k ) ? Z k = z ? N { ( ? x ( z ) ? y ( z ) ) , ? ( z ) } , independently for k = 1, · · · , n . The conditional covariance ?( z ) is assumed diagonal with var ( X ? Z = z ) = ? x 2 ( z ) and var ( Y ? Z = z ) = ? y 2 ( z ) . Unconditionally, X has mean E { ? x ( Z )} and variance E { ? x 2 ( Z ) } + var { ? x ( Z ) } , Y has mean E { ? y ( Z )} and variance E { ? y 2 ( Z ) } + var { ? y ( Z ) } , X and Y are correlated with cov ( X, Y ) = E { ? x ( Z ) ? y ( Z )} - E { ? x ( Z )} E { ? y ( Z )}. We set ? z = 10, ? z = 2 in ( 5 ). For the conditional distribution of X and Y in ( 6 ), we consider 4 cases. In case (I), ? x ( z ) = ? y ( z ) = z and ? x 2 ( z ) = ? y 2 ( z ) = 1 ; In case (II), ? x ( z ) = ? y ( z ) = z , ? x 2 ( z ) = 1 and ? y 2 ( z ) = 3 ; In case (III), ? x ( z ) = z, ? y ( z ) = z for z > 9 and ? y ( z ) = z + 3 for z ? 9, ? x 2 ( z ) = ? y 2 ( z ) = 1 ; In case (IV), ? x ( z ) = z, ? y ( z ) = z for z > 9 and ? y ( z ) = z + 2 for z ? 9, ? x 2 ( z ) = 1 and ? y 2 ( z ) = 3 . Therefore, X and Y agree in case (I) which is likely the situation for PPT separated versus EDTA, while X and Y disagree in the other 3 cases with (III) or (IV) likely the situation for PPT unseparated versus EDTA. There are 1000 simulations, each with n = 80 subjects. To demonstrate the performance of the tests with respect to censoring, three thresholds for left censoring are considered, C = 8.5, 9.5, 10. First, we evaluate the performances of the NPL test and the generalized McNemar test. Since H 0 implies equal marginal means, and the paired t - test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test are conventional for testing equal means of paired measurements, we compare the NPL test with them. For the t and Wilcoxon tests, values of X and Y below C are set equal to C , a naive (ad hoc) approach to deal with left censored data [ 15 ]. The empirical powers and significance levels are in Table 2 . As a likelihood based test, the NPL test is generally more powerful than the t and the Wilcoxon tests, and slightly more powerful than the generalized McNemar test. Additionally, the NPL and the generalized McNemar tests retain nominal significance as their rejection rates are all below 0.05 in case (I). The most important observation is that the NPL test maintains stable powers in case of censoring. In case (III), the NPL test keeps over 75% power to detect the discordance caused by a shift in the conditional means even at C = 10 with 50% X censored and 29% Y censored; while the power of t and Wilcoxon tests drop below 70%. In case (II), the powers of the NPL test under the censoring cases are all close to the power from complete data in detecting the discordance caused by a difference in conditional variances, while results from t and Wilcoxon tests can be misleading, e.g., at C = 10, the t - test has over 70% power to claim difference in the mean while in fact E ( X ) = E ( Y ). For the above simulation data, we compute the agreement coefficient and the linear regression coefficients in the difference plot. In the difference plot, if two variables agree, the least square (LS) linear regression of the paired differences versus the paired averages should have both intercept and slope as zero [ 9 ]. For the correlation coefficient, we use the modified concordance correlation coefficient [ 14 ], which corrects the second drawback of CCC’s that traditional CCC’s may indicate higher agreement for two measurements with more different marginal distributions. With good agreement, the modified CCC should be close to 1. Table 3 presents these estimates. It shows that both the difference plot and the agreement coefficient could be misleading with censoring. For example in case (III), the complete data would have a difference plot indicating disagreement with positive intercept (1.100, 95% confidence interval [0.680, 1.519]) and negative slope (-0.402, [-0.621, -0.189]), while the censored data at C = 10 corresponds to a difference plot with both slope and intercept near 0 indicating little disagreement. Similarly in case (III), the modified CCC for the censored data at C = 10 indicates a stronger agreement than it should be (0.554 versus 0.308). To correct for the biases in difference plot and agreement coefficient, a parametric model assumption for the censored data would be required. However, it is not always possible to obtain the correct model specification especially with large proportion of data censored. We also performed simulations where Z follows a Gamma distribution. The conclusions were quite similar to Table 2 and 3 and were omitted here for brevity.  3 Simulation Results As shown in § 2, to determine the concordance between two variables X and Y around a point s , instead of the nonparametric likelihood ratio ( 2 ), we can also use McNemar statistic ( 3 ). The consequent global test statistic is of the same form as ( 4 ) except that the supremum of the McNemar statistics over s ? ? is used. We call it the generalized McNemar test statistic, which is the generalization of McNemar test to continuous variables. We investigate the performance of the NPL and the generalized McNemar test for detecting discordance between two continuous measurements. We simulate data to mimic that of Project Phidisa. Let { Z k, k = 1, · · · , n } be the underlying true values (for example, the true viral loads) for the n subjects, and assume (5) Z k ? iid N ( ? z , ? z 2 ) . Let ( X k, Y k ) be the two measurements of Z on subject k (for example, X k the reading of viral load from EDTA, and Y k from PPT). Conditional on Z , the paired measurements follow a bivariate normal distribution, (6) ( X k Y k ) ? Z k = z ? N { ( ? x ( z ) ? y ( z ) ) , ? ( z ) } , independently for k = 1, · · · , n . The conditional covariance ?( z ) is assumed diagonal with var ( X ? Z = z ) = ? x 2 ( z ) and var ( Y ? Z = z ) = ? y 2 ( z ) . Unconditionally, X has mean E { ? x ( Z )} and variance E { ? x 2 ( Z ) } + var { ? x ( Z ) } , Y has mean E { ? y ( Z )} and variance E { ? y 2 ( Z ) } + var { ? y ( Z ) } , X and Y are correlated with cov ( X, Y ) = E { ? x ( Z ) ? y ( Z )} - E { ? x ( Z )} E { ? y ( Z )}. We set ? z = 10, ? z = 2 in ( 5 ). For the conditional distribution of X and Y in ( 6 ), we consider 4 cases. In case (I), ? x ( z ) = ? y ( z ) = z and ? x 2 ( z ) = ? y 2 ( z ) = 1 ; In case (II), ? x ( z ) = ? y ( z ) = z , ? x 2 ( z ) = 1 and ? y 2 ( z ) = 3 ; In case (III), ? x ( z ) = z, ? y ( z ) = z for z > 9 and ? y ( z ) = z + 3 for z ? 9, ? x 2 ( z ) = ? y 2 ( z ) = 1 ; In case (IV), ? x ( z ) = z, ? y ( z ) = z for z > 9 and ? y ( z ) = z + 2 for z ? 9, ? x 2 ( z ) = 1 and ? y 2 ( z ) = 3 . Therefore, X and Y agree in case (I) which is likely the situation for PPT separated versus EDTA, while X and Y disagree in the other 3 cases with (III) or (IV) likely the situation for PPT unseparated versus EDTA.

The conclusions were quite similar to Table 2 and 3 and were omitted here for brevity.  4 Case Study Our data for Project Phidisa consists of 346 HIV infected patients under antiretroviral therapy. Each patient had one plasma sample processed by EDTA, one by PPT separated, and one by PPT unseparated. Among these 346 subjects, 194 had both the PPT separated and EDTA readings below the detection limit of 50 copies/mL, and 118 had both the PPT unseparated and EDTA readings below the detection limit. Overall, more than half of the subjects had either PPT (separated or unseparated) or EDTA readings below the detection limit. This substantial censoring makes parametric approaches problematic. The goal of this study is to judge whether PPT tubes could safely substitute for EDTA tube. We investigate this separately for the PPT separated and the PPT unseparated by the NPL test. In Figure 2 are the results from the NPL test. The null distribution of the test statistic ? is estimated by the empirical distribution of ?< r >, r = 1, · · · , R , from the permutation under H 0. Here, Monte Carlo permutation with R = 2000 is used. The nonparametric likelihood ratios [?( s ) : s ? { C , x 1, · · · , x n , y 1, · · · , y n }] from the observed data, where C = log10(50), are plotted against s . Imposed over the nonparametric likelihood ratios are the respective means and 95% upper percentiles from the permuted datasets, and for clarity, the smoothed curves are plotted. Since the nonparametric likelihood ratio ?( s ) at each fixed s is asymptotically distributed as ?2(1), we thus observe the mean curve around the horizontal line of intercept 1. For the 95% upper percentiles, if at some s 0, the observed ?( s 0) is above the 95% upper percentile at s 0, it indicates F X ( s 0) ? F Y ( s 0). However, even with existence of such s 0, it does not necessarily lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis H 0. This is because the NPL test uses the global statistic ? = sup s ???( s ), and H 0 is only rejected when ?obs from the observed data is larger than the 95% upper percentile of the null distribution of ?. For the PPT separated, the null distribution density of the NPL test statistic ? is presented in Figure 2(a) , and the NPL test statistic from the observed data, ?obs, is about 8. The p-value of the NPL test from the permutation procedure of §2 is accordingly p = 0.432 and thus failing to reject the hypothesis that PPT separated and EDTA are exchangeable. For the PPT unseparated, the null distribution density of the NPL test statistic is presented in Figure 2(c) . The NPL test statistic from the observed data is about 75, which is literally off the chart. The p-value from permutation is p < 0.0005, indicating we should reject the null hypothesis and conclude that PPT unseparated cannot substitute for EDTA. Figure 2(d) further shows that discordance between the PPT unseparated and EDTA occurs around low viral loads, consistent with Figure 1 . If we try to evaluate the agreement by an agreement coefficient, its value depends on the assumed distributions for readings below the detection limit. For the PPT separated with EDTA, if the undetectable readings are assigned the value of the detection limit log10 50, the modified CCC estimate is 0.980 (with 95% confidence interval [0.975, 0.984]); if uniform distribution over interval [0, log10 50] is assumed for the undetectable readings, the modified CCC estimate is 0.903 ([0.881, 0.920]). For the PPT unseparated with EDTA, if the undetectable readings are assigned the value of the detection limit, the modified CCC estimate is 0.958 ([0.949, 0.967]); if uniform distribution over interval [0, log10 50] is assumed, the modified CCC estimate is 0.859 ([0.835, 0.879]). The CCC estimates under the two distribution assumptions are quite different. We cannot judge whether PPT can substitute for EDTA based on these estimates, since any assumed distribution for undetectable readings is not examinable. In conclusion, no discordance is detected between the PPT separated and the EDTA. However, discordance is detected between the PPT unseparated and EDTA, thus the PPT unseparated tube should not be used as a substitute for EDTA.  4 Case Study Our data for Project Phidisa consists of 346 HIV infected patients under antiretroviral therapy. Each patient had one plasma sample processed by EDTA, one by PPT separated, and one by PPT unseparated. Among these 346 subjects, 194 had both the PPT separated and EDTA readings below the detection limit of 50 copies/mL, and 118 had both the PPT unseparated and EDTA readings below the detection limit. Overall, more than half of the subjects had either PPT (separated or unseparated) or EDTA readings below the detection limit. This substantial censoring makes parametric approaches problematic. The goal of this study is to judge whether PPT tubes could safely substitute for EDTA tube. We investigate this separately for the PPT separated and the PPT unseparated by the NPL test. In Figure 2 are the results from the NPL test. The null distribution of the test statistic ? is estimated by the empirical distribution of ?< r >, r = 1, · · · , R , from the permutation under H 0. Here, Monte Carlo permutation with R = 2000 is used. The nonparametric likelihood ratios [?( s ) : s ? { C , x 1, · · · , x n , y 1, · · · , y n }] from the observed data, where C = log10(50), are plotted against s . Imposed over the nonparametric likelihood ratios are the respective means and 95% upper percentiles from the permuted datasets, and for clarity, the smoothed curves are plotted. Since the nonparametric likelihood ratio ?( s ) at each fixed s is asymptotically distributed as ?2(1), we thus observe the mean curve around the horizontal line of intercept 1. For the 95% upper percentiles, if at some s 0, the observed ?( s 0) is above the 95% upper percentile at s 0, it indicates F X ( s 0) ? F Y ( s 0). However, even with existence of such s 0, it does not necessarily lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis H 0. This is because the NPL test uses the global statistic ? = sup s ???( s ), and H 0 is only rejected when ?obs from the observed data is larger than the 95% upper percentile of the null distribution of ?. For the PPT separated, the null distribution density of the NPL test statistic ? is presented in Figure 2(a) , and the NPL test statistic from the observed data, ?obs, is about 8. The p-value of the NPL test from the permutation procedure of §2 is accordingly p = 0.432 and thus failing to reject the hypothesis that PPT separated and EDTA are exchangeable. For the PPT unseparated, the null distribution density of the NPL test statistic is presented in Figure 2(c) . The NPL test statistic from the observed data is about 75, which is literally off the chart. The p-value from permutation is p < 0.0005, indicating we should reject the null hypothesis and conclude that PPT unseparated cannot substitute for EDTA. Figure 2(d) further shows that discordance between the PPT unseparated and EDTA occurs around low viral loads, consistent with Figure 1 . If we try to evaluate the agreement by an agreement coefficient, its value depends on the assumed distributions for readings below the detection limit. For the PPT separated with EDTA, if the undetectable readings are assigned the value of the detection limit log10 50, the modified CCC estimate is 0.980 (with 95% confidence interval [0.975, 0.984]); if uniform distribution over interval [0, log10 50] is assumed for the undetectable readings, the modified CCC estimate is 0.903 ([0.881, 0.920]). For the PPT unseparated with EDTA, if the undetectable readings are assigned the value of the detection limit, the modified CCC estimate is 0.958 ([0.949, 0.967]); if uniform distribution over interval [0, log10 50] is assumed, the modified CCC estimate is 0.859 ([0.835, 0.879]). The CCC estimates under the two distribution assumptions are quite different. We cannot judge whether PPT can substitute for EDTA based on these estimates, since any assumed distribution for undetectable readings is not examinable. In conclusion, no discordance is detected between the PPT separated and the EDTA. However, discordance is detected between the PPT unseparated and EDTA, thus the PPT unseparated tube should not be used as a substitute for EDTA.  5 Discussions We proposed a nonparametric likelihood test for determining the substitutability of two methods relating to a continuous variable. It was shown that the nonparametric likelihood test is asymptotically a generalization of McNemar test, in the sense that the nonparametric likelihood ratio for evaluating the discordance between the two measurements around each point is asymptotically a McNemar statistic. An appealing aspect of the nonparametric approach is its seamless handling of censored data. For the nonparametric likelihood test discussed in this paper, the criterion for whether one method can substitute for the other is based on the equivalence of the marginal distributions, F X ( s ) = F Y ( s ) for s ? ?, which agrees with the goals specified in Project Phidisa. However, there can be other criteria for substitutability depending on the purpose of the clinical study, and the nonparametric likelihood approach can lead to other types of nonparametric tests. If at each point s , the agreement between the dichotomized measurements X s and Y s is evaluated by the probability of concordant pairs, we have the Kappa statistic [ 20 ]. The Kappa statistic at s is K ( s ) = { p o ( s ) ? p e ( s ) } ? { 1 ? p e ( s ) } , where p o ( s ) = p 00( s )+ p 11( s ) is the observed probability of concordance, and p e ( s ) = { p 00( s )+ p 01( s )}{ p 00( s )+ p 10( s )}{ p 11( s )+ p 10( s )}{ p 11( s ) + p 01( s )} is the expected probability of concordance by chance. Therefore, K ( s ) = 0 indicates concordance by pure chance and K ( s ) = 1 indicates perfect concordance where X s matches Y s . At each s , a nonparametric log likelihood ratio ? K ( s ) can be computed with respect to H 0 s : K ( s ) = 0 . Then, similar to the NPL test, a global statistic—the Kappa based nonparametric likelihood test statistic—can be defined over ? K ( s ) for s ? ?, and the test can be performed by a permutation procedure.  5 Discussions We proposed a nonparametric likelihood test for determining the substitutability of two methods relating to a continuous variable.

Proof: exchangeability F<sub>XY</sub> (x, y) = F<sub>XY</sub> (y, x) implies H<sub>0</sub> If F XY ( x, y ) = F XY ( y, x ), then for any s, F X ( s ) = F XY ( s , +?) = F XY (+?, s ), which is F Y ( s ), so H 0 is true. In fact, H 0 also implies exchangeability. By Sklar’s theorem, the bivariate distribution function F XY can be expressed by the Archimedean copula ? as, F X Y ( x , y ) = ? ? 1 { ? ( F X ( x ) ) + ? ( F Y ( y ) ) } . If H 0 is true, F X ( s ) = F Y ( s ) for all s , then F XY ( x, y ) = ?-1{?( F Y ( x )) + ?( F X ( y ))} = ?-1{?( F X ( y )) + ?( F Y ( x ))} = F XY ( y, x ), i.e., X and Y are exchangeable.  1. Proof: exchangeability F<sub>XY</sub> (x, y) = F<sub>XY</sub> (y, x) implies H<sub>0</sub> If F XY ( x, y ) = F XY ( y, x ), then for any s, F X ( s ) = F XY ( s , +?) = F XY (+?, s ), which is F Y ( s ), so H 0 is true. In fact, H 0 also implies exchangeability. By Sklar’s theorem, the bivariate distribution function F XY can be expressed by the Archimedean copula ? as, F X Y ( x , y ) = ? ? 1 { ? ( F X ( x ) ) + ? ( F Y ( y ) ) } . If H 0 is true, F X ( s ) = F Y ( s ) for all s , then F XY ( x, y ) = ?-1{?( F Y ( x )) + ?( F X ( y ))} = ?-1{?( F X ( y )) + ?( F Y ( x ))} = F XY ( y, x ), i.e., X and Y are exchangeable.  2. Proof: under H<sub>0</sub>, nonparametric likelihood ratios at two points are correlated Define ? s 1 1 ? 2 = ? 1 ? 2 ( s 1 ) , and similarly ? s 2 1 ? 2 = ? 1 ? 2 ( s 2 ) , as the square root of the nonparametric likelihood ratios at two points s 1 and s 2. Denote n s 1 = n 01( s 1)+ n 10( s 1) and similarly for n s 2, denote p ^ s 1 = p ^ ( s 1 ) and similarly for p ^ s 2 . Based on the Taylor approximation of the NPL ratios in ( 3 ), the covariance between ? s 1 1 ? 2 and ? s 2 1 ? 2 under H 0 has the following expression, cov ( ? s 1 1 ? 2 , ? s 2 1 ? 2 ) = cov { n s 1 1 ? 2 ( 2 p ^ s 1 ? 1 ) , n s 2 1 ? 2 ( 2 p ^ s 2 ? 1 ) } = E { n s 1 1 ? 2 n s 2 1 ? 2 ( 2 p ^ s 1 ? 1 ) ( 2 p ^ s 2 ? 1 ) } = E { n s 1 1 ? 2 n s 2 1 ? 2 ( 4 p ^ s 1 p ^ s 2 ? 1 ) } ? n 4 D 1 ( s 1 ) D 1 ( s 2 ) ? D 2 ( s 1 ) D 2 ( s 2 ) D 2 1 ? 2 ( s 1 ) D 2 1 ? 2 ( s 2 ) where D 1( s ) = F X ( s ) - F XY ( s, s ) and D 2( s ) = F X ( s ) + F Y ( s ) - 2 F XY ( s, s ). As shown in § 2, conditional on n s , n s 1 ? 2 ( 2 p ^ s ? 1 ) is asymptotically N(0, 1) under H 0. Since n s 1 ? 2 ( 2 p ^ s ? 1 ) has asymptotic mean 0 at both s = s 1 and s = s 2, and we have the 2nd equation . Since E { n s 1 1 ? 2 n s 2 1 ? 2 ( p ^ s 1 + p ^ s 2 ) } = E ( n s 1 1 ? 2 n s 2 1 ? 2 ) under H 0, we get the 3rd equation . In addition, cov ( ? s 1 1 ? 2 , ? s 2 1 ? 2 ) is actually the correlation coefficient between ? s 1 1 ? 2 and ? s 2 1 ? 2 , as n s 1 ? 2 ( 2 p ^ s ? 1 ) has asymptotic variance 1 at both s = s 1 and s = s 2. This correlation coefficient is generally not zero, so ? s 1 1 ? 2 and ? s 2 1 ? 2 are correlated, thus the nonparametric likelihood ratios at two points, ?( s 1) and ?( s 2), are also correlated.  2.

D 2 ( s 1 ) D 2 ( s 2 ) D 2 1 ? 2 ( s 1 ) D 2 1 ? 2 ( s 2 ) where D 1( s ) = F X ( s ) - F XY ( s, s ) and D 2( s ) = F X ( s ) + F Y ( s ) - 2 F XY ( s, s ). As shown in § 2, conditional on n s , n s 1 ? 2 ( 2 p ^ s ? 1 ) is asymptotically N(0, 1) under H 0. Since n s 1 ? 2 ( 2 p ^ s ? 1 ) has asymptotic mean 0 at both s = s 1 and s = s 2, and we have the 2nd equation . Since E { n s 1 1 ? 2 n s 2 1 ? 2 ( p ^ s 1 + p ^ s 2 ) } = E ( n s 1 1 ? 2 n s 2 1 ? 2 ) under H 0, we get the 3rd equation .
