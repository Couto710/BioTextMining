Hydrophilic Modifications of an Amphiphilic Polynorbornene and the Effects on its Hemolytic and Antibacterial Activity Here, we report the modification of an amphiphilic antibacterial polynorbornene, Poly3 , via incorporation of hydrophilic, biocompatible groups. The sugar, zwitterionic, and polyethylene glycol based moieties were incorporated in varying ratios by copolymerization and post-polymerization techniques. Well-defined copolymers with molecular weights of 3 kDa and narrow polydispersity indices from 1.08 to 1.15 were obtained. The effects of these modifications on the biological activity of these polymers were analyzed by determining their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and their hemolytic activities (HC50).  Introduction Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are part of the natural defense mechanism of many living organisms against pathogens. 1 , 2 They have broad spectrum activity and are highly selective for bacteria over mammalian cells. Though they can be found in very diverse structures, their common mechanism of action is the adoption of a specific conformation, where hydrophilic and hydrophobic components are segregated into two different faces of the molecule, which is known as facial amphiphilicity. 2 AMPs possess an overall positive charge in the hydrophilic region, which has been suggested to help them bind to the negatively charged outermost leaflet of the bacterial membrane through electrostatic attractions. These nonspecific interactions and the versatility of the AMPs have been proposed to limit bacterial resistance to them. 2 All these distinctive properties of AMPs led to increased interest in new synthetic mimics of antimicrobial peptides (SMAMPs), which include peptoids, 3 – 5 ?- and ?-amino acids, 6 – 13 aromatic oligomers, 14 – 16 and synthetic polymers. 17 – 24 The first example of SMAMPs, based on ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), was reported by Ilker et al, 21 where a series of polymers was synthesized by varying the hydrophobicity of the backbone, at the repeat unit level, to tune the hemolytic and antibacterial properties of the facially amphiphilic polymers. It was shown that these SMAMPs could be transformed from non-selectively active (biocidal) to antimicrobial but non-hemolytic with changes in the backbone hydrophobicity. The most potent SMAMP was Poly3 ( Figure 1 ), with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) a of 25 ?g/mL but selectivity b of less than 1 due to the large hydrophobic groups. In an attempt to improve the selectivity of this SMAMP, the effects of increasing the charge density were studied by Al-Badri et al. 25 The number of amine groups on the polymer was varied by introducing groups carrying one, two, and three amines per repeat unit, while keeping the backbone structure constant. It was concluded that increasing the number of amine groups on the polymer resulted in a reduction of its hemolytic activity, thus increased selectivity was gained. Here, we report an alternative approach to fine-tune the properties of this interesting polymer, Poly3 , by incorporating hydrophilic, biocompatible functionalities including sugar, zwitterionic, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties ( Figure 1 ). Carbohydrate based sugars, in addition to being used as solubilizing agents, play an important role in application areas of bio-molecular chemistry. 26 , 27 PEG and various zwitterions have been widely used for improving the water-solubility of compounds. 28 , 29 Having similar properties, all these groups have been routinely employed in conjunction with each other as solubilizing agents in many biological systems, 28 , 30 , 31 where they were found to be non-toxic, thus making them good candidates for this study. The importance of repeat unit level facial amphiphilicity, rather than globally (or the entire molecule), on the selectivity of SMAMPs was recently emphasized by Lienkamp et al. 23 Easily synthesizable structures that contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic units on the same monomer allowed successful tuning of the SMAMPs’ selectivities. Gabriel et al. also emphasized the advantages of the facial amphiphilicity approach at the repeat unit level versus random copolymers of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers. 32 Therefore in this study, facially amphiphilic monomers having the same hydrophobic backbone, but various hydrophilic pendant groups, were incorporated into Poly3 via ROMP ( Figure 1 ). The resulting effects on the overall biological activities of these polymers were studied via determination of MICs coupled with hemolytic activity (HC50) studies.

Corresponding monomers were mixed in the same reaction vessel prior to reacting with the catalyst. Copolymers with varying compositions were synthesized by adjusting the molar amounts of the monomers at the desired ratios.

Synthesis of <bold>Poly3</bold>-co-<bold>PolyP</bold> A post-functionalization approach was utilized for the synthesis of Poly3 -co- PolyP copolymer. Poly3 was synthesized and deprotected according to a previous literature procedure. 34 The repeat unit determination was done by GPC analysis. In a typical reaction, deprotected Poly3 (0.15 g, 0.4 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL DMSO. Triethyl amine (0.02 g, 0.20 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 30 min followed by the addition of PEG-acrylate (0.15 g, 0.3 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. The pure polymer was isolated by crystallization three times from cold diethyl ether affording a light brown solid. Yield: 70%. Copolymer composition was determined by the ratio of the integration values of methyl protons of the backbone (6H) appearing at 0.75 ppm to the methylene peaks next to the ester linkage of the PEG-acrylate (2H) appearing at 4.07 ppm. 1H NMR (300 MHz, D2O) ?: 0.85 (br m, 6H), 2.42 (br m, 1H), 2.84 (br m, 2H), 3.05 (br m, 2H), 3.15 (br m, 3H, -C H 3 of PEG), 3.46 (br m, 32H), 3.55 (br m, 2H), 4.07 (br m, 2H, -COOC H 2-), 5.18 (br m, 1H), 5.48 (br m, 1H), 7.10 (br m, 5H, aromatic).  Results and Discussion Polymer Synthesis and Characterization It has been previously reported that the facial amphiphilicity at the repeat unit level has an important effect on the overall selectivity of the SMAMPs compared to random copolymers of hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers, yielding an amphiphilic structure. 21 , 23 , 32 , 35 Selectivity values were improved in the prior cases by fine tuning of these systems by copolymerization. Therefore, to preserve the facial amphiphilicity at the repeat unit level, in this study, monomers composed of the same hydrophobic backbone and varying biocompatible hydrophilic pendant moieties were designed and synthesized ( Figure 1 ). ROMP has been successfully used to polymerize norbornene based monomers bearing various functionalities to obtain well-defined systems. 24 , 34 , 36 – 38 However, it has been also reported that the presence of particular additives such as pyridine, secondary amines, thiols, or benzoic acid, can significantly slow or shut down the kinetics of ROMP. 39 , 40 Therefore, to prevent these retardation effects and to be able to successfully perform ROMP, a protecting group approach was utilized to synthesize the highly functionalized monomers ( M1–M3 ). In addition to facilitating the polymerization process, the protective group approach also provided ease in the later polymer characterization by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Upon complete polymerization, the protective groups were removed to yield the corresponding antimicrobially active polymers. The first step of the monomer synthesis is the Diels-Alder reaction of maleimide with isopropylfulvene to yield product 1. M1 , the sugar functional norbornene based monomer, was synthesized via Misunobu coupling 41 of 1 with the corresponding alcohol ( Scheme 1 ). The same reaction conditions were employed to obtain 2 , which was further alkylated with 4-bromobutanoic acid tert -butyl ester to yield the positively charged M2 as the quaternary ammonium salt, leading to the zwitterionic functionality upon deprotection ( Scheme 1 ). 40 M3 was synthesized according to a previously published procedure. 34 All monomers were characterized using NMR techniques. Figure 2 and 3 show the resulting 1H NMR spectra of M1 and M2 , respectively. All homopolymers ( Poly1 , Poly2 , and Poly3 ) and copolymers ( Poly3 n - co - Poly1 m , Poly3 n co - Poly2 m , and Poly3 n - co - PolyP m, where n indicates the mol fraction of M3 and m indicates the mol fraction of M1 , M2 , or MP (PEG functionality) in the copolymer composition) were synthesized using 3rd generation Grubbs’ catalyst as an initiator. Upon reaction completion, the polymerizations were terminated via addition of excess ethyl vinyl ether. ROMP yielded polymers with approximate molecular weights of 3 kDa and narrow polydispersity indices ranging from 1.08 to 1.15, as determined by GPC (See Table 1 ). All polymers were deprotected using trifluoroacetic acid to obtain the antimicrobially active polymers. Syntheses of Poly3 n - co - Poly1 m (sugar functional) and Poly3 n - co - Poly2 m (zwitterionic functional) copolymers were done via random copolymerization of the corresponding facially amphiphilic monomers. To vary the amphiphilicity of the resulting polymers, different molar ratios of the monomers were used in the copolymerization reactions ( Table 1 and Table S1 ). Depending on the solubility of the monomers and the catalyst, different solvent systems were used to provide homogeneous reaction media for all polymerizations. Poly3 n - co - Poly1 m was synthesized using only THF, whereas Poly3 n - co - Poly2 m was synthesized in a THF-methanol solvent mixture ( Scheme 2 ). The copolymerization kinetics were studied via 1H NMR analysis by recording spectra every 30 minutes, until the reaction was completed within 2 h. The constant decrease in the intensity of the broad peak at 6.5 ppm, corresponding to the alkene functionalities of both norbornene monomers, indicated successful copolymer formation. The complete disappearance of the same peak and the simultaneous appearance of two new peaks at approximately 5.4 and 5.6 ppm, corresponding to the cis and trans conformations of double bonds of the polymer backbone, indicated complete conversion. Molecular weight characterization of Poly3 n - co - Poly1 m was done by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with THF as the eluent, and calibration was done against polystyrene standards. The experimental molecular weights were in accordance with the theoretical (calculated) values ( Table 1 and Table S1 ). Representative GPC traces of Poly1 (homopolymer of M1) and the copolymer, Poly3 0.5 - co - Poly1 0.5 , are shown in the Supporting Information . It is well known that GPC of charged polymers is challenging due to formation of ionic aggregation or interactions with the stationary phase of the chromatography column. 42 Therefore, instead of performing GPC analysis on the charged polymers, 1H NMR end group analysis was used for the molecular weight determination of Poly3 n - co - Poly2 m copolymers. The ratio of the phenyl end group integral value to the methyl protons of the isopropylfulvene backbone yielded the degree of polymerization, which was used to calculate the total molecular weight of the polymers. It has been previously reported that PEO containing norbornenes polymerized via ROMP yielded polymers with very broad PDIs (~1.6) and multimodal molecular weight distributions. 36 , 43 To prevent these complications and to obtain well-defined systems for the biological activity analysis, an alternative approach was employed for the synthesis of the Poly3 n - co - PolyP m copolymers. Prior to any functionalization, M3 was polymerized to yield Boc -protected Poly3 which was then deprotected with TFA to yield the antimicrobially active polymer according to the previously published procedure. 34 Positively charged ammonium groups were neutralized to yield the amine functionalities, which were then used to react with the acrylate end functionalized PEG via Michael-addition ( Scheme 3 ). 44 In the 1H NMR spectra of the purified polymers no residual acrylate peaks were observed and the appearance of a peak at 4.07 ppm corresponding to the methylene peaks next to the ester linkage of the PEG-acrylate indicated the successful addition. Due to relatively lower yields obtained in this specific reaction, only copolymers containing up to 50% PEG functionality were synthesized. Antimicrobial and Hemolytic Activity Analyses To assess the biological activities of the polymers, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against Eschericia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and hemolytic activity (HC50) were determined according to standard procedures. 45 All of the analyses were performed using the deprotected polymer samples. Figure 4 shows the results of the Poly3 n co - Poly1 m series. As the sugar content of the copolymer was increased from 0% to 100% (referring to the Poly1 homopolymer), a linear decrease in the biological activity was observed; MIC values increased from 50 to 200 ?g/mL. This loss of activity might be attributed to the fact that, as the number of repeat units containing sugar residues is increased, the overall positive charge of the polymer is being reduced. It should also be noted that the sugar functional homopolymer, Poly1 , is less active towards bacteria. However, due to its biocompatible nature and overall neutral charge, its toxicity toward mammalian cells, HC50 = 2000 ?g/mL, is much lower than that of Poly3 , HC50 < 1 ?g/mL. Thus, while increasing the sugar content of the Poly3 n - co - Poly1 m copolymers improved their hemolytic properties, it caused a reduction of the antibacterial activities. The same behavior was observed for the Poly3 n - co - Poly2 m copolymer series until equal co-monomer composition was reached ( Poly3 0.5 - co - Poly2 0.5) ( Figure 5 ). As the number of zwitterionic residues was further increased, loss of antimicrobial activity along with higher hemolytic activity was observed. A reasonable explanation for the loss of activity with higher zwitterionic content could be the increased formation of intra- or interchain associations, causing significant conformational changes in the polymer backbone, thus affecting overall facial amphiphilicity. The highest biological activity was observed for Poly3 n -co- PolyP m samples ( Figure 6 ). Upon incorporation of PEG groups up to 30%, lower MIC values were obtained compared to Poly3 , accompanied with a slight improvement in the hemolytic activities. Compared to the sugar or zwitterionic functionalized copolymers, the presence of an amine (primary or secondary) on every repeat unit in the Poly3 n -co- PolyP m structures, indicate that the overall charge remained constant even as PEG content increased. However, after 50% functionalization the same loss of activity was observed as for the other polymers. Table 1 summarizes the resulting MIC and HC50 values of all the studied SMAMPs, as well as the selectivity values, calculated taking the ratio of HC50 and MIC. When the results are compared to that of Poly3, generally the same behavior is observed for all the samples; with increasing hydrophilicity, biological activity is reduced. However, due to the biocompatible nature of these hydrophilic groups, improvements of the hemolytic activities were observed (from <0.02 up to 7.5 ?g/mL for Poly3 0.5 - co - Poly2 0.5) , thus higher selectivities were obtained.

When the results are compared to that of Poly3, generally the same behavior is observed for all the samples; with increasing hydrophilicity, biological activity is reduced. However, due to the biocompatible nature of these hydrophilic groups, improvements of the hemolytic activities were observed (from <0.02 up to 7.5 ?g/mL for Poly3 0.5 - co - Poly2 0.5) , thus higher selectivities were obtained.  Conclusions An amphiphilic polynorbornene derivative, Poly3 , was modified by successful incorporation of hydrophilic, biocompatible groups via copolymerization of the corresponding monomers or post-polymerization functionalization. Biological activities of these SMAMPs were studied and it was observed that increasing the hydrophilicity reduced the antibacterial properties, which could be interpreted as resulting from the overall charge reduction. However, the hydrophilicity of the biocompatible groups reduces the hemolytic activities of the new polymers, thus improved selectivities were obtained. The obtained selectivities remained modest compared to other recent norbornene-based polymers reported from our laboratory, which in general gave selectivities of ~250 32 – 500 23 . Those polymers were significantly more potent with single ?g/mL MIC’s.  Supplementary Material 1_si_001
