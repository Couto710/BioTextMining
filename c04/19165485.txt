Interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R) gene polymorphisms in acquired aplastic anemia Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare disease with a complex pathogenesis. In most cases, T-cell mediated immune destruction of hematopoietic cells results in peripheral blood pancytopenia and bone marrow hypoplasia. Asubset of the heterodimeric interleukin-23 receptor gene ( IL-23R ) is significantly associated with autoimmune-mediated diseases. To examine whether IL-23R single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) might contribute to AA, we selected three IL-23R SNPs with amino-acid changes (rs11209026: p.Arg381Gln; rs41313262: p.Val362Ile; rs11465797: p.Thr175Asn), and compared their frequencies in279 AA patients and 184 ethnicallymatched healthy controls. The three SNP prevalences were similar between the AApatients and controls. The Arg381Gln variant, which has a strong protective effect against inflammatory bowel disease, showed no association with AA. Further, IL-23 levels in sera were measured in the AA patients and in controls, and there were no significant differences among them. Our results indicatethat these three IL-23R SNPs and serum IL-23 level have no apparent impact onsusceptibility to AA.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients and controls Peripheral blood (PB) samples were obtained from 279 unrelated consecutive patients diagnosed with AA (133 females and 146 males), according to the criteria of the International Agranulocytosis and AA Study. These AA patients were treated at a single institution (Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health), and composed of four ethnic groups (159 Caucasians (57.0%), 33African-Americans (11.8%), 49 Hispanics (17.6%), and 33Asians(13.6%)). Blood samples from ethnically matched 184 healthy donors (117 Caucasians (63.6%), 23 African-Americans (12.5%), 22 Hispanics (12.0%), and 22 Asians (12.0%) from SNP-500Cancer) [ 18 ] served as controls. Patients or their guardians provided written informed consent for genetic testing, according to protocols approved by the institutional review board of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. DNA amplification and sequencing DNA was extracted from PB mononuclear cells using the Qiagen DNA extraction kit and subjected to PCR amplification using the LA Taq polymerase kit (Takara, Otsu, Japan) and adequate primer sets in order to obtain DNA fragments containing SNPs (rs11209026, rs41313262, and rs11465797).

Sequencing data were aligned and compared using the SeqMan program (DYNASTER, Madison, WI). Cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Sera were obtained from 23 AA patients with IL-23R polymorphisms, 37 AA patients without polymorphisms, and 21 healthy controls. IL-23 serum levels were measured using the Human Interleukin 23 (Hu IL-23) Heterodimer ELISA kit (BioSource, Camarillo, CA), following the manufacturer’s recommendations. All samples were assayed in duplicate. Statistical analysis Summary statistics, such as proportions and p-values were used to describe the related variables. Statistical analysis was performed by ?2 tests with a significance level of P < 0.05, for SNPs and for ELISA data. All numerical results were computed using Splus 8 (Insightful Corp, Seattle, WA) and NCSS, PASS (Hintze. J, (2006). NCSS, PASS, and GESS. NCSS, Kaysville, Utah) for Windows statistical software.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To assess the contribution of IL-23 SNPs to AA susceptibility and phenotype, we first targeted the non-synonymous rs11209026 SNP (c.1142G>A, p.Arg381Gln) because of its strong association withIBD [ 10 ]. In addition, we examined allele frequencies of two non-synonymous SNPs, rs41313262 (c.1084G>A, p.Val362Ile) and rs11465797 (c.524C>A, p.Thr175Asn). Genotype frequencies of the three IL-23R polymorphisms examined in AA patients and healthy controls are shown in Table 1 , together with demographic and clinical features. The p.Arg381Gln variant was present in 6.1% ofAA patients and in 6.0% ofethnically matched controls ( P = 0.960; ?-error =0.16). The carrier frequencyof the p.Val362Ile (rs41313262) variant was low, but similar inAA patients (2.2%) and controls (1.6%) ( P = 0.958); the p.Thr175Asn (rs11465797) variant was not observed in patients or controls. No homozygous carriers of the p.Arg381Gln or p.Val362Ile variant were found in either AA patients or controls. All carriers had only a single SNP, except one with two SNPs. We performed ELISA analysis to measure IL-23 levels in sera of 23 AA patients with SNP polymorphisms and 37 AA patients without polymorphisms, and compared results with those of 21 healthy controls ( Figure 1 ). There wereno statistical differences among thethree groups, even after stratifying AA patients according to treatment status. Collectively, our dataindicatethat the Arg381Gln SNP did not correlate withsusceptibility ofAA. The IL-23/IL-17-mediated inflammatory axis has been implicated in numerous autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions. A series of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-21, TGF-?, and IL-23, sequentially or synergistically induce Th17 lineage cells, together with the cooperative action of transcription factors[ 11 ]. Conversely, other cytokines, including IL-2, IL-4, IFN-?, and IL-27, antagonize differentiation of the Th17 lineage and inhibit IL-17 and IL-23 production. In AA patients, increased productionof type 1 cytokines (IFN-?, TNF, and IL-2) from T cells has seenobserved, implicating that the hematopoietic cell destruction bya Th1 T-cellresponse [ 9 , 23 ], which includes boththe Fas-mediated cell death and the inhibition of hematopoieticstem cell proliferation [ 30 ]. Our previous work has suggestedthat T-bet mediated IFN-? elevation is responsible for the Th1 shift of CD4+ T cells in AA patients. As CD4+ effecter T cells were shifted to Th1 cells in AA patients, the IL-23/IL-17-mediated inflammatory axis might be suppressed in AA, due to antagonistic effect ofTh1 cytokines onTh17 differentiation and development. Therefore, it is consistent that IL-23R SNPs have no significant association with AA, although it cannot be excluded that other IL-23R SNPs as well as IL-23R isoforms (differentially expressed in distinct cell types) might play protective roles. In other autoimmune diseases such as MS, RA, and SLE, similar results have beenobtained, IL23R polymorphisms had no significant correlation with susceptibility or severity of disease [ 2 , 17 , 22 ], in agreement withour results. It has beensuggestedthat the IL23R polymorphisms might play a more important role in regulating local inflammation, as in IBD and psoriasis, rather than in systemic inflammation in RA and SLE, supported by some work in mouse models [ 28 ]. Further, the IL-23-pathway molecules have no association with SLE; type I cytokines, which are not induced withIL-23, are relevant in the development and maintenance of this disease [ 1 , 20 ]. AA patients may share a common background of genetic risk affecting disease development and severity, which may be similar to some other autoimmune diseases and completely different from others. Further genetic studies are required to investigate as yet unidentified causal genetic alleles responsible for AA.
