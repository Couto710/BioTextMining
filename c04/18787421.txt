Genetic Contributions to Disparities in Preterm Birth Ethnic disparity in preterm delivery between African Americans and European Americans has existed for decades, and is likely the consequence of multiple factors, including socioeconomic status, access to care, environment, and genetics. This review summarizes existing information on genetic variation and its association with preterm birth in African Americans. Candidate gene-based association studies, in which investigators have evaluated particular genes selected primarily because of their potential roles in the process of normal and pathological parturition, provide evidence that genetic contributions from both mother and fetus account for some of the disparity in preterm births. To date, most attention has been focused on genetic variation in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine genes and their respective receptors. These genes, particularly the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes and their receptors, are linked to matrix metabolism since these cytokines increase expression of matrix degrading metalloproteinases. However, the role that genetic variants that are different between populations play in preterm birth cannot yet be quantified. Future studies based on genome wide association or admixture mapping may reveal other genes that contribute to disparity in prematurity.  CONCLUSIONS Ethnic disparities in preterm birth may result from multiple factors. Although existing studies can be criticized based on study design, there is accumulating evidence that genetic contributions from both mother and fetus account for some of the disparity in preterm birth between African Americans and European Americans. Ethnic differences in allele and or haplotype frequencies have been reported for the TNFA , and IL6 genes, and their receptors, but the inconsistent finding on their association with preterm birth suggests that independently, these genes are not strong determinants of preterm birth. It is possible that any effects that these genes have on prematurity results from interaction with other genes or with environmental factors. The SERPINH1 -656T allele, which is enriched in African populations and African Americans, is an example of an ancestry-informative marker associated with preterm birth in African Americans. Future studies based on genome wide association or admixture mapping may reveal other genes that contribute to disparity in prematurity.
