T-bet and Eomesodermin Play Critical Roles in Directing T Cell Differentiation to Th1 versus Th17 1 Th1 and Th17 cells are crucial in immune regulation and autoimmune disease development. By adding Stat6 deficiency to T-bet deficiency, and thus negating effects from elevated levels of IL-4/Stat6/GATA3 Th2 signals in T-bet-deficient cells, we investigated the signals important for Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation and their role in colitis development. The data reveal that Eomesodermin compensates T-bet deficiency for IFN- ? and Th1 development. However, without T-bet, IFN- ? production and Th1 differentiation are susceptible to inhibition by IL-6 and TGF ? . As a result, Th17 development is strongly favored, the threshold for TGF ? requirement is lowered, and IL-6 drives Th17 differentiation, elucidating a critical role for T-bet in directing T cell differentiation to Th1 vs Th17. In contrast to IL-6 plus TGF ? -driven Th17, IL-6-driven Th17 cells do not express IL-10 and they induce a more intense colitis. Naive CD4 T cells deficient in Stat6 and T-bet also induce a Th17-dominant colitis development in vivo. Our data provide new insights into the choice between Th1 and Th17 development and their roles in autoimmunity.

CD4+CD25– T cells from wild-type, T-bet KO, and Stat6 and T-bet DKO mice were purified and stimulated with anti-CD3 mAbs in the presence of T cell-depleted splenocytes as accessory cells (APC), plus low concentrations of IL-2, along with IL-12, IFN- ? , or IL-4. After 4 days of culture, intracellular staining was performed to measure IFN- ? and IL-4 expression. In agreement with a previous report ( 10 ), blocking the IL-4/Th2 pathway enabled T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells to respond to IL-12 for IFN- ? induction ( Fig. 1 A ), confirming that IL-12 could induce T-bet independent of IFN- ? expression. Stat6 deficiency did not fully restore the IL-12-driven IFN- ? response, with 15.4% IFN- ? expressing cells in DKO compared with 48.1% in wild-type cells ( Fig. 1 A ). Similar results were observed with an APC-independent culture system in which CD4+CD25– T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 plus soluble anti-CD28 mAbs (data not shown). Dose-response analysis further confirmed that IL-12-induced, T-bet-independent, IFN- ? production was reduced ( Fig. 1 B ). Exogenous IFN- ? -driven IFN- ? production is dependent on T-bet ( Fig. 1 A ). There was very limited IL-4 expression in DKO CD4 T cells ( Fig. 1, A and B ), with or without exogenous IL-4, suggesting that decreased IFN- ? induction by IL-12 was not due to inhibition from IL-4/Th2 signals. Real-time RT-PCR showed that there was no IL-12R ? 2 expression in T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells, while Stat6 deficiency restored IL-12R ? 2 expression, and IL-12R ? 2 expression was comparable in wild-type and DKO cells ( Fig. 1 C ), indicating that reduced IFN- ? induction by IL-12 was not due to differential IL-12R ? 2 transcription. There was very little GATA-3 expressed in Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4 T cells, and it was suppressed by IL-12 to similarly low levels in wild-type CD4 T cells ( Fig. 1 C ), indicating that reduced IFN- ? induction by IL-12 was also not due to increased GATA-3 expression. TCR activation alone in APC-independent cultures that lack IL-12 induced low but significant IFN- ? ( Fig. 1 B ). This indicated that TCR activation itself drives IFN- ? expression, independent of either T-bet or IL-12/Stat4. The finding that TCR stimulation and IL-12 both induced less IFN- ? in DKO compared with wild-type CD4 T cells suggests that although the requirement for T-bet may not be absolute, T-bet plays a major regulatory role for IFN- ? production independent of its effects on IL-12R ? 2 or GATA-3. Eomes compensates for T-bet in IFN-? expression in CD4 T cells Since TCR activation induced IFN- ? expression independent of both T-bet and IL-12/Stat4, this suggested another pathway for IFN- ? regulation. Eomes plays a complementary role for T-bet in IFN- ? regulation in CD8 T cells ( 11 – 13 ). We examined if Eomes also plays a role for CD4 IFN- ? regulation. Real-time RT-PCR for Eomes expression was performed on wild-type, T-bet-deficient, and Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4+CD25– T cells after 2 days of stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2 A , there were much higher levels of Eomes expression in stimulated DKO CD4 T cells compared with wild-type or T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells, suggesting that similar to T-bet, Eomes was also inhibited by IL-4/Stat6/GATA-3. Examination of Eomes expression in naive CD4+CD25– and CD8 T cells showed that its expression in CD4 T cells is very limited compared with CD8 T cells, and Stat6 and T-bet double deficiency did not affect expression ( Fig. 2 A ), indicating that higher levels in stimulated CD4 T cells were not due to abnormal basal expression. Expression levels of IFN- ? , Eomes, IL-12R ? 2, and GATA-3 were compared after 24 and 48 h of activation. As shown in Fig. 2 B , TCR and IL-12 induced rapid Eomes and IFN- ? expression by 24 h of activation, significant IL-12R ? 2 expression was observed 48 h after stimulation, and there was no difference in GATA-3 expression between 24 and 48 h in DKO CD4 T cells. This suggested that Eomes, but not IL-12R ? 2 or GATA-3, played a role in the early IFN- ? response. Bicistronic GFP retroviral vectors expressing Eomes or T-bet were used to transduce Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4 T cells to determine whether T-bet or Eomes directly regulated IFN- ? . GFP+ and GFP– cells were purified by flow cytometric sorting. Real-time RT-PCR confirmed that retroviral infection resulted in a >100-fold increase in T-bet or Eomes expression (data not shown). After resting for 2 days, cells were restimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAbs for another 2 days. Intracellular staining showed that both GFP-Eomes+ and GFP-T-bet+ cells had marked IFN- ? production ( Fig. 2 C ). These data indicated that both T-bet and Eomes directly up-regulated IFN- ? expression, and the failure to observe Eomes for CD4 IFN- ? responses in T-bet-deficient cells was likely to due to its repression by elevated IL-4/Stat6/GATA-3 Th2 signals. T-bet-independent IFN-? and Th1 development are very susceptible to suppression by IL-6 and TGF? Th17 development is driven by the combination of IL-6 plus TGF ? signals. We examined if Stat6/T-bet DKO T cells respond differently to Th17 polarizing signals. CD4+CD25– wild-type and DKO cells were cultured in APC-dependent or -independent conditions, with combinations of IL-6, TGF ? , or IL-12. As shown in Fig. 3 A , IFN- ? expression is more susceptible to inhibition by IL-6 and TGF ? in DKO compared with wild-type cells. IL-6 or TGF ? alone completely abolished IFN- ? production, and exogenous IL-12 failed to restore IFN- ? production. IL-6 plus TGF ? also induced much higher levels of IL-17 in DKO than in wild-type cells. IL-12 only partially inhibited IL-17 expression. These data indicated that without T-bet, Th1 differentiation was susceptible to suppression from Th17 polarizing signals, and Th17 development was strongly favored. Since Eomes compensated for T-bet for IFN- ? transcription ( Fig. 2 ), we examined if susceptibility to suppression of IFN- ? production was related to Eomes inhibition. IL-6 and TGF ? both inhibited Eomes expression in both DKO and wild-type cells ( Fig. 3 B ). In CD8 T cells, which express higher levels of Eomes, IL-6 or IL-6 combined with TGF ? inhibited IFN- ? , induced higher levels of IL-17, and inhibited Eomes to a greater degree in DKO compared with wild-type T cells ( Fig. 3, C and D ). Forced Eomes expression in DKO CD4 T cells suppresses IL-17 expression while it prevents IL-6- and TGF ? -mediated IFN- ? inhibition ( Fig. 3 E ). Taken together, these data indicated that both T-bet and Eomes protected Th1 from Th17 polarization, and inhibition of Eomes by Th17 polarizing signals leads to preferential Th17 development in the absence of T-bet. Stat6 and T-bet double deficiencies enable IL-6 to initiate Th17 cell differentiation IL-6 treatment induced IL-17 production in DKO CD4 and CD8 T cells ( Fig. 3, A , B , and D ). Real-time RT-PCR showed that IL-6 induced IL-17A and IL-17F transcripts, as well as ROR ? T ( Fig. 4 A ). IL-17 polarization is dependent on TGF ? ( 25 – 30 ); however, IL-6 alone induced IL-17 expression in APC-independent conditions, and there was no difference in TGF ? expression in wild-type compared with DKO CD4 T cells ( Fig. 4 A ). FoxP3-expressing regulatory CD4 T cells are suggested to be a source for TGF ? in Th17 and regulatory T cell differentiation ( 34 ); however, intracellular staining showed no FoxP3-expressing cells in either wild-type or DKO CD4+CD25– T cells after IL-6 stimulation ( Fig. 4 B ). To further investigate if IL-6 mediated IL-17 expression, neutralizing anti-TGF ? Abs were added to cultures. As shown in Fig. 4 C , 0.05 ? g/ml anti-TGF ? significantly inhibited IL-6-driven IL-17 expression, but there was still low but consistent IL-17 expression even in the presence of the highest concentrations of anti-TGF ? Abs (5 ? g/ml). Real-time RT-PCR also showed that at a dose as low as 0.05 ? g/ml, anti-TGF ? reduced expression of IL-17A and IL-17F, yet the highest concentrations of anti-TGF ? Ab did not fully extinguish IL-17 expression ( Fig. 4 D ). Collectively, these data indicated that CD4 T cells deficient in both Stat6 and T-bet are much more sensitive to IL-6 for Th17 development. IL-23 promotes IL-6-driven Th17 differentiation IL-23 promotes Th17 survival, expansion, and phenotype maintenance ( 12 , 23 , 24 ). IL-23 induced very little IL-17 expression, indicating that Stat6 and T-bet double deficiencies do not autoinitiate Th17 development ( Fig. 5 A ). When combined with IL-6, IL-23 significantly enhanced IL-6-driven IL-17 expression, even in the presence of high concentrations of anti-TGF ? neutralizing Abs. IL-21 negatively regulates IFN- ? expression through Eomes inhibition ( 15 ), and IL-6 alone inhibited Eomes ( Fig. 3, B and D ). We investigated if Eomes inhibition by IL-21 may lead to IL-17 induction. IL-21 did inhibit Eomes expression, but it induced far less IL-17 compared with IL-6 in DKO CD4 T cells ( Fig. 5, B and C ). When IL-21 was combined with IL-23, significant IL-17 expression was observed, further indicating that Eomes inhibition played a role in Th17 differentiation. IL-21 did not potentiate IL-6- or IL-6 plus IL-23-driven IL-17 induction. This suggested that IL-6 and IL-21 may use the same pathways to regulate IL-17, likely through Stat3 induction and Eomes inhibition. IL-6 drives pathogenic Th17 cell generation In addition to IL-17, recent studies demonstrated that IL-6 combined with TGF ? also induces IL-10, and IL-10 in turn restrains the pathologic effects of IL-17 ( 31 , 32 ). To determine whether IL-6-driven Th17 cells also expressed IL-10, cells were stimulated with IL-6, TGF ? , and/or IL-23 ( Fig. 6 A ). Only IL-6 plus TGF ? induced both IL-17 and IL-10, while IL-6 alone or IL-6 plus IL-23 induced only IL-17 without IL-10. In the SCID adoptive transfer colitis model, IL-6-cultured Th17 induced more severe colitis than did IL-6 plus TGF ? -cultured Th17 cells. Immunohistochemistry for CD4 and CD11c showed many more infiltrating cells in colons of mice receiving IL-6-cultured Th17 (not shown), and real-time RT-PCR showed significantly more IL-17 expression ( Fig. 6 B ). Stat6 and T-bet DKO CD4 T cells induce Th17-dominant colitis development To determine whether Th17-dominant responses by DKO CD4 T cells occurred in vivo, wild-type, T-bet-deficient, and Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4+CD25–CD45RBhigh T cells were purified and transferred into SCID mice, and body weight and the development of colitis were monitored. Recipients of wild-type CD4 T cells had weight loss and development of colitis within 8 wk, whereas T-bet deficiency abolished colitis development, as previously reported ( 17 ). Transfer of DKO cells also led to weight loss and colitis. Colitis induced by transfer of wild-type or DKO CD4 T cells was similar in degree ( Fig. 7, A and B ). Immunohistochemistry for CD4 and CD11c showed similar patterns and numbers of CD4 and DC infiltration ( Fig. 7 C ). These results suggested that relieving IL-4/Stat6 Th2 signals in T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells enabled them to be pathologically active. To determine whether colitis induced by Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4 T cells was due to Th1 or Th17 cell generation, lamina propria lymphocytes were purified and IFN- ? and IL-17 expression examined by real-time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 7 D , there were striking differences in IFN- ? and IL-17 expression. Stat6/T-bet DKO colitis T cells expressed little IFN- ? but much more IL-17 than did wild-type colitogenic T cells, indicating that Th17 development also occurred in vivo. There was also no IL-10 expression, suggesting the induction of pathogenic IL-10– Th17. Administration of anti-IL-17 neutralizing mAbs at days 0 and 7 significantly attenuated Stat6/T-bet DKO cell-induced colitis, but not wild-type CD4 T cell-induced colitis ( Fig. 7 E ). Similarly, administration of anti-IL-6 mAbs on days 0, 7, and 14 after adoptive transfer completely prevented colitis ( Fig. 7 F ). Thus, there is an in vivo process permitting the development of IL-6-dependent colitogenic Th17 without IL-10 production.  Results Stat6 deficiency enables T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells to produce IFN-? CD4+CD25– T cells from wild-type, T-bet KO, and Stat6 and T-bet DKO mice were purified and stimulated with anti-CD3 mAbs in the presence of T cell-depleted splenocytes as accessory cells (APC), plus low concentrations of IL-2, along with IL-12, IFN- ? , or IL-4. After 4 days of culture, intracellular staining was performed to measure IFN- ? and IL-4 expression. In agreement with a previous report ( 10 ), blocking the IL-4/Th2 pathway enabled T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells to respond to IL-12 for IFN- ? induction ( Fig. 1 A ), confirming that IL-12 could induce T-bet independent of IFN- ? expression. Stat6 deficiency did not fully restore the IL-12-driven IFN- ? response, with 15.4% IFN- ? expressing cells in DKO compared with 48.1% in wild-type cells ( Fig. 1 A ). Similar results were observed with an APC-independent culture system in which CD4+CD25– T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 plus soluble anti-CD28 mAbs (data not shown). Dose-response analysis further confirmed that IL-12-induced, T-bet-independent, IFN- ? production was reduced ( Fig. 1 B ). Exogenous IFN- ? -driven IFN- ? production is dependent on T-bet ( Fig. 1 A ). There was very limited IL-4 expression in DKO CD4 T cells ( Fig. 1, A and B ), with or without exogenous IL-4, suggesting that decreased IFN- ? induction by IL-12 was not due to inhibition from IL-4/Th2 signals. Real-time RT-PCR showed that there was no IL-12R ? 2 expression in T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells, while Stat6 deficiency restored IL-12R ? 2 expression, and IL-12R ? 2 expression was comparable in wild-type and DKO cells ( Fig. 1 C ), indicating that reduced IFN- ? induction by IL-12 was not due to differential IL-12R ? 2 transcription. There was very little GATA-3 expressed in Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4 T cells, and it was suppressed by IL-12 to similarly low levels in wild-type CD4 T cells ( Fig. 1 C ), indicating that reduced IFN- ? induction by IL-12 was also not due to increased GATA-3 expression. TCR activation alone in APC-independent cultures that lack IL-12 induced low but significant IFN- ? ( Fig. 1 B ). This indicated that TCR activation itself drives IFN- ? expression, independent of either T-bet or IL-12/Stat4. The finding that TCR stimulation and IL-12 both induced less IFN- ? in DKO compared with wild-type CD4 T cells suggests that although the requirement for T-bet may not be absolute, T-bet plays a major regulatory role for IFN- ? production independent of its effects on IL-12R ? 2 or GATA-3. Eomes compensates for T-bet in IFN-? expression in CD4 T cells Since TCR activation induced IFN- ? expression independent of both T-bet and IL-12/Stat4, this suggested another pathway for IFN- ? regulation. Eomes plays a complementary role for T-bet in IFN- ? regulation in CD8 T cells ( 11 – 13 ). We examined if Eomes also plays a role for CD4 IFN- ? regulation. Real-time RT-PCR for Eomes expression was performed on wild-type, T-bet-deficient, and Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4+CD25– T cells after 2 days of stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2 A , there were much higher levels of Eomes expression in stimulated DKO CD4 T cells compared with wild-type or T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells, suggesting that similar to T-bet, Eomes was also inhibited by IL-4/Stat6/GATA-3. Examination of Eomes expression in naive CD4+CD25– and CD8 T cells showed that its expression in CD4 T cells is very limited compared with CD8 T cells, and Stat6 and T-bet double deficiency did not affect expression ( Fig. 2 A ), indicating that higher levels in stimulated CD4 T cells were not due to abnormal basal expression. Expression levels of IFN- ? , Eomes, IL-12R ? 2, and GATA-3 were compared after 24 and 48 h of activation. As shown in Fig. 2 B , TCR and IL-12 induced rapid Eomes and IFN- ? expression by 24 h of activation, significant IL-12R ? 2 expression was observed 48 h after stimulation, and there was no difference in GATA-3 expression between 24 and 48 h in DKO CD4 T cells. This suggested that Eomes, but not IL-12R ? 2 or GATA-3, played a role in the early IFN- ? response. Bicistronic GFP retroviral vectors expressing Eomes or T-bet were used to transduce Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4 T cells to determine whether T-bet or Eomes directly regulated IFN- ? . GFP+ and GFP– cells were purified by flow cytometric sorting. Real-time RT-PCR confirmed that retroviral infection resulted in a >100-fold increase in T-bet or Eomes expression (data not shown). After resting for 2 days, cells were restimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAbs for another 2 days. Intracellular staining showed that both GFP-Eomes+ and GFP-T-bet+ cells had marked IFN- ? production ( Fig. 2 C ). These data indicated that both T-bet and Eomes directly up-regulated IFN- ? expression, and the failure to observe Eomes for CD4 IFN- ? responses in T-bet-deficient cells was likely to due to its repression by elevated IL-4/Stat6/GATA-3 Th2 signals. T-bet-independent IFN-? and Th1 development are very susceptible to suppression by IL-6 and TGF? Th17 development is driven by the combination of IL-6 plus TGF ? signals. We examined if Stat6/T-bet DKO T cells respond differently to Th17 polarizing signals. CD4+CD25– wild-type and DKO cells were cultured in APC-dependent or -independent conditions, with combinations of IL-6, TGF ? , or IL-12. As shown in Fig. 3 A , IFN- ? expression is more susceptible to inhibition by IL-6 and TGF ? in DKO compared with wild-type cells. IL-6 or TGF ? alone completely abolished IFN- ? production, and exogenous IL-12 failed to restore IFN- ? production. IL-6 plus TGF ? also induced much higher levels of IL-17 in DKO than in wild-type cells. IL-12 only partially inhibited IL-17 expression. These data indicated that without T-bet, Th1 differentiation was susceptible to suppression from Th17 polarizing signals, and Th17 development was strongly favored. Since Eomes compensated for T-bet for IFN- ? transcription ( Fig. 2 ), we examined if susceptibility to suppression of IFN- ? production was related to Eomes inhibition. IL-6 and TGF ? both inhibited Eomes expression in both DKO and wild-type cells ( Fig. 3 B ). In CD8 T cells, which express higher levels of Eomes, IL-6 or IL-6 combined with TGF ? inhibited IFN- ? , induced higher levels of IL-17, and inhibited Eomes to a greater degree in DKO compared with wild-type T cells ( Fig. 3, C and D ). Forced Eomes expression in DKO CD4 T cells suppresses IL-17 expression while it prevents IL-6- and TGF ? -mediated IFN- ? inhibition ( Fig. 3 E ). Taken together, these data indicated that both T-bet and Eomes protected Th1 from Th17 polarization, and inhibition of Eomes by Th17 polarizing signals leads to preferential Th17 development in the absence of T-bet. Stat6 and T-bet double deficiencies enable IL-6 to initiate Th17 cell differentiation IL-6 treatment induced IL-17 production in DKO CD4 and CD8 T cells ( Fig. 3, A , B , and D ). Real-time RT-PCR showed that IL-6 induced IL-17A and IL-17F transcripts, as well as ROR ? T ( Fig. 4 A ). IL-17 polarization is dependent on TGF ? ( 25 – 30 ); however, IL-6 alone induced IL-17 expression in APC-independent conditions, and there was no difference in TGF ? expression in wild-type compared with DKO CD4 T cells ( Fig. 4 A ). FoxP3-expressing regulatory CD4 T cells are suggested to be a source for TGF ? in Th17 and regulatory T cell differentiation ( 34 ); however, intracellular staining showed no FoxP3-expressing cells in either wild-type or DKO CD4+CD25– T cells after IL-6 stimulation ( Fig. 4 B ). To further investigate if IL-6 mediated IL-17 expression, neutralizing anti-TGF ? Abs were added to cultures. As shown in Fig. 4 C , 0.05 ? g/ml anti-TGF ? significantly inhibited IL-6-driven IL-17 expression, but there was still low but consistent IL-17 expression even in the presence of the highest concentrations of anti-TGF ? Abs (5 ? g/ml). Real-time RT-PCR also showed that at a dose as low as 0.05 ? g/ml, anti-TGF ? reduced expression of IL-17A and IL-17F, yet the highest concentrations of anti-TGF ? Ab did not fully extinguish IL-17 expression ( Fig. 4 D ). Collectively, these data indicated that CD4 T cells deficient in both Stat6 and T-bet are much more sensitive to IL-6 for Th17 development. IL-23 promotes IL-6-driven Th17 differentiation IL-23 promotes Th17 survival, expansion, and phenotype maintenance ( 12 , 23 , 24 ). IL-23 induced very little IL-17 expression, indicating that Stat6 and T-bet double deficiencies do not autoinitiate Th17 development ( Fig. 5 A ). When combined with IL-6, IL-23 significantly enhanced IL-6-driven IL-17 expression, even in the presence of high concentrations of anti-TGF ? neutralizing Abs. IL-21 negatively regulates IFN- ? expression through Eomes inhibition ( 15 ), and IL-6 alone inhibited Eomes ( Fig. 3, B and D ). We investigated if Eomes inhibition by IL-21 may lead to IL-17 induction. IL-21 did inhibit Eomes expression, but it induced far less IL-17 compared with IL-6 in DKO CD4 T cells ( Fig. 5, B and C ). When IL-21 was combined with IL-23, significant IL-17 expression was observed, further indicating that Eomes inhibition played a role in Th17 differentiation. IL-21 did not potentiate IL-6- or IL-6 plus IL-23-driven IL-17 induction. This suggested that IL-6 and IL-21 may use the same pathways to regulate IL-17, likely through Stat3 induction and Eomes inhibition. IL-6 drives pathogenic Th17 cell generation In addition to IL-17, recent studies demonstrated that IL-6 combined with TGF ? also induces IL-10, and IL-10 in turn restrains the pathologic effects of IL-17 ( 31 , 32 ). To determine whether IL-6-driven Th17 cells also expressed IL-10, cells were stimulated with IL-6, TGF ? , and/or IL-23 ( Fig. 6 A ). Only IL-6 plus TGF ? induced both IL-17 and IL-10, while IL-6 alone or IL-6 plus IL-23 induced only IL-17 without IL-10. In the SCID adoptive transfer colitis model, IL-6-cultured Th17 induced more severe colitis than did IL-6 plus TGF ? -cultured Th17 cells. Immunohistochemistry for CD4 and CD11c showed many more infiltrating cells in colons of mice receiving IL-6-cultured Th17 (not shown), and real-time RT-PCR showed significantly more IL-17 expression ( Fig. 6 B ). Stat6 and T-bet DKO CD4 T cells induce Th17-dominant colitis development To determine whether Th17-dominant responses by DKO CD4 T cells occurred in vivo, wild-type, T-bet-deficient, and Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4+CD25–CD45RBhigh T cells were purified and transferred into SCID mice, and body weight and the development of colitis were monitored. Recipients of wild-type CD4 T cells had weight loss and development of colitis within 8 wk, whereas T-bet deficiency abolished colitis development, as previously reported ( 17 ). Transfer of DKO cells also led to weight loss and colitis. Colitis induced by transfer of wild-type or DKO CD4 T cells was similar in degree ( Fig. 7, A and B ). Immunohistochemistry for CD4 and CD11c showed similar patterns and numbers of CD4 and DC infiltration ( Fig. 7 C ). These results suggested that relieving IL-4/Stat6 Th2 signals in T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells enabled them to be pathologically active. To determine whether colitis induced by Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4 T cells was due to Th1 or Th17 cell generation, lamina propria lymphocytes were purified and IFN- ? and IL-17 expression examined by real-time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 7 D , there were striking differences in IFN- ? and IL-17 expression. Stat6/T-bet DKO colitis T cells expressed little IFN- ? but much more IL-17 than did wild-type colitogenic T cells, indicating that Th17 development also occurred in vivo. There was also no IL-10 expression, suggesting the induction of pathogenic IL-10– Th17. Administration of anti-IL-17 neutralizing mAbs at days 0 and 7 significantly attenuated Stat6/T-bet DKO cell-induced colitis, but not wild-type CD4 T cell-induced colitis ( Fig. 7 E ). Similarly, administration of anti-IL-6 mAbs on days 0, 7, and 14 after adoptive transfer completely prevented colitis ( Fig. 7 F ). Thus, there is an in vivo process permitting the development of IL-6-dependent colitogenic Th17 without IL-10 production.  Stat6 deficiency enables T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells to produce IFN-? CD4+CD25– T cells from wild-type, T-bet KO, and Stat6 and T-bet DKO mice were purified and stimulated with anti-CD3 mAbs in the presence of T cell-depleted splenocytes as accessory cells (APC), plus low concentrations of IL-2, along with IL-12, IFN- ? , or IL-4. After 4 days of culture, intracellular staining was performed to measure IFN- ? and IL-4 expression. In agreement with a previous report ( 10 ), blocking the IL-4/Th2 pathway enabled T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells to respond to IL-12 for IFN- ? induction ( Fig. 1 A ), confirming that IL-12 could induce T-bet independent of IFN- ? expression. Stat6 deficiency did not fully restore the IL-12-driven IFN- ? response, with 15.4% IFN- ? expressing cells in DKO compared with 48.1% in wild-type cells ( Fig. 1 A ). Similar results were observed with an APC-independent culture system in which CD4+CD25– T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 plus soluble anti-CD28 mAbs (data not shown). Dose-response analysis further confirmed that IL-12-induced, T-bet-independent, IFN- ? production was reduced ( Fig. 1 B ). Exogenous IFN- ? -driven IFN- ? production is dependent on T-bet ( Fig. 1 A ). There was very limited IL-4 expression in DKO CD4 T cells ( Fig. 1, A and B ), with or without exogenous IL-4, suggesting that decreased IFN- ? induction by IL-12 was not due to inhibition from IL-4/Th2 signals. Real-time RT-PCR showed that there was no IL-12R ? 2 expression in T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells, while Stat6 deficiency restored IL-12R ? 2 expression, and IL-12R ? 2 expression was comparable in wild-type and DKO cells ( Fig. 1 C ), indicating that reduced IFN- ? induction by IL-12 was not due to differential IL-12R ? 2 transcription. There was very little GATA-3 expressed in Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4 T cells, and it was suppressed by IL-12 to similarly low levels in wild-type CD4 T cells ( Fig. 1 C ), indicating that reduced IFN- ? induction by IL-12 was also not due to increased GATA-3 expression. TCR activation alone in APC-independent cultures that lack IL-12 induced low but significant IFN- ? ( Fig. 1 B ). This indicated that TCR activation itself drives IFN- ? expression, independent of either T-bet or IL-12/Stat4. The finding that TCR stimulation and IL-12 both induced less IFN- ? in DKO compared with wild-type CD4 T cells suggests that although the requirement for T-bet may not be absolute, T-bet plays a major regulatory role for IFN- ? production independent of its effects on IL-12R ? 2 or GATA-3.

Expression levels of IFN- ? , Eomes, IL-12R ? 2, and GATA-3 were compared after 24 and 48 h of activation. As shown in Fig. 2 B , TCR and IL-12 induced rapid Eomes and IFN- ? expression by 24 h of activation, significant IL-12R ? 2 expression was observed 48 h after stimulation, and there was no difference in GATA-3 expression between 24 and 48 h in DKO CD4 T cells.

CD4+CD25– wild-type and DKO cells were cultured in APC-dependent or -independent conditions, with combinations of IL-6, TGF ? , or IL-12. As shown in Fig. 3 A , IFN- ? expression is more susceptible to inhibition by IL-6 and TGF ? in DKO compared with wild-type cells.

Since Eomes compensated for T-bet for IFN- ? transcription ( Fig. 2 ), we examined if susceptibility to suppression of IFN- ? production was related to Eomes inhibition. IL-6 and TGF ? both inhibited Eomes expression in both DKO and wild-type cells ( Fig. 3 B ). In CD8 T cells, which express higher levels of Eomes, IL-6 or IL-6 combined with TGF ? inhibited IFN- ? , induced higher levels of IL-17, and inhibited Eomes to a greater degree in DKO compared with wild-type T cells ( Fig. 3, C and D ). Forced Eomes expression in DKO CD4 T cells suppresses IL-17 expression while it prevents IL-6- and TGF ? -mediated IFN- ? inhibition ( Fig. 3 E ).

Stat6 and T-bet double deficiencies enable IL-6 to initiate Th17 cell differentiation IL-6 treatment induced IL-17 production in DKO CD4 and CD8 T cells ( Fig. 3, A , B , and D ). Real-time RT-PCR showed that IL-6 induced IL-17A and IL-17F transcripts, as well as ROR ? T ( Fig. 4 A ). IL-17 polarization is dependent on TGF ? ( 25 – 30 ); however, IL-6 alone induced IL-17 expression in APC-independent conditions, and there was no difference in TGF ? expression in wild-type compared with DKO CD4 T cells ( Fig. 4 A ). FoxP3-expressing regulatory CD4 T cells are suggested to be a source for TGF ? in Th17 and regulatory T cell differentiation ( 34 ); however, intracellular staining showed no FoxP3-expressing cells in either wild-type or DKO CD4+CD25– T cells after IL-6 stimulation ( Fig. 4 B ). To further investigate if IL-6 mediated IL-17 expression, neutralizing anti-TGF ? Abs were added to cultures. As shown in Fig. 4 C , 0.05 ? g/ml anti-TGF ? significantly inhibited IL-6-driven IL-17 expression, but there was still low but consistent IL-17 expression even in the presence of the highest concentrations of anti-TGF ? Abs (5 ? g/ml). Real-time RT-PCR also showed that at a dose as low as 0.05 ? g/ml, anti-TGF ? reduced expression of IL-17A and IL-17F, yet the highest concentrations of anti-TGF ?

IL-23 promotes IL-6-driven Th17 differentiation IL-23 promotes Th17 survival, expansion, and phenotype maintenance ( 12 , 23 , 24 ). IL-23 induced very little IL-17 expression, indicating that Stat6 and T-bet double deficiencies do not autoinitiate Th17 development ( Fig. 5 A ).

This suggested that IL-6 and IL-21 may use the same pathways to regulate IL-17, likely through Stat3 induction and Eomes inhibition.  IL-23 promotes IL-6-driven Th17 differentiation IL-23 promotes Th17 survival, expansion, and phenotype maintenance ( 12 , 23 , 24 ). IL-23 induced very little IL-17 expression, indicating that Stat6 and T-bet double deficiencies do not autoinitiate Th17 development ( Fig. 5 A ). When combined with IL-6, IL-23 significantly enhanced IL-6-driven IL-17 expression, even in the presence of high concentrations of anti-TGF ? neutralizing Abs. IL-21 negatively regulates IFN- ? expression through Eomes inhibition ( 15 ), and IL-6 alone inhibited Eomes ( Fig. 3, B and D ). We investigated if Eomes inhibition by IL-21 may lead to IL-17 induction. IL-21 did inhibit Eomes expression, but it induced far less IL-17 compared with IL-6 in DKO CD4 T cells ( Fig. 5, B and C ). When IL-21 was combined with IL-23, significant IL-17 expression was observed, further indicating that Eomes inhibition played a role in Th17 differentiation. IL-21 did not potentiate IL-6- or IL-6 plus IL-23-driven IL-17 induction. This suggested that IL-6 and IL-21 may use the same pathways to regulate IL-17, likely through Stat3 induction and Eomes inhibition.  IL-6 drives pathogenic Th17 cell generation In addition to IL-17, recent studies demonstrated that IL-6 combined with TGF ? also induces IL-10, and IL-10 in turn restrains the pathologic effects of IL-17 ( 31 , 32 ). To determine whether IL-6-driven Th17 cells also expressed IL-10, cells were stimulated with IL-6, TGF ? , and/or IL-23 ( Fig. 6 A ). Only IL-6 plus TGF ? induced both IL-17 and IL-10, while IL-6 alone or IL-6 plus IL-23 induced only IL-17 without IL-10. In the SCID adoptive transfer colitis model, IL-6-cultured Th17 induced more severe colitis than did IL-6 plus TGF ? -cultured Th17 cells. Immunohistochemistry for CD4 and CD11c showed many more infiltrating cells in colons of mice receiving IL-6-cultured Th17 (not shown), and real-time RT-PCR showed significantly more IL-17 expression ( Fig. 6 B ).  IL-6 drives pathogenic Th17 cell generation In addition to IL-17, recent studies demonstrated that IL-6 combined with TGF ? also induces IL-10, and IL-10 in turn restrains the pathologic effects of IL-17 ( 31 , 32 ). To determine whether IL-6-driven Th17 cells also expressed IL-10, cells were stimulated with IL-6, TGF ? , and/or IL-23 ( Fig. 6 A ). Only IL-6 plus TGF ? induced both IL-17 and IL-10, while IL-6 alone or IL-6 plus IL-23 induced only IL-17 without IL-10. In the SCID adoptive transfer colitis model, IL-6-cultured Th17 induced more severe colitis than did IL-6 plus TGF ? -cultured Th17 cells. Immunohistochemistry for CD4 and CD11c showed many more infiltrating cells in colons of mice receiving IL-6-cultured Th17 (not shown), and real-time RT-PCR showed significantly more IL-17 expression ( Fig. 6 B ).  Stat6 and T-bet DKO CD4 T cells induce Th17-dominant colitis development To determine whether Th17-dominant responses by DKO CD4 T cells occurred in vivo, wild-type, T-bet-deficient, and Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4+CD25–CD45RBhigh T cells were purified and transferred into SCID mice, and body weight and the development of colitis were monitored. Recipients of wild-type CD4 T cells had weight loss and development of colitis within 8 wk, whereas T-bet deficiency abolished colitis development, as previously reported ( 17 ). Transfer of DKO cells also led to weight loss and colitis. Colitis induced by transfer of wild-type or DKO CD4 T cells was similar in degree ( Fig. 7, A and B ). Immunohistochemistry for CD4 and CD11c showed similar patterns and numbers of CD4 and DC infiltration ( Fig. 7 C ). These results suggested that relieving IL-4/Stat6 Th2 signals in T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells enabled them to be pathologically active. To determine whether colitis induced by Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4 T cells was due to Th1 or Th17 cell generation, lamina propria lymphocytes were purified and IFN- ? and IL-17 expression examined by real-time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 7 D , there were striking differences in IFN- ? and IL-17 expression. Stat6/T-bet DKO colitis T cells expressed little IFN- ? but much more IL-17 than did wild-type colitogenic T cells, indicating that Th17 development also occurred in vivo. There was also no IL-10 expression, suggesting the induction of pathogenic IL-10– Th17. Administration of anti-IL-17 neutralizing mAbs at days 0 and 7 significantly attenuated Stat6/T-bet DKO cell-induced colitis, but not wild-type CD4 T cell-induced colitis ( Fig. 7 E ). Similarly, administration of anti-IL-6 mAbs on days 0, 7, and 14 after adoptive transfer completely prevented colitis ( Fig. 7 F ). Thus, there is an in vivo process permitting the development of IL-6-dependent colitogenic Th17 without IL-10 production.  Stat6 and T-bet DKO CD4 T cells induce Th17-dominant colitis development To determine whether Th17-dominant responses by DKO CD4 T cells occurred in vivo, wild-type, T-bet-deficient, and Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4+CD25–CD45RBhigh T cells were purified and transferred into SCID mice, and body weight and the development of colitis were monitored.

Immunohistochemistry for CD4 and CD11c showed similar patterns and numbers of CD4 and DC infiltration ( Fig. 7 C ). These results suggested that relieving IL-4/Stat6 Th2 signals in T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells enabled them to be pathologically active.

As shown in Fig. 7 D , there were striking differences in IFN- ? and IL-17 expression. Stat6/T-bet DKO colitis T cells expressed little IFN- ? but much more IL-17 than did wild-type colitogenic T cells, indicating that Th17 development also occurred in vivo. There was also no IL-10 expression, suggesting the induction of pathogenic IL-10– Th17. Administration of anti-IL-17 neutralizing mAbs at days 0 and 7 significantly attenuated Stat6/T-bet DKO cell-induced colitis, but not wild-type CD4 T cell-induced colitis ( Fig. 7 E ). Similarly, administration of anti-IL-6 mAbs on days 0, 7, and 14 after adoptive transfer completely prevented colitis ( Fig. 7 F ). Thus, there is an in vivo process permitting the development of IL-6-dependent colitogenic Th17 without IL-10 production.  Discussion Although there are questions of whether T-bet directly regulates IFN- ? and Th1 differentiation ( 10 ), its essential role in Th1 and Th2 developmental paradigms has been well established ( 1 – 3 ). Herein, we provide evidence that T-bet plays both indirect and direct roles in IFN- ? regulation and Th1 development. It prevents the Th2 transcription factor GATA-3 from suppressing IL-12R ? 2 expression to maintain the IL-12/Stat4 signaling pathway for IFN- ? regulation. T-bet also directly regulates IFN- ? production and Th1 development, independent of its effects on GATA-3 or IL-12/Stat4. Without T-bet, both TCR- and IL-12-mediated IFN- ? production are reduced, and retroviral T-bet induces significant IFN- ? expression in Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4 T cells. In addition to IFN- ? /Stat1/T-bet and IL-12/Stat4, we uncovered a significant role for TCR/Eomes as a third pathway to regulate CD4 IFN- ? production and Th1 development. Due to very low levels of expression in naive CD4 T cells, the role of Eomes for IFN- ? production has mostly been examined in CD8 T cells ( 11 – 13 ). High levels of Eomes expression were observed in Stat6/T-bet DKO, but not in T-bet deficient CD4 T cells ( Fig. 2 ), indicating that similar to T-bet, Eomes is also inhibited by IL-4/Stat6/GATA-3 signals. CD8 T cells strongly favor IFN- ? production and Tc1 development ( 35 ), and even T-bet deficiency does not result in comparable IL-4/Stat6/GATA-3 signals in CD8 T cells compared with wild-type CD4 T cells (our unpublished data). Therefore, while the role of Eomes in CD8 T cells can be easily identified, its role in CD4 T cells is masked by the Th2 pathway, especially when T-bet is deficient. By using CD4 T cells deficient in both Stat6 and T-bet, we were able to demonstrate that Eomes also plays an important regulatory role for IFN- ? production and Th1 development in CD4 T cells. Ectopic T-bet expression promotes IFN- ? secretion and decreases IL-17 production ( 33 ), while mice deficient in T-bet have increased numbers of Th17 cells ( 25 , 26 ). Herein, we showed that in the absence of T-bet, IFN- ? expression and Th1 development were very susceptible to suppression by Th17 polarizing signals, and CD4 T cells strongly favored Th17 differentiation, demonstrating a critical role for T-bet in Th1 and Th17 selection. Increased IL-17 production corresponded to decreased IFN- ? production ( Fig. 3 A ), suggesting that T-bet may suppress Th17 development through an IFN- ? -dependent pathway. However, in T-bet-deficient and DKO CD8 T cells, there were high levels of both IFN- ? and IL-17, indicating that T-bet also negatively regulates IL-17 expression through an IFN- ? -independent pathway. Higher levels of ROR ? T expression were observed in DKO CD4 T cells ( Fig. 4 A ), and TCR induces higher levels of ROR ? T expression in T-bet-deficient or DKO than in wild-type CD8 T cells (data not shown), suggesting that T-bet may regulate IL-17 expression through ROR ? T repression. TCR activation alone, or combined with IL-23, did not result in IL-17 expression in DKO T cells; IL-17 was expressed only after Eomes was inhibited ( Figs. 3 – 5 ), indicating that Eomes may also play a role in negatively regulating IL-17 expression and the choice between Th1 and Th17. IL-6 inhibits Eomes expression in both wild-type and Stat6/T-bet DKO T cells, but only induces IL-17 expression in DKO T cells. Thus, IL-6 signals alone are not sufficient to block T-bet and Th1 development. Furthermore, IL-6 promotes IL-4 and Th2 differentiation ( 36 – 38 ), and IL-4/Stat6/GATA-3 signals may also in turn repress Th17 differentiation. TGF ? has been shown to suppress both Th1 and Th2 development by inhibiting T-bet and GATA-3 ( 39 , 40 ). Therefore, TGF ? may provide signals necessary for IL-6 to drive IL-17 differentiation by preventing Th2 development through GATA-3, and by suppressing T-bet. Stat6 plus T-bet deficiency may provide similar signals or have similar effects as TGF ? , and thus lower the threshold for TGF ? and enable IL-6 to initiate Th17 differentiation. IL-6-driven DKO Th17 cells do not express IL-10, in contrast to Th17 cells induced by the combination of IL-6 and TGF ? . IL-6 has long been associated with inflammatory diseases, while TGF ? was shown to have antiinflammatory functions. Our findings suggest that under autoimmune conditions, IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23 may induce pathologic Th17 cell generation, minimizing the requirement of TGF ? and its antiinflammatory effects. The precise etiology of autoimmune colitis is not completely clear. It was previously suggested that chronic intestinal inflammation was driven by IL-12, T-bet, and pathogenic Th1 effector cells ( 17 , 42 , 43 ). Recent studies now demonstrate that Th17 cells play an essential role ( 22 , 41 ). In the present study, we showed that eliminating IL-4/Stat6/GATA3 Th2 signals enabled T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells to regain the ability to induce colitis, indicating that T-bet is not required for its development. Since there is still IFN- ? production and Th1 development in DKO CD4 T cells ( Figs. 1 and 7 D ), our study did not clarify if Th1 cells were required for colitis development. Compared with wild-type cells, DKO cells induced colitis that is Th17 dominant ( Fig. 7 ). Anti-IL-17 mAb treatment abolished DKO CD4 T cells-induced colitis, but it had only limited effects on wild-type CD4 T cell-mediated colitis ( Fig. 7 E ), suggesting that both Th1 and Th17 participate in colitis development. There are more IL-17 expressing cells in T-bet-deficient T cells (Refs. 25 , 26 and data not shown), but they failed to induce colitis ( 17 ), also pointing to the involvement of Th1 in Th17-mediated colitis. IL-10 limits Th17-mediated autoimmune inflammatory responses ( 31 , 32 ) ( Fig. 6 B ). It is possible that Th1 cytokines and cells limit IL-10 expression, permitting Th17 cells to induce autoimmunity disease development.  Discussion Although there are questions of whether T-bet directly regulates IFN- ? and Th1 differentiation ( 10 ), its essential role in Th1 and Th2 developmental paradigms has been well established ( 1 – 3 ). Herein, we provide evidence that T-bet plays both indirect and direct roles in IFN- ? regulation and Th1 development. It prevents the Th2 transcription factor GATA-3 from suppressing IL-12R ? 2 expression to maintain the IL-12/Stat4 signaling pathway for IFN- ? regulation. T-bet also directly regulates IFN- ? production and Th1 development, independent of its effects on GATA-3 or IL-12/Stat4. Without T-bet, both TCR- and IL-12-mediated IFN- ? production are reduced, and retroviral T-bet induces significant IFN- ? expression in Stat6/T-bet DKO CD4 T cells. In addition to IFN- ? /Stat1/T-bet and IL-12/Stat4, we uncovered a significant role for TCR/Eomes as a third pathway to regulate CD4 IFN- ? production and Th1 development. Due to very low levels of expression in naive CD4 T cells, the role of Eomes for IFN- ? production has mostly been examined in CD8 T cells ( 11 – 13 ). High levels of Eomes expression were observed in Stat6/T-bet DKO, but not in T-bet deficient CD4 T cells ( Fig. 2 ), indicating that similar to T-bet, Eomes is also inhibited by IL-4/Stat6/GATA-3 signals. CD8 T cells strongly favor IFN- ? production and Tc1 development ( 35 ), and even T-bet deficiency does not result in comparable IL-4/Stat6/GATA-3 signals in CD8 T cells compared with wild-type CD4 T cells (our unpublished data). Therefore, while the role of Eomes in CD8 T cells can be easily identified, its role in CD4 T cells is masked by the Th2 pathway, especially when T-bet is deficient. By using CD4 T cells deficient in both Stat6 and T-bet, we were able to demonstrate that Eomes also plays an important regulatory role for IFN- ? production and Th1 development in CD4 T cells. Ectopic T-bet expression promotes IFN- ? secretion and decreases IL-17 production ( 33 ), while mice deficient in T-bet have increased numbers of Th17 cells ( 25 , 26 ). Herein, we showed that in the absence of T-bet, IFN- ? expression and Th1 development were very susceptible to suppression by Th17 polarizing signals, and CD4 T cells strongly favored Th17 differentiation, demonstrating a critical role for T-bet in Th1 and Th17 selection. Increased IL-17 production corresponded to decreased IFN- ? production ( Fig. 3 A ), suggesting that T-bet may suppress Th17 development through an IFN- ? -dependent pathway. However, in T-bet-deficient and DKO CD8 T cells, there were high levels of both IFN- ? and IL-17, indicating that T-bet also negatively regulates IL-17 expression through an IFN- ? -independent pathway. Higher levels of ROR ? T expression were observed in DKO CD4 T cells ( Fig. 4 A ), and TCR induces higher levels of ROR ? T expression in T-bet-deficient or DKO than in wild-type CD8 T cells (data not shown), suggesting that T-bet may regulate IL-17 expression through ROR ? T repression. TCR activation alone, or combined with IL-23, did not result in IL-17 expression in DKO T cells; IL-17 was expressed only after Eomes was inhibited ( Figs. 3 – 5 ), indicating that Eomes may also play a role in negatively regulating IL-17 expression and the choice between Th1 and Th17. IL-6 inhibits Eomes expression in both wild-type and Stat6/T-bet DKO T cells, but only induces IL-17 expression in DKO T cells. Thus, IL-6 signals alone are not sufficient to block T-bet and Th1 development. Furthermore, IL-6 promotes IL-4 and Th2 differentiation ( 36 – 38 ), and IL-4/Stat6/GATA-3 signals may also in turn repress Th17 differentiation. TGF ? has been shown to suppress both Th1 and Th2 development by inhibiting T-bet and GATA-3 ( 39 , 40 ). Therefore, TGF ? may provide signals necessary for IL-6 to drive IL-17 differentiation by preventing Th2 development through GATA-3, and by suppressing T-bet. Stat6 plus T-bet deficiency may provide similar signals or have similar effects as TGF ? , and thus lower the threshold for TGF ? and enable IL-6 to initiate Th17 differentiation. IL-6-driven DKO Th17 cells do not express IL-10, in contrast to Th17 cells induced by the combination of IL-6 and TGF ? . IL-6 has long been associated with inflammatory diseases, while TGF ? was shown to have antiinflammatory functions. Our findings suggest that under autoimmune conditions, IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23 may induce pathologic Th17 cell generation, minimizing the requirement of TGF ? and its antiinflammatory effects. The precise etiology of autoimmune colitis is not completely clear. It was previously suggested that chronic intestinal inflammation was driven by IL-12, T-bet, and pathogenic Th1 effector cells ( 17 , 42 , 43 ).

In the present study, we showed that eliminating IL-4/Stat6/GATA3 Th2 signals enabled T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells to regain the ability to induce colitis, indicating that T-bet is not required for its development. Since there is still IFN- ? production and Th1 development in DKO CD4 T cells ( Figs. 1 and 7 D ), our study did not clarify if Th1 cells were required for colitis development. Compared with wild-type cells, DKO cells induced colitis that is Th17 dominant ( Fig. 7 ). Anti-IL-17 mAb treatment abolished DKO CD4 T cells-induced colitis, but it had only limited effects on wild-type CD4 T cell-mediated colitis ( Fig. 7 E ), suggesting that both Th1 and Th17 participate in colitis development. There are more IL-17 expressing cells in T-bet-deficient T cells (Refs. 25 , 26 and data not shown), but they failed to induce colitis ( 17 ), also pointing to the involvement of Th1 in Th17-mediated colitis. IL-10 limits Th17-mediated autoimmune inflammatory responses ( 31 , 32 ) ( Fig. 6 B ). It is possible that Th1 cytokines and cells limit IL-10 expression, permitting Th17 cells to induce autoimmunity disease development.
