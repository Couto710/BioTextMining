Identification of seven new prostate cancer susceptibility loci through a genome-wide association study Prostate cancer (PrCa) is the most frequently diagnosed male cancer in developed countries. To identify common PrCa susceptibility alleles, we have previously conducted a genome-wide association study in which 541, 129 SNPs were genotyped in 1,854 PrCa cases with clinically detected disease and 1,894 controls. We have now evaluated promising associations in a second stage, in which we genotyped 43,671 SNPs in 3,650 PrCa cases and 3,940 controls, and a third stage, involving an additional 16,229 cases and 14,821 controls from 21 studies. In addition to previously identified loci, we identified a further seven new prostate cancer susceptibility loci on chromosomes 2, 4, 8, 11, and 22 ( P =1.6×10?8 to P =2.7×10?33).  Methods Samples PrCa cases and controls used in stage 1 of the GWAS have been described previously 1 . PrCa cases and controls for stage 2 ( Figure 1 ) were selected from studies in the UK and Australia. UK cases were drawn from the UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study (UKGPCS). UKGPCS includes cases PrCa cases that were either diagnosed at age ?60 years (n=341) and/or those that had a first or second degree family history of prostate cancer (n=220), recruited from urologists throughout the UK, and a series of cases recruited from PrCa clinics in the Urology Unit at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust over a 14 year period. UK controls were identified through two sources. Six hundred and fifty-six controls were drawn from the UKGPCS study (Prostate Cancer Research Foundation Study component) and were geographically, ethnically and age matched to the UKGPCS young onset cases. They had no family or personal history of PrCa. The remaining controls (n=1636) were selected from men in the ProtecT (Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment) study 27 . ProtecT is a national study of community-based PSA testing and a randomised trial of subsequent PrCa treatment. Approximately 110,000 men between the ages of 50 and 69 years, (with a small set of men aged 45–49 years from one centre), were ascertained through general practices in nine regions in the UK. For this study we selected as controls men who had a PSA of <10ng/ml and negative prostate biopsies. Men with PSA ?3ng/ml were excluded if they had a positive prostatic biopsy. We excluded, from both cases and controls, men who reported to be non-white. The majority of men in the UK are diagnosed via a clinical presentation; amongst the cases in this study 100% of those from the ProtecT study were diagnosed through asymptomatic PSA screening. The Australian cases were ascertained from three studies 28 – 30 : (i) a population-based series of PrCa cases identified from the Victorian Cancer Registry since 1999, diagnosed at <56 years (Early Onset Prostate Cancer Study, EOPCFS; n=631); (ii) a population-based case-control study consisting of cases diagnosed in Melbourne and Perth (Risk Factors for Prostate Cancer Study, RFPCS; n=702). Cases were identified from the population cancer registries, with histopathologically confirmed PrCa, excluding tumors with Gleason scores of < 5, and diagnosed at < 70 years with sampling stratified by age at diagnosis and (iii) a prospective cohort study of 17,154 men aged 40 to 69 years at recruitment in 1990–4 (Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, MCCS; n=378). Controls were selected from the RFPCS study, in which they were identified through government electoral rolls and frequency matched to the age distribution of the RFPCS cases (n=667), together with a random sample from the MCCS cohort (n=981). Stage 3 included samples from 21 PrCa case-control studies from groups in the PRACTICAL Consortium ( Supplementary Table 4 ). All studies were approved by the appropriate ethics committees. Genotyping Stage 2 genotypes were generated using an Illumina iSELECT array. SNPs were selected on the basis of the stage 1 results to include those with (a) a 1df P -trend <.059 (n= 34,484) and (b) a 2df genotype test P <.01 (n=2,202). We also included (c) all SNPs from the 1M array in LD blocks defined around “hits” from stage 1, defined as a SNP with P -trend <.0001; (d) all SNPs from the Illumina 1M array on 8q24; (e) all SNPs from the 550k array in the HLA region and (f) all SNPs significant in the CGEMS GWAS with P -trend <.01. We also included a further set of SNPs of interest in collaboration with CGEMS group (these were not considered in this paper; results to be reported separately). For analysis, we utilized samples on which genotypes could be called for at least 97% of SNPs at a confidence score of ?0.25. Data were generated on 43,671 of 47,120 SNPs. To identify close relatives we computed identity-by-state (IBS) probabilities for all pairs. We identified 93 cryptic duplicate samples (or monozygotic twins) or probable brothers (IBS >0.86). In each case we excluded the individual with the lower call rate. By computing IBS scores between participants and individuals in HapMap and using multi-dimensional scaling, we identified 252 individuals who appeared to have significant Asian or African ancestry (approximately >10% non-European ancestry). We removed 14 cases with a significant level of heterozygosity on X (16–39%; including 3 known cases of Klinefelter’s syndrome). After these exclusions, 3,650 cases and 3,940 controls were used in the final analysis of stage 2. We filtered out all SNPs with a call rate <95%, a minor allele frequency in controls of <1%, or whose genotype frequency in controls departed from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at p<.00001. After these exclusions, we analyzed 43,671 SNPs, of which 42,186 were genotyped in both stage 1 and stage 2. Duplicate concordance was 99.998%. In stage 3, genotyping of samples from all but one study site was performed by 5? exonuclease assay (Taqman™) using the ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers and probes were supplied directly by Applied Biosystems as Assays-By-Design™. The Queensland site used the iPlex Sequenom MassArray® system. Ten of the 12 SNPs worked well with the initial assay; one (rs12155172) had to be redesigned and one (rs4782780) had to be replaced by a proxy SNP (rs11861609, r2=0.93) for all groups except Queensland. These latter two SNPs were therefore only run by 8 groups ( Supplementary Table 4 ). Assays at all sites included at least two negative controls and 2–5% duplicates per plate. Quality control guidelines were followed by all the participating groups as previously described 31 . We excluded individuals that were not typed for at least 80% of the SNPs attempted. Data on a given SNP for a given site were also excluded if they failed QC criteria, which necessitated: a call rate >95%, no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls at P <.00001 and a <2% discordance between genotypes in duplicate samples. Cluster plots were re-examined centrally where necessary. Overall, 12 site/SNP combinations were excluded. Statistical methods We assessed associations between each SNP and PrCa at stage 2 using a 1df Cochran-Armitage trend test and a general 2df chi-squared test. Inflation in the chi-squared statistic was assessed using the genomic control approach; we derived an inflation factor (?) by dividing the median of the lowest 90% of the 1df statistics by the 45% percentile of a 1df chi-squared distribution (0.357). This cutoff was used to avoid inclusion of SNPs likely to be associated with risk. Analyses were stratified by country and, within Australia, by study (MCCS and EOPCS/RFPCS). This stratification was made because the MCCS were known to be oversampled for individuals of Southern Europe ancestry, and because this stratification materially reduced the overdispersion. To further assess population structure, we performed principal components analysis using 15,363 uncorrelated SNPs (r2<0.1). The first component was strongly related to stratum (MCCS vs. EOPCS/RFPCS vs. UK; Supplementary Figure 2 ). Addition of up to five principal components as covariates made no difference to the inflation, after adjustment for stratum, and we therefore chose not to use the principal components in the primary analysis, to preserve consistency with stage 3. However, subsequent adjustment for the SNPs reaching genome-wide significance made no material difference to the strength of the associations or significance levels. SNPs were selected for evaluation in stage 3 on the basis of a significance level of P <10?6 based on a 1df trend test. Multiple logistic regression was used to define the minimal set of SNPs that showed evidence of association at P <.05, after adjustment for other SNPs. In stage 3, we stratified analyses by study and racial/ethnic group (white, African-American, south-east Asian, Latino and Hawaiian). Where <100 individuals were recorded in a minority ethnic group, these individuals were excluded. The Mayo Clinic study genotyped multiple cases for the same family; we included only one case per family at random in the analysis. After exclusions, analyses were based on 16,229 PrCa cases and 14,821 controls from stage 3. ORs and confidence limits were estimated using unconditional logistic regression, stratified by study and racial/ethnic group. In the text we have reported the combined tests of association over all three stages, but have emphasized the OR estimates from stage 3, to minimize the effect of “winner’s curse”. Tests of homogeneity of the ORs across strata were assessed using likelihood ratio tests. The associations between genotype and family history and Gleason score were assessed using a case-only analysis; Gleason score was analysed both using the binary endpoint of Gleason score ? 7 and as an ordinal variable, by polytomous regression. Modification of the ORs by age was assessed using a case-only analysis, assessing the association between age and SNP genotype in the cases using polytomous regression. The associations between SNP genotypes and PSA level were assessed using linear regression, after log-transformation of PSA level to correct for skewness. Analyses were performed in R (principally using SNPMatrix 32 ) and Stata.  Samples PrCa cases and controls used in stage 1 of the GWAS have been described previously 1 . PrCa cases and controls for stage 2 ( Figure 1 ) were selected from studies in the UK and Australia. UK cases were drawn from the UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study (UKGPCS). UKGPCS includes cases PrCa cases that were either diagnosed at age ?60 years (n=341) and/or those that had a first or second degree family history of prostate cancer (n=220), recruited from urologists throughout the UK, and a series of cases recruited from PrCa clinics in the Urology Unit at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust over a 14 year period. UK controls were identified through two sources.

ProtecT is a national study of community-based PSA testing and a randomised trial of subsequent PrCa treatment. Approximately 110,000 men between the ages of 50 and 69 years, (with a small set of men aged 45–49 years from one centre), were ascertained through general practices in nine regions in the UK.
