LX211 (Voclosporin) Suppresses Experimental Uveitis and Inhibits Human T Cells Purpose To test the therapeutic effectiveness of voclosporin against experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) in rats and to evaluate its effect on human T cells. Methods EAU was induced by immunization with a uveitogenic protein. Voclosporin administration, by subcutaneous injection, began on day (d) 0 or d7 after immunization. Treatment effectiveness was evaluated in vivo using clinical EAU scoring (d7–d13) and histopathologic evaluation of enucleated eyes after experimental termination. Rodent lymphocytes were harvested from lymph nodes on d14 for antigen-specific proliferation assays. The effect of voclosporin on human T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion was examined in vitro. Results Voclosporin prevented EAU development in rats receiving medium and high preventive doses, whereas high-dose voclosporin administration effectively treated EAU. Lymphocytes from animals treated with voclosporin had decreased antigen-specific proliferation in vitro compared with lymphocytes from untreated animals. No evidence of abnormal ocular histopathology was found in the eyes from animals that received high doses of therapeutic voclosporin. Using human T cells, voclosporin inhibited human T-cell proliferation up to 100-fold. Furthermore, voclosporin treatment of human T cells significantly reduced pan T-cell effector responses. Conclusions Voclosporin effectively suppressed uveoretinitis in an animal model that imitates the human inflammatory ocular disease by inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation. In addition, voclosporin effectively inhibited human T-cell proliferation and function in vitro. The authors report the first evidence supporting the application of voclosporin to treat intraocular inflammation.  Methods EAU was induced by immunization with a uveitogenic protein.

The authors report the first evidence supporting the application of voclosporin to treat intraocular inflammation.  Methods Induction of Uveoretinitis Male Lewis rats (6–8 weeks old) from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) were immunized with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), prepared as described. 29 IRBP was emulsified 1:1 with complete Freund adjuvant (CFA; Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 2.5 mg/mL Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37RA (Difco Laboratories, Lawrence, KS). Emulsion (100 ? L) was injected into the base of the tail. Pertussis toxin (Sigma Chemical), which was obtained after isolation and purification as previously described, 30 was injected intraperitoneally. All animal experiments were performed under the protocols approved by the National Eye Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Rats were treated according to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Therapeutic Agents and Treatment Schedule CsA was solubilized in olive oil at 25 mg/mL. Voclosporin (labeled ISATX247), in powder form, was dissolved in miglyol 812 oil at three different concentrations (1.56, 6.25, and 25 mg/mL). Samples of each concentration were sent to Isotechnika (Edmonton, AB, Canada) to be analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Dose analyses were performed at three intervals during the study to ensure stability of administered doses. Therapeutic agents were voclosporin (administered in low [2.5 mg/kg], medium [10 mg/kg], and high [40 mg/kg] doses), CsA (positive control, 40 mg/kg), and vehicle (negative control, miglyol 812 oil). Rats were divided into two main treatment groups, preventive and therapeutic. Preventively treated rats received daily subcutaneous injections of CsA or voclosporin in the dorsal back area from day (d) 0 to d13. Treatments in the therapeutic group were delivered daily in the same manner, but treatments began on d7 with respect to IRBP immunization. Each treatment group consisted of three to five rats. Experiments were performed twice; eight rats were used for each treatment. Clinical Scoring To analyze treatment effectiveness against uveitis, daily clinical scores were assigned to each rat starting on d7. Each eye was graded, without masking, according to a previously described scoring system: 0, normal; 0.5, dilated blood vessels in the iris; 1, abnormal pupil contraction; 2, hazy anterior chamber; 3, moderately opaque anterior chamber with dull red reflex; 4, opaque anterior chamber, absent red reflex, and proptosis. 31 There was no masking during this portion of the experiment because clinical scoring was recorded during the administration of therapy. Lymphocyte Proliferation Assay and In Vitro Suppression Draining lymph nodes were harvested after experimental termination, and lymphocytes were prepared by pushing lymph nodes through 40- ? M disposable strainers. Cells were washed twice in RPMI 1640 medium and resuspended in assay medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1 ? M ? -mercaptoethanol, 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 50 ? g/mL gentamicin, 0.25 ? g/mL amphotericin B, 20 mg/mL ?-methyl mannopyranoside, and 1% normal rat serum). Triplicate cultures (2 × 105 cells/well) were stimulated with IRBP (5 ? g/mL) in 96-well plates. To monitor the effects on cell proliferation, cultures were incubated for 7 days and were pulsed with 1 ? Ci [3H] thymidine for the last 16 hours. Histopathology Eyes from euthanatized rats were enucleated and immersed for 1 hour in 4% glutaraldehyde at room temperature and then transferred into 10% formaldehyde until processed. Fixed tissues were dehydrated, embedded in methacrylate, sectioned (4–6 ? m) through the papillary-optic nerve plane, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Severity of EAU was scored in a masked fashion by an ophthalmic pathologist according to a previously described semiquantitative scale. 32 No information about the experimental design or treatments was provided to the pathologist. Human PBMCs and T-Cell Proliferation Assays Normal donor human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated (Ficoll-Paque Plus; GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). T cells were purified by negative selection, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pan T-Cell Isolation Kit II human: Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). T cells or PBMCs were stimulated for 30 minutes with 2 ? g/mL anti-human CD3 and anti-human CD28 (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA), followed by cross-linking with 8 ? g/mL mouse anti-human IgG (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 3 to5 days in the presence of CsA (10 – 100 nM) or voclosporin (0.1–100 nM) and were pulsed with 1 ? Ci [3H] thymidine for the last 16 hours. Supernatants in duplicate cultures were collected at d2 and submitted to ThermoFisher Scientific (Woburn, MA) for Pierce (Rockford, IL) SearchLight cytokine testing services.

Results EAU Model: Clinical Scoring Daily subcutaneous voclosporin injections prevented grossly visible clinical signs of EAU development in comparison with vehicle treatment ( Figs. 1A, 1D–1I ). Doses of voclosporin from the preventive group were effective at preventing clinically significant uveitis (score >2), though the medium and high doses provided more statistically significant protection than the low dose ( Figs. 1D–1F ). More important, we observed dose-dependent effectiveness of voclosporin in animals that received subcutaneous injections after disease onset (d7 – d13; Figs. 1G–1I ). Notably, the highest dose in the therapeutic arm reversed clinical signs of ocular inflammation ( Fig. 1I ). EAU Model: Histopathology Masked evaluation of histopathology after experimental termination of in vivo experiments also revealed dose-dependent efficacy of voclosporin (Figs. 2 , 3 ). Extensive ocular inflammation and photoreceptor destruction was observed in eyes of the vehicle-treated rats ( Fig. 3A ), which had the highest combined anterior and posterior histopathologic scores ( Fig. 2 ). Retinas from vehicle-treated rats had marked inflammatory infiltration, focal destruction of the nuclear layers that were more prominent in the outer nuclear layer, and total loss of inner and outer photoreceptor segments ( Fig. 3A ). Compared with vehicle-treated controls, increasingly significant reductions in median EAU scores were found in eyes from the low, medium, and high voclosporin preventively treated rats ( Fig. 2 ). Evidence of uveitis (0.25–3.0) was found in 8 of 16 eyes from the low-dose voclosporin preventive treatment group. Mild histopathology (0.5) was found in 4 of 16 rat eyes from the medium voclosporin preventive treatment group ( Fig. 2 ). No visible histopathologic abnormality was reported in any of the 16 eyes taken from rats in the high-dose voclosporin preventive treatment group ( Fig. 2 ). All animals in the low-dose voclosporin therapeutic treatment group exhibited uveitis (1.5–5.0), including retinal folds and small granuloma formation ( Fig. 3C, white arrows ). Mild uveitis (0.25–3.0) was found in 12 of 16 rat eyes from the medium-dose voclosporin therapeutic treatment group ( Fig. 2 ), including inflammatory cellular infiltration surrounding the retinal vessels and in the vitreous ( Fig. 3D, black arrows ). No abnormality was present in any of the 16 eyes taken from rats in the high-dose voclosporin treatment group (Figs. 2 , 3E ). Voclosporin Suppression of Lymphocyte Proliferation Along with suppression of intraocular inflammation (Figs. 2 , 3 ), in vitro proliferation of lymphocytes taken from rats treated with voclosporin was significantly suppressed in cultures stimulated with IRBP ( Fig. 4 ). In addition, when analyzing the effect of voclosporin on human lymphocyte proliferation in vitro, dose-dependent inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation was found in cells from nine healthy donors. A representative graph from three independent experiments is shown in Figure 5 . A dose-dependent reduction of CD3/CD28-stimulated T-cell proliferation was observed ( Fig. 5 ). Voclosporin Suppression of Human T Cell Cytokine Secretion Compared with cytokine secretion from vehicle-treated cells, CD3/CD28-stimulated human T cells, incubated with various levels of voclosporin, had decreased Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokine release proportional to the voclosporin dosage. Specifically, Th1 cytokine levels for IFN- ? (vehicle, 2084 ± 701 pg/mL; 100 nM voclosporin, 22 ± 13 pg/mL) and TNF- ? (vehicle, 787 ± 127 pg/mL; 100 nM voclosporin, 20 ± 8 pg/mL) were reduced up to 300-fold and 58-fold, respectively ( Fig. 6A ). Th2 cytokine levels for IL-4 (vehicle, 49 ± 6 pg/mL; 100 nM voclosporin, 0.9 ± 0.3 pg/mL), IL-5 (vehicle, 154 ± 23 pg/mL; 100 nM voclosporin, 18.9 ± 0.7 pg/mL), IL-10 (vehicle, 1048 ± 83 pg/mL; 100 nM voclosporin, 8.6 ± 5.6 pg/mL), and IL-13 (vehicle, 312 ± 24 pg/mL; 100 nM voclosporin, 50.8 ± 23 pg/mL) were reduced up to 37-fold, 7-fold, 322-fold, and 10-fold, respectively ( Fig. 6B ). Th17 (IL-17) levels (vehicle, 1077 ± 158 pg/mL; 100 nM voclosporin, 72.6 ± 12.2 pg/mL) were reduced up to 20.5-fold, whereas IL-23 levels were completely inhibited (vehicle, 14 ± 14 pg/mL; 100 nM voclosporin, 0 ± 0 pg/mL; Fig. 6C ).

Discussion CNIs have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of refractory uveitis. CsA and FK-506 (tacrolimus) have been effective in preventing the development of uveitis in the EAU rodent model. 26 , 28 Voclosporin (LX-211) is a novel immunosuppressive agent that also acts through calcineurin inhibition. Its efficacy for other autoimmune diseases has been demonstrated in previous animal studies. With the use of a collagen-induced animal model for arthritis, Maksymowych et al. 33 demonstrated that ISATX247 (voclosporin) significantly decreased the development of joint erosions in treated animals compared with controls. Voclosporin has also demonstrated prolonged renal allograft survival in non-human primates 20 and has demonstrated efficacy in clinical studies for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. 23 To our knowledge, the efficacy of voclosporin has not been previously evaluated for ocular inflammatory diseases. In this article, we have reported the efficacy of voclosporin in the prevention and treatment of ocular inflammation in a rat model of EAU. Voclosporin was effective in preventing the development of severe, clinical EAU with doses as low as 2.5 mg/kg when administered daily from the day of immunization with IRBP. In the therapeutic group of voclosporin (animals receiving voclosporin injections d7 – d13 after immunization with IRBP), a notable decrease in clinical and histologic evidence of intraocular inflammation in animals treated with the 10-mg/kg dose was observed compared with untreated control animals. The amelioration of intraocular inflammation, supported by histopathologic evidence of this effect, suggests that voclosporin may be a useful therapy for ocular inflammatory conditions. CSA was used as the positive control because of its proven efficacy in preventing EAU formation and treating established EAU in the rodent model. 28 The dosage of CsA used in this study, 40 mg/kg, was based on the results from the earlier study, which demonstrated this dose was able to inhibit clinical manifestations of uveitis and to decrease clinical signs of uveitis when administered 7 days after immunization with IRBP. As in earlier studies, CsA was successful in the prevention and treatment of uveitis in all rats treated with CsA in this study. Based on the clinical and histopathologic findings in this study, the therapeutic efficacy of voclosporin appears to compare favorably with cyclosporine. The in vitro effects of voclosporin on lymphocytes, from rodents and humans, suggest that its efficacy may be mediated through the inhibition of T-cell effector responses. Lymphocytes harvested from animals treated with voclosporin demonstrated significant decreases in antigen proliferation assays compared with untreated control animals. This finding was observed with the subcutaneous administration of 2.5 mg/kg/d dosing and with higher doses of medication. Interestingly, voclosporin also demonstrated a dose-dependent ability to inhibit the proliferation of stimulated human T lymphocytes. Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines were also decreased in human T-cell cultures treated with voclosporin, suggesting that voclosporin inhibits pan T-cell effector responses. Pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 immune responses have previously been shown to be salient features of uveitis and scleritis. 34 - 37 The ability of voclosporin to downregulate proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 effector responses, combined with its efficacy in the prevention and treatment of EAU, supports further investigation of this novel CNI for the treatment of ocular inflammatory disease.

Figures Figure 1 High-dose (40 mg/kg) subcutaneous voclosporin treatment of rats, starting at the earliest clinical sign of uveitis (d7 after induction), reversed clinical signs of ocular disease. Rats were immunized with IRBP (d0) to induce uveitis and were injected subcutaneously (d0–d13 [preventive] or d7–d13 [therapeutic]) with CsA (40 mg/kg) or voclosporin (low dose, 2.5 mg/kg; medium dose, 10 mg/kg; high dose, 40 mg/kg). At the time of injection, mean clinical scores were recorded (d7–d13) and are represented as mean clinical scores ± SEM ( n = 16 eyes; two independent experiments). The values recorded on a given day for each treatment group were compared with the values recorded for other treatment groups ( A - I ). Specifically, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was performed (Friedman test, P < 0.05), followed by Dunn multiple comparison test to determine differences among groups. Statistical significance compared with vehicle is indicated by asterisks (* P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001). Figure 2 No visible signs of histopathology were found in rats that received daily subcutaneous 40 mg/kg voclosporin treatments, starting at the earliest sign of clinical disease (d7).

At the termination of the experiment on d14 after immunization, triplicate cultures of lymphocytes (2 × 105 cells/well) were stimulated with IRBP (5 ? g/mL) in 96-well plates.
