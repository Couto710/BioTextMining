Lin28 Enhances Tumorigenesis and is Associated With Advanced Human Malignancies Multiple members of the let-7 family of miRNAs are often repressed in human cancers 1 , 2 , thereby promoting oncogenesis by de-repressing the targets K-Ras, c-Myc, and HMGA2 3 , 4 . However, the mechanism by which let-7 miRNAs are coordinately repressed is unclear. The RNA-binding proteins Lin28 and Lin28B block let-7 precursors from being processed to mature miRNAs 5 – 8 , suggesting that over-expression of Lin28/Lin28B might promote malignancy via repression of let-7. Here we show that LIN28 and LIN28B are over-expressed in primary human tumors and human cancer cell lines (overall frequency ?15%), and that over-expression is linked to repression of let-7 family miRNAs and de-repression of let-7 targets. Lin28/Lin28B facilitate cellular transformation in vitro , and over-expression is associated with advanced disease across multiple tumor types. Our work provides a mechanism for the coordinate repression of let-7 miRNAs observed in a subset of human cancers, and associates activation of LIN28/LIN28B with poor clinical prognosis.  Methods Cell Culture Cell lines were originally obtained from ATCC and cultured under standard conditions. BaF3/AblG2A and Baf3/SrcY530F lines have been described elsewhere 54 . LKR cells were derived from a mouse adenocarcinoma 55 and were a kind gift of Carla Kim. Antibodies The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: c-myc (Santa Cruz, sc-764), KRas (Santa Cruz, sc-30), Abl-K12 (Santa Cruz, sc-131), c-Src (Cell Signaling, #2110). Anti-Lin28 (Proteintech group) was used for immunohistochemistry. Cloning and Plasmid Construction Mammalian Lin28 and LIN28B cDNA were subcloned into pBabe.Puro and pMSCV.Neo retroviral vectors. pMSCV.Neo.let-7g construct was previously described 3 . LIN28B shRNA in lentiviral plasmid was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (TRCN0000122599). Control shRNA was commercially purchased (SHC002V, Sigma-Aldrich) Immunohistochemistry Sections of tissues were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with graded series of ethanol (absolute, 95%, 80% and 50%, respectively, and distilled water), followed by two washes of 5 min each in PBS-T. Antigen retrieval was performed for 20 min in sodium citrate buffer (10mM pH 6) at 90–100°C followed by wash with PBST 1× 5 min. Tissue sections were then incubated for 10 min in 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in methanol to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were then washed for 5 min in PBS-T and blocked at room temperature for 1 h by using 2% normal goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% triton-X in PBS. Tissue sections were then incubated in humidified chamber for overnight incubation at 4°C with primary antibody (1/200 in TBST). Sections were subsequently washed with PBS-T (3× 5min) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with secondary antibody (goat anti rabbit). After a wash with PBS-T (3× 5min), sections were incubated with ready to use streptavidin peroxidase (Lab Vision, Fremont, CA) for 10 min at room temperature and then color was developed by using a DAB kit (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Viral Production For ecotropic viral production, retroviral plasmid DNA and pCL-Eco were transfected into 293T cells in a 1:1 mass ratio and virus harvested after 48h. For VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus, viral plasmid, lentiviral gag/pol, and VSV-G were transfected in a mass ratio 1:0.9:0.1, and virus was harvested after 72 hrs. 1 mL of unconcentrated viral supernatant was used to infect 50,000 cells. Infected cells were selected on antibiotic prior to subsequent analysis. Bisulfite Sequencing Bisulfite sequencing was performed as described 56 with the commercially available EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research). Primers were designed using MethPrimer to target a region 1 kb downstream of the LIN28B transcriptional start site. Transformation and Growth Assays Soft agar assays were performed essentially as described previously with 50,000 cells seeded per well 57 . Colonies were stained with 0.005% crystal violet and counted after 3–4 weeks of growth. Quantitative RT-PCR quantitative RT-PCR was used for detection of mature miRNA species as described previously 8 . mRNA expression analysis was performed by quantitative PCR using SYBR green dye with fold-changes calculated by the ??Ct method or using LIN28B Taqman probe on patient samples. Microarray Data Analysis The following are Gene expression Omnibus accession numbers for publically available microarray datasets analyzed for LIN28 and LIN28B expression in this paper: GSE11024, GSE6222, GSE9843, GSE9891, GSE4170. Log2 transformed expression data were normalized to the average expression signal for normal tissue (where available), or row-normalized for the GSE9843 and GSE9891 datasets. Cutoff for over-expression was taken as a normalized expression value of 2 or greater unless stated otherwise. For microarray profiling of cancer cell lines, the samples run were from the Sanger Cell line collection as described at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/CellLines/ using an HT-HG_U133A chip, miRNAs were profiled using our previously described platform 58 . The HCC samples were stratified into LIN28B-high and -low groups based on a cut-off of 200U. LIN28B amplification status was determined in a panel of 1,103 cancer DNA samples – consisting of breast cancer (n = 242), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 6), lung non-small cell cancer (n=734), and hepatocellular carcinoma (n=121) – hybridized to the Affymetrix 250K StyI SNP Array (Beroukhim et al, Manuscript in preparation). Copy number estimates for LIN28B were normalized using a panel of population-matched controls and segmented using the Gain and Loss of DNA (GLAD) algorithm 59 . Human tissue samples The expression levels of let-7 species and LIN28B were assessed in 89 HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples including 77 clinically early HCC (25 pathologically early and 52 pathologically advanced cases) and 12 very advanced cases. All the samples were obtained from patients undergoing liver resection in the three hospitals of the HCC Genomic Consortium: Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NY (US), Hospital Clinic, Barcelona (Spain) and Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan (Italy). We obtained approval from the Institutional Review Board and patients were properly consented. Quantitative PCR detection of <italic>LIN28</italic> and <italic>LIN28B</italic> on CML samples Total RNA was isolated from cell lines and patient samples (a mixture of both peripheral blood and bone marrow) using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was generated from 1mg of total RNA using Cloned AMV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNA synthesis was performed under the following thermocycler conditions: 25°C for 10 minutes, 42°C for 60 minutes, 99°C for 5 minutes and 4°C hold. Gene specific primers and probes were designed using Primer Express Version 3 (ABI; Foster City, CA). All of the QPCR primers and florescent probes were manufactured by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) was performed on 100ng of synthesized cDNA in a 50ml reaction using the ABI 7900HT Real-Time PCR System under the following conditions: stage 1, 95°C for 10 minutes: and stage 2, 95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 1 minute for a total of 40 cycles. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) FISH was performed using standard protocols on metaphase nuclei as previously described. 1 The RP-770C15 and RP-809N15 BAC probes were obtained from the RPCI-11 human BAC library and directly labelled with SpectrumGreen and SpectrumRed, respectively, via a nick translation kit (Vysis), hybridized in a humidified chamber overnight at 37°C, and counterstained with DAPI. Detection was performed using a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence microscope equipped with a COHU-CCD camera and Quips software.
