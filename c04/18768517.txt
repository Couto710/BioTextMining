Associations of lifestyle and physiological factors with prostate-specific antigen concentrations: evidence from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2001-2004) Studies suggest inverse associations between obesity and PSA. However, there is little evidence whether factors related to obesity including lifestyle (diet and physical activity) and physiological factors (insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome), influence PSA. We used dietary, physical activity and serum PSA, insulin, glucose, and lipid data for men 40+ years, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2001-2004; n=2,548). Energy, fat and carbohydrate intakes were estimated from a 24-hour dietary recall. Men were considered as having metabolic syndrome based on the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Leisure-time physical activity and doctor-diagnosed hypertension were self-reported. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from measured weight and height. We computed geometric mean PSA (ng/ml), adjusted for age, race and BMI, by tertile of energy, fat and carbohydrate intake, and level of physical activity, and among men with and without insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, in the whole population, and by race. The geometric mean PSA (95%CI) among men in the lowest tertile of energy was 1.05 (0.97-1.1), relative to 0.85(0.8-0.9) in the highest tertile (p=0.0002) in the whole population. PSA concentrations were lower among overweight men with higher versus lower energy intake (p=0.001). PSA concentrations in men with insulin resistance was lower (0.87(0.8-0.9)), relative to men without insulin resistance (0.98(0.9-1.1)), p=0.04. All associations were in similar directions within racial subgroups. No associations were observed between the other lifestyle and physiological factors. Additional studies are required to confirm these results and to investigate the potential mechanisms that may explain these relationships.  INTRODUCTION Screening for prostate cancer using serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentrations has been commonplace in the US. Previous evidence suggests that obesity, which has reached epidemic proportions in the US ( 1 ), may be inversely associated with PSA ( 2 - 7 ), likely due to lower testosterone concentrations which influence PSA production ( 8 - 10 ), and/or hemodilution of PSA among obese men ( 11 ). However, there is little evidence whether lifestyle and physiologic factors related to obesity, including energy, fat and carbohydrate intake, physical activity, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, influence PSA concentrations. One previous large clinical trial (N=3,341) evaluated energy, fat and carbohydrate intake in relation with PSA concentrations and found no associations ( 12 ). Another study that examined physical activity in relation to PSA reported null findings ( 13 ). To our knowledge, the associations of PSA with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome have not been examined previously. Although, a study, using national data, has reported inverse associations between diabetes and PSA ( 14 ), it must be noted that not all diabetics are insulin resistant or have metabolic syndrome. Since the relationships of PSA, obesity, physical activity, diet, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome are complex and not well-defined, there is a need to understand these further. Investigating this area may aid in more accurate interpretation of PSA, and have potential implications on prostate cancer screening and detection in the population. Therefore, using a large national database, we extend the previous obesity-PSA hypothesis, to evaluate whether PSA varies with the above physiologic and lifestyle factors associated with obesity, among healthy American men. Figure 1 presents our hypothetical framework for asking these questions.  Participant characteristics Nearly 80% of the study population was non-Hispanic white, with a median age of 52 years ( Table 1 ). Three fourths of the population was either obese or overweight (BMI>25), with the median BMI being 28. At least, half of the participants had PSA concentrations of 0.9 ng/ml, consumed approximately 2,130 kilocalories/day, and reported being either moderately or intensely active. Further, in the subpopulation in whom we were able to evaluate metabolic syndrome, 41% of the participants had metabolic syndrome, and about half the population had insulin resistance.  Associations between PSA and lifestyle factors Higher energy intake was inversely associated with PSA concentrations after adjustment for age, race and BMI (p=0.0002). Tertile of dietary fat and carbohydrate intake (measured as percent energy), and level of physical activity, either when evaluated in three categories (sedentary, moderate and intense; data not shown) or in two categories (sedentary versus moderately to intensely active) were not associated with PSA ( Table 2 ). When all the analyses were repeated in racial subgroups, there was no change in the direction of the associations within each group (data not shown). Additional adjustment for survey year (NHANES 2001-2002 or NHANES 2003-2004) did not change these associations. Although the interactions between BMI and the lifestyle factors were not significant, since BMI is related with lifestyle, we explored the joint exposure of BMI and the three lifestyle factors, to better understand these associations with PSA. We observed that for men with BMI 25-30, higher versus lower energy intake was associated with significantly lower PSA concentrations (p=0.001). The inverse trend of PSA concentration and energy intake was similar in for men BMI>30, but not statistically significant ( Table 3 ). Differently, PSA concentrations were similar across BMI categories when evaluated within each level of fat intake, carbohydrate intake and physical activity (data not shown). Further, when these relationships were re-sevaluated separately within each racial subgroup, the directions of the associations were similar for each race (data now shown).  Associations between PSA and physiologic factors PSA concentrations were determined among people with and without insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome (n = 1,200). PSA concentrations were lower among men with insulin resistance (p=0.04), after adjustment for age, race and BMI, but not among men with metabolic syndrome. Additional adjustment for survey year (NHANES 2001-2002 or NHANES 2003-2004) did not change these associations. For exploratory purposes, when we investigated the relation of PSA with the two physiologic factors, within three BMI categories (<25, 25-30, 30+), we noted that PSA concentrations did not differ by insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome (data not shown). Further, when the number of metabolic abnormalities, treated as a continuous variable, was evaluated in relation with PSA, we noted no associations in the whole population (p = 0.12). These relationships were consistent when evaluated within each racial subgroup (data not shown).  METHODS Study population We combined data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2002 and 2003-2004 study populations, two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys of the civilian non-institutionalized population of the US. Details of the procedures involved in sampling and data collection have been published elsewhere ( 15 ). All procedures were approved by the National Center for Health Statistics institutional review board; a written, informed consent was obtained from all participants. Of 3,108 men aged 40+ years, those who underwent a recent rectal digital examination in the past week prostate biopsy in the past 30 days, cytoscopy in the past 30 days, or had a history of prostate cancer or current prostate inflammation (n=203) were ineligible for PSA testing in NHANES, and were excluded from this study ( 16 ), since these conditions cause PSA levels to be elevated. We also excluded participants for whom there were no data available for PSA eligibility criteria (n=359) or with missing body mass index (BMI) (n=88), leaving 2,458 men in the analyses dataset. These exclusion criteria are consistent with previously published data from NHANES 2001-2004 study population ( 7 ). Exposure variables Diet was estimated from the 24-hour dietary recall during an in-person interview for both the NHANES study populations. For the study participants of the NHANES 2003-2004, a second 24-hour recall was done over the phone as a follow-up. However, to ensure consistency across the two surveys, we assessed energy intake for these participants from the in-person 24-hour recall. We determined the level of leisure-time physical activity from responses to a series of questions asked in the interview about physical activity performed during the past 30 days. Participants were considered to be physically active if they mentioned any leisure-time physical activity. To ascertain whether the men were vigorously active, they were queried whether they performed any activity that caused heavy sweating, or large increases in breathing or heart rate, e.g. swimming, aerobics, or fast cycling. For moderate physical activity, participants were queried whether they performed any activities that caused light sweating or a moderate increase in the heart rate, for example playing golf, dancing, bicycling for pleasure, or walking. Individuals who did not report participating in either moderate or vigorous were considered to be sedentary. Participant age, race/ethnicity, smoking history, years of education, and history of doctor-diagnosed medical conditions including hypertension were self-reported in a structured personal interview ( 17 ). Serum PSA, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations were estimated from blood samples collected in the MEC exam ( 18 , 19 ). Fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, measured in a subpopulation of participants 12+ years examined in the morning session after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours, were used to computed insulin resistance using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) algorithm, where a value of 2.4 or higher was considered insulin resistant ( 20 ). Insulin concentrations were assayed using different laboratory methods in NHANES 2001-2002 and NHANES 2003-2004, Pharmacia and Tosoh method, respectively. Therefore, we used the regression coefficient (Y(tosoh) = (1.0027*pharmacia values)-2.2934) recommended by NHANES, to make the values comparable when combining the data from the two surveys. Weight, height, and waist circumference were measured in the MEC using standardized procedures. Based on the the Adult Treatment Panel III( 21 ), metabolic syndrome was defined as the presence of 3 of 5 criteria: 1) Waist circumference >102 cm in men, 2) Hypertension (self-reported physician-diagnosed), 3) High fasting glucose >100 md/dl or 6.1 mmol/L, 4) Hypertriglyceridemia >150 mg/dl or 1.695 mmol/L, 5) Low HDL cholesterol: <40 mg/dl or1.036 mmol/L in men. For this study, BMI (wt(kgs)/ht(meters)2 was categorized as lean (<25); overweight (25-30); and obese (30+) per the World Health Organization definitions ( 22 ). Statistical analyses Serum PSA concentrations were not normally distributed, therefore we log-transformed PSA. We calculated percent of total energy consumed from dietary fats and carbohydrate. Total energy, percent fat and carbohydrate intakes were divided into tertiles; and physical activity was defined as a dichotomous variable (sedentary/moderate to intense activity). We computed geometric mean PSA by intake levels of energy, fat, and carbohydrate and level of physical activity. We next computed geometric mean PSA concentration for two physiological factors associated with obesity: status of insulin resistance (dichotomous; yes/no) and metabolic syndrome (dichotomous; yes/no). We adjusted the geometric mean PSA concentrations for age, race and BMI, since these variables were associated with PSA in this sample ( 7 , 23 ). Additionally, we included a variable for survey year (NHANES 2001-2002 or NHANES 2003-2004) in the models. P-values comparing PSA for the highest and lowest tertile of energy, carbohydrate and fat intake, level of physical activity, and PSA among men with versus without insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, were calculated based on two-sample unequal-variance t-tests with Satterthwaite approximation of degree of freedom. Further, for metabolic syndrome, we explored the association of PSA with the number of metabolic abnormalities as a continuous variable (with values ranging from 0-5) to investigate whether the cumulative effect of the biochemical derangements, that are components of metabolic syndrome, influence PSA concentrations. In separate models, we repeated all analyses for the three racial subgroups (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans). Additionally, we explored the impact of the joint exposure of BMI categorized as lean (<25), overweight (25-30) obese (30-35) and very obese (35+) and each lifestyle or physiological factor, on PSA. Because the results were in a similar direction for the obese (BMI = 30-35) and very obese men (BMI = 35+), we combined the two groups to increase power. NHANES 2001-2004 sample weights were applied in all the analyses to account for individual selection probabilities, non-response and post-stratification that resulted from the complex survey design. All analyses were done using SAS® version 9 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).  Study population We combined data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2002 and 2003-2004 study populations, two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys of the civilian non-institutionalized population of the US.

These relationships were consistent when evaluated within each racial subgroup (data not shown).  DISCUSSION The purpose of this study was to identify physiological and lifestyle factors, associated with obesity, that may explain in part, the previously observed inverse associations between obesity and PSA ( 2 - 7 ). Werny et al ( 7 ) reported that PSA concentrations were lower among men with higher BMI, in the NHANES 2001-2004 population. We now extend these investigations in the same nationally representative population to evaluate the association of PSA concentrations with obesity related lifestyle factors (diet and physical activity) and physiologic factors (metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance). Data from this large sample of American men, who had not undergone a recent digital rectal examination, prostate biopsy or had a history of prostate cancer or prostatic inflammation, suggests that higher energy intake was inversely associated with PSA concentrations. Furthermore, when we explored the joint exposure of higher body weight and higher energy intake, we noted that PSA concentrations were lower among men with a BMI 25-30 who reported higher energy intakes (n = 1,067; p=0.001), possibly suggesting that energy and PSA are associated independently of BMI. A similar association, which was not statistically significant, was observed among men with BMI >30 (n = 746; p=0.09). This specific result implying that PSA levels of obese or overweight men consuming higher energy, may be lower than the actual value, has potential public health significance since majority of American men are overweight or obese ( 1 ), as reflected in this present study sample (median BMI = 28 and waist size is 102 cm. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the inverse association between energy and PSA among overweight men may be obtained due to chance. It must be noted that in this dataset, energy intake was measured using a 24-hour recall, and like any other dietary assessment tool, may contribute to measurement error in the estimation of energy intake. Therefore, the inverse associations that we note between energy and PSA concentration, in this population may be attenuated, due to misclassification of energy intake. Our finding of an inverse association between PSA and self-reported energy intake differs from the results of the large Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT), a volunteer-based trial, which noted no associations with PSA and quintile of energy intake, estimated from a food frequency questionnaire, in the past year ( 12 ). A plausible explanation for the lower PSA concentrations among men with higher energy intakes in this sample may be due to inverse associations of energy and testosterone concentrations, which modulate PSA production in the prostate gland. In laboratory animals long-term energy restriction enhanced production of serum testosterone, compared to rats fed ad libitum , thereby suggesting that higher energy intake may be involved in lower testosterone concentrations ( 24 ). In a small study (n=36), Fontana et al ( 25 ) reported a non-significant suggestion of lower serum testosterone in men on typical high-caloric western diets. Further, it has been shown that PSA gene expression is closely linked with free testosterone concentrations ( 26 ). However, there may be unidentified alternate biochemical mechanisms through which higher energy intakes may relate to PSA concentration. We also note that men with insulin resistance had significantly lower PSA concentrations compared to men without insulin resistance, after adjusting for age, race and BMI. The underlying mechanisms are unclear at this time; however, insulin resistance may also be associated with lower testosterone concentrations ( 27 ), which in turn may relate to lower PSA production as outlined in Figure 1 . When we investigated PSA concentrations and insulin resistance within BMI categories, PSA was not related to insulin resistance. This could possibly be due to reduced power, because insulin resistance was only estimated in a sub-sample of NHANES participants (n=1,200). Differently from the associations observed between insulin resistance and PSA, we did not find any difference in PSA concentrations among men with or without metabolic syndrome, or the number of metabolic abnormalities present among these men. We also observed no associations between PSA and percent energy from fat or carbohydrate intake, and level of physical activity, in this dataset. These observations were consistent with the lack of association between fat and carbohydrate intake and PSA in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial ( 12 ). Similarly, data from two other prospective dietary intervention trials ( 28 , 29 ) among men who were randomized to low-fat, high fruit and vegetable diets, showed no impact of such diets on PSA concentrations, compared to control diets higher in fats. Furthermore, consistent with other studies, PSA concentrations did not differ with level of physical activity in this population ( 12 , 13 ). Some limitations need to be considered when interpreting the results of our study. The NHANES 2001-2004 is a cross-sectional survey that ascertained PSA concentrations at the same time as diet, physical activity and blood levels. As in all dietary assessment tools used in nutritional epidemiology studies, there is likely to be the unavoidable measurement error of dietary energy, fat and carbohydrate intake. However, we minimize this bias in our analyses by drawing conclusions based on comparison of extreme groups of energy, fat and carbohydrate intakes. Despite our analytic strategy residual confounding relating to measuring diet imperfectly, or over only short periods of time (24-hours) is likely to remain, so that associations of dietary intake to PSA concentrations are likely to reflect this fact, at least in part. Although the NHANES anthropometric measurements were standardized and field-tested, BMI may be subject to measurement error, biasing results towards the null. The levels of physical activity in this dataset were self-reported. The lack of association between physical activity levels and PSA may be due to misclassification of physical activity levels. Further, the level of physical activity was queried for the past 30 days; therefore we were unable to determine the longer-term physical activity level among these participants. The relationships of physical activity, obesity and PSA needs to be investigated in other populations using more objective measures of physical activity or can evaluate longer term exposure. Another limitation of this study is that there might be about 24% men with undiagnosed prostate cancer, as suggested by the PCPT study, a large clinical trial (add ref for the PCPT trial). Lastly, there may also be undetected prostate infection and inflammation in this population. The inability to exclude men with these conditions might cause PSA concentrations to be higher in our study population. In conclusion, our findings of inverse associations between two factors associated with obesity, energy intake and insulin resistance, with PSA concentrations are provocative and may have important implications on prostate cancer detection among American men. PSA is a common test used to screen for prostate cancer and obesity is a public health concern in the US, with about 74-78% of the men, 40 years or older, being either overweight or obese ( 1 ). These results suggest that insulin resistant men and men who are on higher energy intakes, are less likely to have elevated PSA, and may not reach the biopsy threshold. Accordingly, PSA velocity may be more valuable to identify progressive prostate cancer among these men. The biochemical mechanisms of how higher energy intake modulates a decrease in PSA production is unclear at this time, and further studies are required to investigate this issue. The interrelationships of PSA, obesity, energy or fat intake, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome require clarity in other populations, specifically in studies using a prospective design and studies using better measures of diet. The confirmation of these relationships in additional studies may lead to more accurate interpretation of this important screening analyte.  DISCUSSION The purpose of this study was to identify physiological and lifestyle factors, associated with obesity, that may explain in part, the previously observed inverse associations between obesity and PSA ( 2 - 7 ). Werny et al ( 7 ) reported that PSA concentrations were lower among men with higher BMI, in the NHANES 2001-2004 population. We now extend these investigations in the same nationally representative population to evaluate the association of PSA concentrations with obesity related lifestyle factors (diet and physical activity) and physiologic factors (metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance). Data from this large sample of American men, who had not undergone a recent digital rectal examination, prostate biopsy or had a history of prostate cancer or prostatic inflammation, suggests that higher energy intake was inversely associated with PSA concentrations. Furthermore, when we explored the joint exposure of higher body weight and higher energy intake, we noted that PSA concentrations were lower among men with a BMI 25-30 who reported higher energy intakes (n = 1,067; p=0.001), possibly suggesting that energy and PSA are associated independently of BMI. A similar association, which was not statistically significant, was observed among men with BMI >30 (n = 746; p=0.09). This specific result implying that PSA levels of obese or overweight men consuming higher energy, may be lower than the actual value, has potential public health significance since majority of American men are overweight or obese ( 1 ), as reflected in this present study sample (median BMI = 28 and waist size is 102 cm. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the inverse association between energy and PSA among overweight men may be obtained due to chance. It must be noted that in this dataset, energy intake was measured using a 24-hour recall, and like any other dietary assessment tool, may contribute to measurement error in the estimation of energy intake. Therefore, the inverse associations that we note between energy and PSA concentration, in this population may be attenuated, due to misclassification of energy intake. Our finding of an inverse association between PSA and self-reported energy intake differs from the results of the large Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT), a volunteer-based trial, which noted no associations with PSA and quintile of energy intake, estimated from a food frequency questionnaire, in the past year ( 12 ). A plausible explanation for the lower PSA concentrations among men with higher energy intakes in this sample may be due to inverse associations of energy and testosterone concentrations, which modulate PSA production in the prostate gland. In laboratory animals long-term energy restriction enhanced production of serum testosterone, compared to rats fed ad libitum , thereby suggesting that higher energy intake may be involved in lower testosterone concentrations ( 24 ). In a small study (n=36), Fontana et al ( 25 ) reported a non-significant suggestion of lower serum testosterone in men on typical high-caloric western diets. Further, it has been shown that PSA gene expression is closely linked with free testosterone concentrations ( 26 ). However, there may be unidentified alternate biochemical mechanisms through which higher energy intakes may relate to PSA concentration. We also note that men with insulin resistance had significantly lower PSA concentrations compared to men without insulin resistance, after adjusting for age, race and BMI. The underlying mechanisms are unclear at this time; however, insulin resistance may also be associated with lower testosterone concentrations ( 27 ), which in turn may relate to lower PSA production as outlined in Figure 1 . When we investigated PSA concentrations and insulin resistance within BMI categories, PSA was not related to insulin resistance. This could possibly be due to reduced power, because insulin resistance was only estimated in a sub-sample of NHANES participants (n=1,200). Differently from the associations observed between insulin resistance and PSA, we did not find any difference in PSA concentrations among men with or without metabolic syndrome, or the number of metabolic abnormalities present among these men. We also observed no associations between PSA and percent energy from fat or carbohydrate intake, and level of physical activity, in this dataset. These observations were consistent with the lack of association between fat and carbohydrate intake and PSA in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial ( 12 ). Similarly, data from two other prospective dietary intervention trials ( 28 , 29 ) among men who were randomized to low-fat, high fruit and vegetable diets, showed no impact of such diets on PSA concentrations, compared to control diets higher in fats. Furthermore, consistent with other studies, PSA concentrations did not differ with level of physical activity in this population ( 12 , 13 ). Some limitations need to be considered when interpreting the results of our study. The NHANES 2001-2004 is a cross-sectional survey that ascertained PSA concentrations at the same time as diet, physical activity and blood levels. As in all dietary assessment tools used in nutritional epidemiology studies, there is likely to be the unavoidable measurement error of dietary energy, fat and carbohydrate intake. However, we minimize this bias in our analyses by drawing conclusions based on comparison of extreme groups of energy, fat and carbohydrate intakes. Despite our analytic strategy residual confounding relating to measuring diet imperfectly, or over only short periods of time (24-hours) is likely to remain, so that associations of dietary intake to PSA concentrations are likely to reflect this fact, at least in part. Although the NHANES anthropometric measurements were standardized and field-tested, BMI may be subject to measurement error, biasing results towards the null. The levels of physical activity in this dataset were self-reported. The lack of association between physical activity levels and PSA may be due to misclassification of physical activity levels. Further, the level of physical activity was queried for the past 30 days; therefore we were unable to determine the longer-term physical activity level among these participants. The relationships of physical activity, obesity and PSA needs to be investigated in other populations using more objective measures of physical activity or can evaluate longer term exposure. Another limitation of this study is that there might be about 24% men with undiagnosed prostate cancer, as suggested by the PCPT study, a large clinical trial (add ref for the PCPT trial). Lastly, there may also be undetected prostate infection and inflammation in this population. The inability to exclude men with these conditions might cause PSA concentrations to be higher in our study population. In conclusion, our findings of inverse associations between two factors associated with obesity, energy intake and insulin resistance, with PSA concentrations are provocative and may have important implications on prostate cancer detection among American men. PSA is a common test used to screen for prostate cancer and obesity is a public health concern in the US, with about 74-78% of the men, 40 years or older, being either overweight or obese ( 1 ). These results suggest that insulin resistant men and men who are on higher energy intakes, are less likely to have elevated PSA, and may not reach the biopsy threshold. Accordingly, PSA velocity may be more valuable to identify progressive prostate cancer among these men. The biochemical mechanisms of how higher energy intake modulates a decrease in PSA production is unclear at this time, and further studies are required to investigate this issue. The interrelationships of PSA, obesity, energy or fat intake, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome require clarity in other populations, specifically in studies using a prospective design and studies using better measures of diet. The confirmation of these relationships in additional studies may lead to more accurate interpretation of this important screening analyte.  Figure and Tables Figure 1 The proposed relationship between PSA and lifestyle and physiologic factors, associated with obesity We hypothesize that lifestyle and physiologic factors associated with obesity, including higher fat, carbohydrate and energy intake and lower level of physical activity, the presence of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome are associated with lower PSA concentrations. This phenomenon may lead to the lower-detection of prostate cancer in the population.
