Early deficits in motor coordination and cognitive dysfunction in a mouse model of the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder, Sandhoff disease Mouse models of lysosomal storage diseases, including Sandhoff disease, are frequently employed to test therapies directed at the central nervous system. We backbred such mice and conducted a behavioral test battery which included sensorimotor and cognitive assessments. This is the first report of short-term memory deficits in a murine model of Sandhoff disease. We also document early onset of motor deficits using the balance beam test.
