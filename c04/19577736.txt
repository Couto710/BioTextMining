Nuclear Pore Proteins and Cancer Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of macromolecules, a highly specific and tightly regulated process, occurs exclusively through the Nuclear Pore Complex. This immense structure is assembled from approximately 30 proteins, termed nucleoporins. Here we discuss the four nucleoporins that have been linked to cancers, either through elevated expression in tumors (Nup88) or through involvement in chromosomal translocations that encode chimeric fusion proteins (Tpr, Nup98, Nup214). In each case we consider the normal function of the nucleoporin and its translocation partners, as well as what is known about their mechanistic contributions to carcinogenesis, particularly in leukemias. Studies of nucleoporin-linked cancers have revealed novel mechanisms of oncogenesis and. in the future, should continue to expand our understanding of cancer biology.  Conclusions The study of nucleoporins and their roles in cancer has been a fruitful one, revealing novel mechanisms by which cells are advanced along the path to transformation. From our current level of understanding, each nucleoporin contributing to in carcinognesis seems to do so in a unique manner. It is somewhat surprising that, in the case of nucleoporin translocations, defects in nuclear transport have not been reported. Patient cells are heterozygous for these translocations and thus the level of the nucleoporin involved should be halved. This has not been thoroughly investigated, but perhaps the NPC is remarkably able to compensate for reduction in the level of many of its components thus circumventing selection against nucleoporin-based transformation. A recent report indicated that knockout of Nup358 also leads to increased aneuploidy in mice ( 122 ) although this nucleoporin has not yet been implicated in any form of cancer. It may be that additional Nups will prove to contribute to cancer in novel ways and the ongoing study of nucleoporin-induced cancers may continue to uncover surprising new mechanisms in cancer biology.  Figures and Tables Figure 1 Structural organization of the Nuclear Pore Complex Left : a cutaway representation of the organization of the NPC with the major structural elements indicated. Three of the eight repeating segments that give the NPC 8-fold rotational symmetry are illustrated. Right: Schematic of nucleoporin subcomplexes and approximate position within the NPC. Substructures are color coded to match the left side of the panel. Figure 2 Nucleoporin structure and rearrangement following chromosomal translocations The four nucleoporins discussed are depicted with major structural elements, along with their translocation partners, if applicable, and the structure of the resulting chimeric fusion proteins. Abbreviations: ?-prop, ?-propeller; c-c, coiled-coil; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; P/S, proline, serine rich; TM, transmembrane; JM, juxtamembrane; HD, homeodomain; BD, binding domain; Ub, ubiquitination; P, phosphorylation. Figure 3 Model for Nup98 fusions Nup98 fusion proteins are proposed to interact with chromatin directly through their homeodomain as depicted here or indirectly through the binding activity of otherfusion partners, e.g. NSD1 as part of a histone methyltransferase complex. The FG/GLFG repeat domain recruits chromatin modifying complexes such as CBP/p300 or HDAC1 which leads to altered transcription of target genes. The basis for target gene selection is not understood.
