The novel HSP90 inhibitor STA-9090 exhibits activity against Kit-dependent and -independent malignant mast cell tumors Objective Mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit occur in several human and canine cancers. While Kit inhibitors have activity in the clinical setting, they possess variable efficacy against particular forms of mutant Kit and drug resistance often develops over time. Inhibitors of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a chaperone for which Kit is a client protein, have demonstrated activity against human cancers and evidence suggests they downregulate several mutated and imatinib-resistant forms of Kit. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel HSP90 inhibitor, STA-9090, against wild-type (WT) and mutant Kit in canine bone marrow–derived cultured mast cells (BMCMCs), malignant mast cell lines, and fresh malignant mast cells. Materials and Methods BMCMCs, cell lines, and fresh malignant mast cells were treated with STA-9090, 17-AAG, and SU11654 and evaluated for loss in cell viability, cell death, alterations in HSP90 and Kit expression/signaling, and Kit mutation. STA-9090 activity was tested in a canine mastocytoma xenograft model. Results Treatment of BMCMCs, cell lines, and fresh malignant cells with STA-9090 induced growth inhibition, apoptosis that was caspase-3/7–dependent, and downregulation of phospho/total Kit and Akt, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-3K). Loss of Kit cell-surface expression was also observed. Furthermore, STA-9090 exhibited superior activity to 17-AAG and SU11654, and was effective against malignant mast cells expressing either WT or mutant Kit. Lastly, STA-9090 inhibited tumor growth in a canine mastocytoma mouse xenograft model. Conclusions STA-9090 exhibits broad activity against mast cells expressing WT or mutant Kit, suggesting it may be an effective agent in the clinical setting against mast cell malignancies.

Kisseberth (College of Veterinary Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA). Antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA; anti-p-Kit Tyr719, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK], p-Akt Thr308 and Ser473, and total ERK), BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; anti-Akt, anti-p85 phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), canine CD34, CD117-phycoerythrin [PE] and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase [PARP]) Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, ?-actin, and HSP90 ?/?), Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA; anti-Kit), and Stressgen (San Diego, CA, USA; anti-HSP70). Cell culture The C2 and BR canine mastocytoma cell lines were maintained as described previously [ 14 ]. Canine bone marrow–derived mast cells (BMCMCs) were generated as described previously [ 38 , 39 ]. Primary neoplastic mast cells were collected from three dogs at Ohio State University. Tumor was digested in 1 mL Vercene (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), undigested connective tissue was removed by filtration, and cells were counted and stained with Wright's-Giemsa. In each sample approximately 70% to 90% of cells were mast cells. Analysis of cell viability and growth Canine BMCMCs, fresh neoplastic mast cells, C2 and BR cells were plated in 96-well plates in 150 uL and treated with STA-9090, 17-AAG, or OSU-03012 at various concentrations or SU11654 (100 nM, the established IC50 for Kit [ 14 ]) in the presence or absence of 50 ng/mL recombinant canine stem cell factor (rcSCF). Cell viability was evaluated using the WST-1 assay (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) or the CCK-8 kit (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Gaithers burg, MD, USA). Analysis of cell cycling and apoptosis C2 and BR cells (5 × 105) were cultured in complete medium and 1 × 105 canine BMCMCs were cultured in Stemline II with 50 ng/mL rcSCF and left untreated (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) or treated with STA-9090 or SU11654. Apoptosis was assessed at 24 and 48 hours using the Annexin-V–PE/7-amino-actinomycin D kit (BD Biosciences). Cell cycling was analyzed at 24 and 48 hours using propidium iodide staining as described previously [ 38 ]. To measure caspase-3/7 activity, C2 cells (1.5 × 104) were treated with STA-9090 for 24 hours and activity was detected by using SensoLyte AMC caspase-3/7 assay Kit (AnaSpec, San Jose, CA, USA). Flow cytometry Cells were collected and incubated in 100 ?L BD Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences) washed in a saponin-containing buffer then incubated with anti-HSP90?/? or anti-PI3K followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA, USA). Changes in Kit expression following treatment with either STA-9090 or SU11654 for 24 hours were assessed directly by flow cytometry. Western blotting C2 and BR cells were serum starved for 2 hours and treated with STA-9090 for 2 or 24 hours, then collected, lysed, and equal amounts of protein were separated by 6 % (Kit) or 10 % (ERK, Akt, PARP, HSP90, and HSP70) sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin/tris-buffered saline Tween-20, then incubated with primary phospho-antibody overnight at 4°C, washed, incubated with secondary antibody and developed using SuperSignal West Dura (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Blots were then stripped, blocked, and reprobed for total protein. To evaluate the association of Kit with HSP90 following STA-9090 treatment, C2 cells (30 × 106) were treated with DMSO or 100 nM STA-9090 for 8 hours. HSP90 was immunoprecipitated (anti-HSP90, Cell Signaling) followed by Trublot anti-rabbit agarose beads (E-Biosciences). After sodium dodecyl sulfate poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blotting was performed for HSP90 and Kit. Direct Western blotting on protein lysates was also performed to assess total protein levels of Kit and HSP90 in C2 cells after treatment with STA-9090 for 8 hours. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of cKit expression and cKit sequencing C2 and BR cells were treated with STA-9090 or SU11654 for 2 or 24 hours and RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). cDNA was made from 2 ?g total RNA by Superscript III kit (Invitrogen). cKit and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA were detected and cKit sequencing was performed using primer sets in Table 1 . Xenograft tumor model Female severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) were maintained in an specific pathogen free environment and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. C2 cells were suspended at 5 to 10 × 107 cells/mL in medium/50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and 0.1 mL was injected into the flanks. Tumors grew to 100 to 200 mm3 (day 8) then animals were randomized into treatment groups so tumor volumes were approximately 150 mm3/group. Tumor volumes (V) were calculated by caliper measurement of width (W), length (L), and thickness (T): V = 0.5236(LWT). STA-9090 stock solution in DMSO was diluted 1:10 with 20% Cremophor RH 40. The final formulation contained 10% DMSO, 18% Cremophor, 3.6% dextrose, 68.4% water, and STA-9090. Animals were treated by tail vein injection at 10 mL/kg and body weights were monitored daily.

Results HSP90 is not overexpressed in malignant canine mast cells We evaluated mastocytoma cell lines expressing Kit mutations (BR, point mutation in JM domain; C2, ITD in JM domain) [ 14 ], fresh primary malignant mast cells and normal canine BMCMCs for HSP90 expression by intracellular flow cytometry staining. All cells, expressed similar levels of HSP90 ( Fig. 1 ). Based on preliminary RNA microarray data, HSP90 RNA expression was not significantly different among canine BMCMCs, grade I and grade III MCTs (data not shown), suggesting that upregulation of HSP90 expression is not a common feature of malignant MCTs in dogs. STA-9090 induces apoptosis of malignant canine mast cell lines To evaluate the effects of HSP90 inhibition on canine malignant mast cells, we cultured the C2, BR, and canine BMCMCs with STA-9090 or SU11654 (a small-molecule inhibitor of Kit [ 14 ]) and assayed cell viability. Both the C2 line and BMCMCs exhibited significant growth inhibition in the presence of SU11654, while the BR line was somewhat resistant ( Fig. 2A ). However, C2, BR, and canine BMCMCs were all sensitive to STA-9090 at concentrations as low as 10 nM, with loss of cell viability observed after 24 hours of treatment. Additionally, we compared the activity of STA-9090 to 17-AAG in the C2 and BR cell lines and found that STA-9090 was active at significantly lower concentrations for both ( Fig. 2B , STA-9090 IC50 19 nm (C2) and 4 nm (BR) vs 17-AAG IC50 948 nm (C2) and 44 nm (BR)). To determine whether the growth inhibition was due to induction of cell death, we cultured the C2 and BR lines and canine BMCMCs with STA-9090 or SU11654, and assessed the cells for apoptosis. As shown in Figure 3A , apoptosis was observed in all lines after treatment with 100 nM STA-9090 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with SU11654, although the BR line was less sensitive to kinase inhibition than HSP90 inhibition. These data were confirmed with cell-cycle analysis using propidium iodide staining in which all cells showed significant cell death (sub-G1) following 24 and 48 hours of treatment with STA-9090 or SU11654 ( Fig. 3B ). The C2 and BR lines were then used to evaluate the ability of STA-9090 to induce caspase-mediated apoptosis. As shown in Figure 3C , cleaved PARP was detected 24 hours following treatment with STA-9090, while untreated cells maintained intact PARP. Cleaved PARP was also detected when C2 cells were treated with SU11654, but was less evident in BR cells treated with SU11654 concordant with our previous finding that BR cell line is somewhat less sensitive to Kit kinase inhibition. To confirm the role of caspase-3/7 in the observed apoptosis caspase activity was directly assessed in the C2 line after 24 hours of STA-9090 treatment ( Fig. 3C ). STA-9090 induces downregulation of Kit, but not PI3K or HSP90 To determine the effects of STA-9090 on WT or mutated Kit, we cultured cells with STA-9090 or SU11654 and evaluated Kit expression. Both WT and mutant Kit were downregulated by 100 nM STA-9090 after 24 hours in all lines treated ( Fig. 4A ). As expected, cells treated with SU11654 did not lose Kit expression. In contrast, the C2 line and BMCMCs upregulated Kit expression after SU11654 exposure, presumably as a feedback response following inhibition of Kit signaling. No effects on PI3K or HSP90 expression were observed following treatment with STA-9090 or SU11654 ( Fig. 4B ) STA-9090 treatment downregulates Akt expression and upregulates HSP70 expression in malignant mast cell lines C2 and BR cells were treated with STA-9090 or SU11654 for 2 or 24 hours and the effects on Kit, Akt, Erk, HSP70, and HSP90 were assessed ( Fig. 5A ). As expected, downregulation of Kit phosphorylation and expression were observed in both the C2 and BR lines after treatment with 100 and 1000 nM STA-9090 at 24 hours, while only modulation of Kit phosphorylation was observed following SU11654 treatment. Interestingly, the C2 line demonstrated more rapid modulation of Kit expression following STA-9090 treatment, in agreement with our flow data. This may reflect a greater sensitivity of Kit possessing an ITD to HSP90 inhibition compared to that possessing a point mutation in the JM domain. While we did not see modulation of PI3K expression in mast cell lines treated with STA-9090, Akt is known to be a client protein of HSP90. Figure 5A demonstrates that both STA-9090 and SU11654 inhibited phosphorylation of Akt in malignant mast cell line, although this occurred earlier (2 hours) in the SU11654-treated cells. Downregulation of Akt protein expression was observed in both STA-9090–treated cell lines at 24 hours of treatment, but was not seen following SU11654 treatment. In support of the notion that loss of Akt activity can impair malignant mast cell viability, C2 and BR cells treated with the small-molecule Akt inhibitor OSU-03012 [ 40 ] demonstrated a dose-dependent loss of cell viability ( Fig. 5B ). No differences were found in phosphorylated ERK and total ERK expression following treatment of the mast cell lines with either STA-9090 or SU11654. Lastly, upregulation of HSP70 has been reported as a consequence of HSP90 inhibition [ 41 – 43 ]. In agreement with this, we observed induction of HSP70 expression following exposure to STA-9090, but not SU11654 ( Fig. 5A ). To determine if modulation of Kit expression was secondary to loss of cKit mRNA, we performed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for c-Kit following treatment with STA-9090 or SU11654. cKit mRNA was relatively unchanged when compared to controls in both C2 and BR cells at 24 hours post STA-9090 exposure ( Fig. 5C ), a time point at which Kit protein expression was significantly downregulated (C2) or completely absent (BR). We next investigated whether loss of Kit expression was due to disruption of the association of HSP90 with Kit. As demonstrated in Figure 5D , treatment of C2 cells with STA-9090 induced the loss of Kit binding to HSP90 within 8 hours of drug exposure. STA-9090 induces downregulation of Kit expression, growth inhibition, and apoptosis in ex vivo fresh malignant canine mast cells Fresh malignant cells were isolated from two primary cutaneous tumors (MCT1 and MCT3) or following collection of abdominal effusion from a dog with systemic mastocytosis (MCT2). In all cases, >70% of isolated cell populations were neoplastic mast cells. Cells were cultured in complete medium with or without rcSCF, or with 50 ng/mL rcSCF and STA-9090 or SU11654 and cell viability was evaluated at 24, 48, and 72 hours of culture. As shown in Figure 6A , malignant mast cells cultured in the absence of rcSCF remained viable, although their proliferation was enhanced in the presence of rcSCF (MCT2 and MCT3). Dose-dependent growth inhibition was observed in all mast cell tumor samples following treatment with STA-9090. In contrast, there was no effect of SU11654 on viability of the malignant mast cells, suggesting that these tumor cells were not entirely dependent on Kit for their survival. In support of this, c-Kit was sequenced in all tumors and no mutations were identified in the coding sequences, indicating that ligand-independent Kit activation was not present (data not shown). Loss of cell viability in STA-9090–treated cells was secondary to apoptosis, as evidenced by Annexin-V/7-amino-actinomycin D staining and accumulation of Sub-G1 cells following cell-cycle analysis ( Fig. 6B ). STA-9090 induced downregulation of Kit surface expression in malignant mast cells, an effect that was not seen following SU11654 treatment ( Fig. 6C ). Similar to the C2 and BR lines, HSP90 expression was not altered in the fresh malignant mast cells after treatment with STA-9090 or SU11654 ( Fig. 6C ). STA-9090 inhibits in vivo tumor growth in a malignant mast cell xenograft model To evaluate STA-9090 in vivo we conducted a xenograft tumor model using the C2 line subcutaneously implanted into the flanks of SCID mice. STA-9090 significantly inhibited tumor growth ( Fig. 7 ) when dosed with two repeating cycles of 25 mg/kg/day for 3 days ( p < 0.001), with a %T/C value of 18 [ 44 ]. STA-9090 was well-tolerated, with the vehicle and STA-9090 groups having average bodyweight changes relative to the start of the study of +0.3% (±1.4 standard error of mean [SEM]) and ?8.1% (±1.6 SEM) on day 17, respectively.  Results HSP90 is not overexpressed in malignant canine mast cells We evaluated mastocytoma cell lines expressing Kit mutations (BR, point mutation in JM domain; C2, ITD in JM domain) [ 14 ], fresh primary malignant mast cells and normal canine BMCMCs for HSP90 expression by intracellular flow cytometry staining.

HSP90 is not overexpressed in malignant canine mast cells We evaluated mastocytoma cell lines expressing Kit mutations (BR, point mutation in JM domain; C2, ITD in JM domain) [ 14 ], fresh primary malignant mast cells and normal canine BMCMCs for HSP90 expression by intracellular flow cytometry staining. All cells, expressed similar levels of HSP90 ( Fig. 1 ). Based on preliminary RNA microarray data, HSP90 RNA expression was not significantly different among canine BMCMCs, grade I and grade III MCTs (data not shown), suggesting that upregulation of HSP90 expression is not a common feature of malignant MCTs in dogs.

STA-9090 induces apoptosis of malignant canine mast cell lines To evaluate the effects of HSP90 inhibition on canine malignant mast cells, we cultured the C2, BR, and canine BMCMCs with STA-9090 or SU11654 (a small-molecule inhibitor of Kit [ 14 ]) and assayed cell viability. Both the C2 line and BMCMCs exhibited significant growth inhibition in the presence of SU11654, while the BR line was somewhat resistant ( Fig. 2A ). However, C2, BR, and canine BMCMCs were all sensitive to STA-9090 at concentrations as low as 10 nM, with loss of cell viability observed after 24 hours of treatment. Additionally, we compared the activity of STA-9090 to 17-AAG in the C2 and BR cell lines and found that STA-9090 was active at significantly lower concentrations for both ( Fig. 2B , STA-9090 IC50 19 nm (C2) and 4 nm (BR) vs 17-AAG IC50 948 nm (C2) and 44 nm (BR)). To determine whether the growth inhibition was due to induction of cell death, we cultured the C2 and BR lines and canine BMCMCs with STA-9090 or SU11654, and assessed the cells for apoptosis. As shown in Figure 3A , apoptosis was observed in all lines after treatment with 100 nM STA-9090 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with SU11654, although the BR line was less sensitive to kinase inhibition than HSP90 inhibition. These data were confirmed with cell-cycle analysis using propidium iodide staining in which all cells showed significant cell death (sub-G1) following 24 and 48 hours of treatment with STA-9090 or SU11654 ( Fig. 3B ). The C2 and BR lines were then used to evaluate the ability of STA-9090 to induce caspase-mediated apoptosis. As shown in Figure 3C , cleaved PARP was detected 24 hours following treatment with STA-9090, while untreated cells maintained intact PARP. Cleaved PARP was also detected when C2 cells were treated with SU11654, but was less evident in BR cells treated with SU11654 concordant with our previous finding that BR cell line is somewhat less sensitive to Kit kinase inhibition. To confirm the role of caspase-3/7 in the observed apoptosis caspase activity was directly assessed in the C2 line after 24 hours of STA-9090 treatment ( Fig. 3C ).  STA-9090 induces apoptosis of malignant canine mast cell lines To evaluate the effects of HSP90 inhibition on canine malignant mast cells, we cultured the C2, BR, and canine BMCMCs with STA-9090 or SU11654 (a small-molecule inhibitor of Kit [ 14 ]) and assayed cell viability.

To confirm the role of caspase-3/7 in the observed apoptosis caspase activity was directly assessed in the C2 line after 24 hours of STA-9090 treatment ( Fig. 3C ).  STA-9090 induces downregulation of Kit, but not PI3K or HSP90 To determine the effects of STA-9090 on WT or mutated Kit, we cultured cells with STA-9090 or SU11654 and evaluated Kit expression. Both WT and mutant Kit were downregulated by 100 nM STA-9090 after 24 hours in all lines treated ( Fig. 4A ). As expected, cells treated with SU11654 did not lose Kit expression. In contrast, the C2 line and BMCMCs upregulated Kit expression after SU11654 exposure, presumably as a feedback response following inhibition of Kit signaling. No effects on PI3K or HSP90 expression were observed following treatment with STA-9090 or SU11654 ( Fig. 4B )  STA-9090 induces downregulation of Kit, but not PI3K or HSP90 To determine the effects of STA-9090 on WT or mutated Kit, we cultured cells with STA-9090 or SU11654 and evaluated Kit expression.

No effects on PI3K or HSP90 expression were observed following treatment with STA-9090 or SU11654 ( Fig. 4B )  STA-9090 treatment downregulates Akt expression and upregulates HSP70 expression in malignant mast cell lines C2 and BR cells were treated with STA-9090 or SU11654 for 2 or 24 hours and the effects on Kit, Akt, Erk, HSP70, and HSP90 were assessed ( Fig. 5A ). As expected, downregulation of Kit phosphorylation and expression were observed in both the C2 and BR lines after treatment with 100 and 1000 nM STA-9090 at 24 hours, while only modulation of Kit phosphorylation was observed following SU11654 treatment. Interestingly, the C2 line demonstrated more rapid modulation of Kit expression following STA-9090 treatment, in agreement with our flow data. This may reflect a greater sensitivity of Kit possessing an ITD to HSP90 inhibition compared to that possessing a point mutation in the JM domain. While we did not see modulation of PI3K expression in mast cell lines treated with STA-9090, Akt is known to be a client protein of HSP90. Figure 5A demonstrates that both STA-9090 and SU11654 inhibited phosphorylation of Akt in malignant mast cell line, although this occurred earlier (2 hours) in the SU11654-treated cells. Downregulation of Akt protein expression was observed in both STA-9090–treated cell lines at 24 hours of treatment, but was not seen following SU11654 treatment. In support of the notion that loss of Akt activity can impair malignant mast cell viability, C2 and BR cells treated with the small-molecule Akt inhibitor OSU-03012 [ 40 ] demonstrated a dose-dependent loss of cell viability ( Fig. 5B ). No differences were found in phosphorylated ERK and total ERK expression following treatment of the mast cell lines with either STA-9090 or SU11654. Lastly, upregulation of HSP70 has been reported as a consequence of HSP90 inhibition [ 41 – 43 ]. In agreement with this, we observed induction of HSP70 expression following exposure to STA-9090, but not SU11654 ( Fig. 5A ). To determine if modulation of Kit expression was secondary to loss of cKit mRNA, we performed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for c-Kit following treatment with STA-9090 or SU11654. cKit mRNA was relatively unchanged when compared to controls in both C2 and BR cells at 24 hours post STA-9090 exposure ( Fig. 5C ), a time point at which Kit protein expression was significantly downregulated (C2) or completely absent (BR). We next investigated whether loss of Kit expression was due to disruption of the association of HSP90 with Kit. As demonstrated in Figure 5D , treatment of C2 cells with STA-9090 induced the loss of Kit binding to HSP90 within 8 hours of drug exposure.  STA-9090 treatment downregulates Akt expression and upregulates HSP70 expression in malignant mast cell lines C2 and BR cells were treated with STA-9090 or SU11654 for 2 or 24 hours and the effects on Kit, Akt, Erk, HSP70, and HSP90 were assessed ( Fig. 5A ).

As demonstrated in Figure 5D , treatment of C2 cells with STA-9090 induced the loss of Kit binding to HSP90 within 8 hours of drug exposure.  STA-9090 induces downregulation of Kit expression, growth inhibition, and apoptosis in ex vivo fresh malignant canine mast cells Fresh malignant cells were isolated from two primary cutaneous tumors (MCT1 and MCT3) or following collection of abdominal effusion from a dog with systemic mastocytosis (MCT2). In all cases, >70% of isolated cell populations were neoplastic mast cells. Cells were cultured in complete medium with or without rcSCF, or with 50 ng/mL rcSCF and STA-9090 or SU11654 and cell viability was evaluated at 24, 48, and 72 hours of culture. As shown in Figure 6A , malignant mast cells cultured in the absence of rcSCF remained viable, although their proliferation was enhanced in the presence of rcSCF (MCT2 and MCT3). Dose-dependent growth inhibition was observed in all mast cell tumor samples following treatment with STA-9090. In contrast, there was no effect of SU11654 on viability of the malignant mast cells, suggesting that these tumor cells were not entirely dependent on Kit for their survival. In support of this, c-Kit was sequenced in all tumors and no mutations were identified in the coding sequences, indicating that ligand-independent Kit activation was not present (data not shown). Loss of cell viability in STA-9090–treated cells was secondary to apoptosis, as evidenced by Annexin-V/7-amino-actinomycin D staining and accumulation of Sub-G1 cells following cell-cycle analysis ( Fig. 6B ). STA-9090 induced downregulation of Kit surface expression in malignant mast cells, an effect that was not seen following SU11654 treatment ( Fig. 6C ). Similar to the C2 and BR lines, HSP90 expression was not altered in the fresh malignant mast cells after treatment with STA-9090 or SU11654 ( Fig. 6C ).

STA-9090 inhibits in vivo tumor growth in a malignant mast cell xenograft model To evaluate STA-9090 in vivo we conducted a xenograft tumor model using the C2 line subcutaneously implanted into the flanks of SCID mice. STA-9090 significantly inhibited tumor growth ( Fig. 7 ) when dosed with two repeating cycles of 25 mg/kg/day for 3 days ( p < 0.001), with a %T/C value of 18 [ 44 ]. STA-9090 was well-tolerated, with the vehicle and STA-9090 groups having average bodyweight changes relative to the start of the study of +0.3% (±1.4 standard error of mean [SEM]) and ?8.1% (±1.6 SEM) on day 17, respectively.

Discussion Kit mutations resulting in ligand-independent activation occur frequently in human and canine cancers, including systemic mastocytosis, GISTs, and acute myeloid leukemia [ 4 , 5 , 9 , 17 ]. Several small-molecule Kit inhibitors have been developed and these demonstrate significant activity in the clinical setting (imatinib [ 45 ], sunitinib [ 18 ], and dasatinib [ 46 ]). However, they have variable efficacy against particular forms of mutant Kit and resistance to therapy often develops over time [ 47 ]. Recently, HSP90 has arisen as a promising target for therapeutic intervention in Kit-dependent tumors. Work with human malignant mast cell and GIST lines demonstrated that the geldanamycin derivative 17-AAG has potent activity against these cells, regardless of the nature of Kit mutation [ 47 – 50 ]. However, the geldanamycins have limitations, including low solubility and hepatotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate STA-9090 (Synta Pharmaceuticals Corp.), a triazolone HSP90 inhibitor unrelated to geldanamycin, against WT and mutant Kit, using canine malignant mast cells as a model of Kit dysregulation. STA-9090 inhibited cell proliferation and induced loss of cell viability in normal canine BMCMCs and the C2 and BR malignant mast cell lines that carry activating JM domain mutations that induce sensitivity to the small-molecule inhibitor SU11654 [ 11 , 14 ]. The biologic activity of STA-9090 at 10 nM was similar to that seen with 100 nM SU11654, a drug concentration previously shown to be effective both in vitro and in vivo [ 14 , 15 ]. The activity of STA-9090 against BMCMCs was not unexpected, as our prior studies demonstrated that these cells are dependent on SCF-induced Kit signaling for proliferation and survival in vitro [ 38 ]. It is possible that resident tissue mast cells are less sensitive to HSP90 inhibition in vivo as they are typically not actively cycling and may receive survival signals through additional pathways, such as inter-leukin (IL)-3 and IL-9. The BR cell line was slightly more resistant to SU11654 treatment when compared to the C2 line, but exhibited equivalent sensitivity to STA-9090, supporting the notion that HSP90 inhibitors may have a broad spectrum of activity against various Kit mutants. Downregulation of Kit phosphorylation occurred rapidly following treatment with either STA-9090 or SU11654 in the C2 and BR lines. Work with GIST lines expressing Kit with JM domain mutations demonstrated a similar rapid time course after 17-AAG treatment [ 22 ]. Loss of Kit expression was also observed in the human mast cell lines HMC1.1 and HMC1.2 harboring Vla560Gly and Val560Gly/Aps816Val mutations, respectively, in the presence of 17-AAG [ 48 ]. However, higher concentrations of 17-AAG were required (500–1000 nM) when compared to those needed to modulate Kit with STA-9090 (100 nM), consistent with our data directly comparing STA-9090 and 17-AAG in the canine lines. Interestingly, alterations in Kit protein expression were variable in GIST lines after 17-AAG exposure [ 22 ], indicating that HSP90 may play a more important role in neoplastic mast cells with respect to Kit expression than in GISTs. Alteration of Akt may explain, in part, the sensitivity of so many different neoplastic cell lines to HSP90 inhibition [ 48 , 51 ]. STA-9090 induced a dose-dependent decrease in Akt phosphorylation and expression in the malignant mast cell lines, while SU11654 altered Akt phosphorylation but not expression. In contrast, significant alteration of Akt expression was not observed in GIST lines following 17-AAG exposure [ 47 ]. Although some modulation of Akt was found in the HMC1.1/1.2 cells in the presence of 17-AAG [ 48 ], this was less substantial than that observed in the present study, suggesting that STA-9090 may be a more potent inhibitor of HSP90 and thus exhibit a wider range of client protein modulation. In support of this, we observed dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability in C2 and BR cells treated with the Akt inhibitor OSU-03012, suggesting an important role for Akt in malignant mast cell survival. Recent evidence indicates that chaperone activity is important in maintaining the mitochondrial protective network. HSP90 and a related molecule TRAP-1 have been identified in the mitochondria of tumor cells, but not normal cells [ 52 ]. Direct targeting of 17-AAG to the mitochondria of tumor cells resulted in loss of mitochondrial function and cell death. While it is not known if STA-9090 is capable of penetrating the mitochondrial membrane, it possible that at least some of the biologic activity of STA-9090 is secondary to loss of mitochondrial function in the malignant mast cells and studies are ongoing to investigate this possibility. However, this is unlikely to be the primary mechanism of cell death as small molecule inhibitors of Kit induce apoptosis of malignant mast cells within 24 to 72 hours of exposure, supporting the notion that Kit signaling is critical for their survival. Additionally, our data show a rapid loss of Kit association with HSP90 following STA-9090 treatment, indicating a direct effect of STA-9090 on chaperone activity. Lastly, inhibition of Akt activity reduced malignant mast cell viability, suggesting that the ability of STA-9090 to target multiple pathways in these cells contributes to the observed rapid apoptosis of these cells following drug exposure. We verified our findings in fresh neoplastic mast cells isolated from canine MCTs. These may be more reflective of cancer cells in vivo , having not adapted to in vitro culture conditions. These cells were sensitive to STA-9090 treatment, exhibiting growth inhibition, apoptosis, and downregulation of Kit expression. However, they were not dependent on SCF/Kit signaling for survival, as little effect of SU11654 was observed and no activating mutations in Kit were identified. It is possible that modulation of additional targets of STA-9090 (i.e., Akt) were responsible for the observed biologic effects. Alternatively, Kit expression may be necessary for maintenance of malignant mast cells through its association with additional cell surface proteins. Although STA-9090 displayed potent cytotoxicity against in vitro , these assays involve prolonged exposure to the compound, which would be expected to poorly mimic the pharmacokinetics of drug exposure in vivo . We therefore confirmed the activity of STA-9090 in the C2 mast cell tumor xenograft model in SCID mice. Similar results have also been obtained in a mouse xenograft model conducted using the Kasumi-1 acute myeloid leukemia cell line expressing activated Kit (Asn822Lys) (K. Foley, unpublished data). In summary, STA-9090 exhibited significant activity against malignant mast cell lines and fresh malignant mast cells cultured ex vivo, and also inhibited tumor growth in vivo in a mast cell tumor xenograft model. Importantly, STA-9090 was effective on both Kit-dependent and Kit-independent tumor cells, suggesting a broad range of therapeutic activity. These studies serve as the foundation for future clinical trials of STA-9090 in dogs with spontaneous cancers, particularly MCTs, as a prelude to human clinical work.
