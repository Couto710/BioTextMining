KIR-HLA intercourse in HIV disease Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I loci are essential to an effective immune response against a wide variety of pathogenic microorganisms, and they represent the prototypes for genetic polymorphism that are sustained through balancing selection. The functional significance of HLA class I variation is better exemplified by studies involving HIV type 1 (HIV-1) than any other infectious organism. HLA class I molecules are essential to the acquired immune response, but they are also important in innate immunity as ligands for the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), which modulate natural killer cell activity. Here we concentrate on the interaction between the HLA-B and KIR3DL1/KIR3DS1 genes, describe the effects of these loci on HIV disease, and discuss questions that remain unresolved.  Concluding remarks Genetic association studies all indicate a role for KIR-HLA interactions in the control of HIV infection, but disagree on the exact nature of these associations. Generally, they demonstrate an association of KIR3DL1/S1 and HLA-B, either alone or in combination, with viral load, CD4 decline and/or progression to AIDS. More recent functional studies with NK cells expressing KIR3DS1 at least partially support a protective role for KIR3DS1 in HIV control, but fail to resolve the discrepancies among the genetic studies. The current challenge is to understand the molecular nature of the interactions among KIR, HLA and HIV. Such molecular studies could in turn help understand the divergent results obtained in the genetic association studies.
