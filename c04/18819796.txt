A novel monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor with analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity A variety of long chain 1,2-diamines and related compounds were synthesized and tested for their activity on fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacyglycerol lipase (MGL). (2 S ,9 Z )-Octadec-9-ene-1,2-diamine selectively inhibits MGL ( K i 21.8 ?M) without significantly affecting FAAH. This compound exhibited interesting in vivo analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting that selective inhibitors of MGL may be valuable novel agents for the treatment of inflammatory pain.
