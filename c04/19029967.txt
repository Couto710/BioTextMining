A novel approach for quantification of KIR expression in healthy donors and pediatric recipients of hematopoietic SCTs The killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) expression repertoire may offer valuable information for hematopoietic SCT (HSCT). We designed a quantitative KIR RNAtype assay and used it to determine KIR gene expression in healthy donors and patients before HSCT. The specificity of the assay was ensured by specific primers and by electrophoretic distinction of PCR products of unique length. In 87 healthy donors, the KIR repertoire was broadly distributed (32 categories of profiles). There was an overall trend toward inverse correlation of KIR expression level and donor age. Age affected mainly the activating KIR families. Leukemia patients showed lower KIR expression before transplantation than healthy donors. Stem cell mobilization caused a transient increase of KIR expression. We conclude that KIR expression differs quantitatively with age and primary disease and is transiently altered by stem cell recruitment and selection.  Introduction The killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs) are a group of polymorphic receptor families carried by natural killer (NK) cells that play an important role in the innate immune response. 1 KIRs are also expressed on a minor subset of memory/effector T cells that participate in acquired immunity. The expressed KIR repertoire of an individual is dependent primarily on the KIR genotype rather than the HLA genotype. 2 The KIR gene repertoire is diverse, being determined not only by gene locus but also by allelic polymorphism, corresponding to the heterogeneity of the HLA ligands. 1 With such extensive diversity, it is uncommon for two individuals to have the same KIR gene repertoire. 1 Killer cell Ig-like receptors regulate NK cell function through recognition of self-HLA class-I ligands, thus allowing inhibitory KIR (iKIR) to prevent NK cell injury of healthy autologous cells and allowing activating KIR (aKIR) to initiate NK cell activity against infected or transformed cells. 1 , 3 The ‘missing self’ hypothesis has been proposed to explain NK killing activation. 3 The diversity of the KIR repertoire and the balance between KIRs and their ligands affects susceptibility to many diseases such as autoimmune inflammatory diseases and malignancy. 1 In recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (HSCT), NK cells do not cause GVHD even when the donor and recipient are mismatched, because the graft NK cells attack only the mismatched host hematopoietic cells or transformed host cells that express little or no HLA class-I. 4 These advantages have made NK cell treatment an attractive option in allogeneic HSCT. Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the initiation of NK-mediated graft-versus-tumor effect. KIR–KIR repertoire mismatch appears to offer no significant benefit for survival, or for prevention of relapse or GVHD. 5 , 6 The consequence of an HLA ligand mismatch is controversial. Clinical advantages in survival, disease-free survival and GVHD prevention have been observed in recipients of related-donor, T-cell-depleted and HLA-mismatched transplants, but recipients of unrelated-donor transplants experienced increased graft failure. 7 Mismatch between donor KIR and recipient HLA ligand 8 was associated with a decreased relapse rate after allogeneic HSCT in pediatric leukemia patients 9 , 10 but showed no benefit in patients with SCID. 11 Most investigations have focused on the association of the KIR genotypes with disease or post transplant effects. Few reports have described KIR repertoire expression, in part due to the unavailability of specific MoAbs, especially those that can distinguish iKIRs from aKIRs (which differ only in their cytoplasmic tails). However, recent observations suggest that the genotype is not fully expressed transcriptionally or phenotypically, even in healthy individuals. 12 Further, some relevant donor KIR genes may be downregulated during hematologic reconstitution after HSCT, particularly when myeloablative conditioning is used. 13 Delayed appearance of KIR transcripts post transplant is reportedly associated with the risk of acute GVHD. 14 These results suggested to us that KIR expression undergoes kinetic changes that may affect the development of disease and the outcome of treatment. So far, there has been no clear characterization of KIR expression in the healthy population, in donors during stem cell recruitment and selection, or in patients during the peri-transplant period. We designed a novel assay (‘KIR-RNAtyping’) that uses our newly devised KIR primers to quantitatively determine repertoire expression. The CD56 transcript was used to control for changes in NK cell numbers. After confirming the specificity of the primers, we used this assay to quantify KIR expression in 87 healthy donors and 37 leukemia patients before HSCT. The impact of stem cell mobilization was also examined in 12 donors.  Methods Patients To establish a reference range, we examined KIR gene expression in 50 healthy sibling donors (16 F/34 M) matched to the patient age range (1–20 years). We also studied 37 healthy adult donors 21–51 years of age (15 F/22 M). A total off 73 samples were obtained from 37 patients (10 F/27 M) pre-transplantation and from 12 donors during stem cell processing. The 37 patients’ diagnoses included 18 ALL, 9 AML, 8 CML and 2 non-Hodgkin’s lymphocyte. This study was approved by the St Jude Children’s Research Hospital Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained from donors and from patients or their parents or guardians, as appropriate. KIR RNAtyping Killer cell Ig-like receptor RNAtyping consisted of reverse transcription-PCR and fragment electrophoresis on a genetic sequence analyzer. Total RNA (1 µg) was purified from 106 Ficoll-enriched PBMCs by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAgen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). cDNA was synthesized by using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR was performed in a volume of 25 µl containing 1/200 of the cDNA (corresponding to 5 ng original RNA), 1 × Ampli-Taq Gold Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ, USA), and 250 n m of 1 of 12 specific reverse (RV) primers combined with 1 of 2 forward (FW) primers conjugated to the fluorescent dye 6-FAM ( Table 1 ). The 2D FW primer was used with the RV primers 2DL1, 2DL2, 2DL3, 2DS1, 2DS2, 2DS3, 2DS4 and 2DS5. The 2DL4-3D FW primer was used with RV primers 2DL4, 2DL5, 3DL1, 3DL2 and 3DS1. The CD56-mRNA-encoding marker was used as an endogenous control to normalize for input RNA and to calculate the percentile of each KIR family in the total CD56 transcripts. The PCR condition was 95 °C for 10 min followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 60 s and a final extension step of 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products (4 µl) were diluted in 10 µl of 1 × TE buffer and mixed with 20 µl of formamide/size standard mixture (20 µl 500LIZ size standard per ml of formamide). The final mixture was denatured at 95 °C for 7 min and chilled to 4 °C for more than 2 min before analysis on an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Data were collected and analyzed by Genemapper Software version 3.7. All samples were measured in duplicate PCR reactions. The percent expression of each KIR gene was calculated as follows: KIR gene expression %      = The quantity of peak area for a KIR transcript The quantity of peak area for a CD 56 transcript Flow cytometric analysis of KIR phenotypes Peripheral blood was drawn in Vacutainer tubes containing trisodium citrate, citric acid and dextrose. The KIR phenotype was determined by using a six-color BD LSRII Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). Whole blood was incubated with the MoAbs, and red cells were then lysed with an ammonium chloride-based reagent (A no-wash system was used and there was no Ficoll gradient step). The MoAbs used were anti-CD45-FITC, anti-CD3-ECD (Phycoerythrin-Texas Red), anti-CD5-APC (allophycocyanin), anti-CD14-APC-Cy7-A, anti-CD158a,h-(EB6)-PE (Phycoerythrin), anti-CD158b-FITC (CH-L) and anti-NKB1-(DX9)-FITC. The collected data were analyzed using FACS DiVa software or FlowJo software. The live cell population was discriminated by using DAPI (Invitrogen). The CD14-negative population (equivalent to the lymphocyte population) was then selected and gated for the CD56-positive/CD3-negative population, which was then analyzed on the basis of KIR 2DL1/2DS1 (Clone EB6)-positive vs KIR 2DL2/3 (Clone CH-L)-negative; KIR3DL1 (Clone DX9)-negative; KIR3DL1 (Clone DX9)-positive vs KIR 2DL2/3/2DS2 (Clone GL 183)-negative; KIR 2DL1/2DS1 (Clone EB6)-negative; KIR 2DL2/3 (CH-L)-positive vs KIR 2DL1/2DS1 (Clone EB6)-negative; KIR 3DL1 (Clone DX9)-negative. Results were calculated as absolute cell numbers. Data were analyzed by using FACS DiVa or FlowJo software. Sequencing To examine the specificity of the KIR primers, we sequenced the PCR products generated by each pair of FW and RV primers. PCR product (50 µl) was purified by using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and was sequenced by using the Big Dye Terminator (v3.1) Chemistry on an ABI Prism 3730XL DNA analyzer. Statistical analyses Killer cell Ig-like receptor expression levels were compared by using the exact Wilcoxon Mann–Whitney U -test (SAS TWOSAMPL procedure, Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA). Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the frequency of KIR expression (FREQ procedure, SAS v9.1.3, SAS Institute Inc.). Spearman’s Rank-Order correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship between KIR expression levels and age (CORR procedure, SAS v9.1.3, SAS Institute Inc.). The statistical significance with a probability of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The false discover rate was estimated for the pooled P -values from all the tests implemented in the current study (MULTITEST procedure, SAS v9.1.5, SAS Institute Inc.). 15  Patients To establish a reference range, we examined KIR gene expression in 50 healthy sibling donors (16 F/34 M) matched to the patient age range (1–20 years).

The specific sequence was found in the PCR products of all primer sets. Each pair of KIR primers generated a specific PCR fragment with the distinct length shown on the electropherogram ( Figure 1 ). KIR repertoire distribution in healthy donors We determined the KIR gene expression in 87 healthy donors (50 were 1–20 years and 37 were 21–51 years of age). Their ranges of KIR gene expression are shown in Table 2 . As the KIR genotype distribution may affect their expression profiles, we excluded the null values of gene expression from the statistical comparison. The mean expression of five KIR families (2DL1, 2DL4, 2DS1, 3DS1, 3DL2) was significantly lower in the older than in the younger group. Three of those five KIR families were aKIR. The mean ratio of iKIR (2DL1, 2DL2, 2DL3, 2DL5, 3DL1 and 3DL2) to aKIR (2DL4, 2DS1, 2DS2, 2DS3, 2DS4, 2DS5 and 3DS1) was significantly higher in the older group than in the younger group ( P = 0.037). The overall KIR expression decreased as age increased ( Table 2 ). A statistically significant inverse correlation between age and expression was seen in 2DL4 and 3DS1. There was no statistically significant correlation between the PCR fragment length and KIR gene expression level in healthy donors ( P = 0.7), and no significant difference between male and female donors in mean KIR expression or mean iKIR/aKIR ratio. The false discover rate was 21% at the per-test significance level ? = 0.05. We observed 32 KIR expression profiles in the 87 healthy donors ( Figure 2 ). The 2DL1, 2DL2, 2DL3, 2DL4, 2DS2, 2DS4, 3DL1 and 3DL2 KIR families were expressed frequently ( Table 3 ). Four families (2DL5, 2DS3, 2DS5 and 3DS1) were less frequent in the older group, but only 3DS1 expression was significantly lower ( Table 3 ). Again, three of these four families were aKIR. The KIR RNAtype profiles of 18 healthy donors were qualitatively compared with their expression of three KIR phenotypes as determined by flow cytometry. We observed no qualitative difference between these phenotypes and the KIR gene expression profiles (data not shown). KIR repertoire distribution in pediatric patients before allogeneic HSCT We examined KIR repertoire in 37 pediatric patients before HSCT. We found lower expression of 11 of the 12 KIR families in those patients than in healthy donors of the same age range ( Figure 3 ). A statistically significant decrease was found in eight KIR families. Patients with ALL or non-Hodgkin’s lymphocyte were most affected, although the disease subgroups were too small to be compared statistically. The mean ratio of iKIR/aKIR was higher in the patient group but not significantly higher ( P = 0.25). Change in donor KIR expression after mobilization and selection of stem cells In the studies of 12 healthy donors, the majority of KIR families (2DL2, 2DL3, 2DL4, 2DS3, 2DS4, 2DS4, 3DL1, 3DS1 and 3DL2) showed increased expression ( P >0.05) after stem cell mobilization, but the iKIR/aKIR ratio did not change significantly. After stem cell selection, the expression of most KIR families returned to their pre-mobilization levels ( Figure 4 ).

After stem cell selection, the expression of most KIR families returned to their pre-mobilization levels ( Figure 4 ).  Discussion Here we have described a novel KIR RNAtype assay that we recently designed. By using this quantitative method, we were able to identify a trend toward lower KIR expression in adult donors than in younger donors and low overall KIR expression in pediatric leukemia patients before HSCT. The reverse transcription-PCR-based assay currently used to examine KIR gene expression is laborious and offers only a qualitative analysis. To avoid these drawbacks, we designed a set of KIR primers that includes 2 fluorescence-labeled common FW primers and 12 RV primers specific to each KIR family. With this design, each specific primer not only hybridizes to a specific KIR transcript, but also generates fluorescence-labeled PCR fragments of distinct length that are easily recognized and quantified by a DNA genetic analyzer. The PCR fragments were designed to be approximately 148–329 bp because a size range of 100–500 bp is most suitable for the assay. The two common FW primers simplified the PCR procedure and allowed us to further reduce the number of PCRs by generating mixed PCR products in which the distinct PCR fragment length is retained ( Figure 5 ). Confirmation of the specificity of our PCR primers and recognition of distinct fragment effectively reduced our likelihood of error. Ideally, a parallel comparison between the new assay and currently most used method would be made to show the advantage of this assay. We used CD56 transcript as an endogenous control for NK cell numbers that are subject to frequent change. About 10% of NK cells were reported to be of the CD56bright CD16dim/? subset, which has limited or negative KIR expression. 17 Theoretically, a change in the number of CD56+KIR? NK cells may affect the percentage of each KIR family in CD56 cells, but it would not alter the iKIR/aKIR ratio within KIR families and might cause no significant change in family representation. Further characterization of CD56+KIR? NK cells may reveal a better endogenous control. Another caveat is that although NK T cells compose only 1% of the peripheral blood NK cells, they can alter KIR expression. Our KIR RNAtyping assay does not distinguish those KIRs on NK T cells from the rest of the NK cells. Therefore, NK T cells must be isolated when the distinction is important. CD56 was the best-characterized available marker at the time of this study; however, other markers may be chosen when they are available. The distribution of KIR genotypes in the healthy population has been broadly studied and 37 KIR haplotypes have been described. 1 However, the KIR expression pattern in the healthy population has not been reported. This study identified 32 KIR expression patterns in 87 healthy donors, suggesting a wide variation in KIR expression. Consistent with reports of KIR genotypes, 1 2DL1, 2DL2, 2DL3, 2DL4, 2DS2, 2DS4, 3DL1 and 3DL2 were expressed frequently. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain information about the ethnic background of healthy donors in this study. The minor differences in frequency between our data and other reports may reflect disparities in the ethnic background and in the techniques used. Three aKIRs (2DS3, 2DS5 and 3DS1) were expressed less frequently in the adult donors than in younger donors. We also found an overall trend toward an inverse correlation between KIR gene expression and age that affected mainly the aKIR families. These findings suggest that aKIR expression declines quantitatively as well as qualitatively with age, although larger studies are needed for confirmation. Such a decline may delay activation of the NK killing function. Not surprisingly, the overall quantity of iKIR was higher than that of aKIR in the healthy donors, suggesting the dominance of the self-protective iKIR function. Sex hormones are unlikely to be involved in KIR expression, as we found no difference in KIR expression between female and male patients. Killer cell Ig-like receptor gene expression patterns have not been described earlier in leukemia patients. We found reduced expression of the majority of KIR families in leukemia patients before transplantation, especially in patients with ALL and non-Hodgkin’s lymphocyte. One possible explanation is the effect of chemotherapy. Some patients also showed an imbalance of iKIR and aKIR. In a preliminary analysis, we found a trend toward a substantially higher rate of relapse in patients with a higher iKIR/aKIR ratio before transplantation (data not shown). If iKIR excessively dominates aKIR, aKIR initiation of NK cell killing may be impeded, thereby increasing the risk of an adverse post transplant outcome. We observed the influence of stem cell mobilization and selection on KIR expression in the peripheral blood of 12 healthy donors. Expression of most KIR families increased after mobilization, although the iKIR/aKIR ratio did not change. As we used CD56 transcript as an endogenous control, it is unlikely that the increased KIR expression was an artifact caused by a greater number of NK cells. KIR expression subsequently returned to pre-mobilization levels. These findings indicate that G-CSF may transiently enhance donor KIR expression but does not affect the balance between iKIR and aKIR. In conclusion, KIR-RNAtyping offers a promising avenue for studies of KIR expression patterns that may guide HSCT treatment decisions. Our findings suggest that KIR expression differs quantitatively with age and during the disease and transplant process. Future studies should include a parallel comparison of the RNAtyping assay and the currently used method.  Discussion Here we have described a novel KIR RNAtype assay that we recently designed. By using this quantitative method, we were able to identify a trend toward lower KIR expression in adult donors than in younger donors and low overall KIR expression in pediatric leukemia patients before HSCT. The reverse transcription-PCR-based assay currently used to examine KIR gene expression is laborious and offers only a qualitative analysis. To avoid these drawbacks, we designed a set of KIR primers that includes 2 fluorescence-labeled common FW primers and 12 RV primers specific to each KIR family. With this design, each specific primer not only hybridizes to a specific KIR transcript, but also generates fluorescence-labeled PCR fragments of distinct length that are easily recognized and quantified by a DNA genetic analyzer. The PCR fragments were designed to be approximately 148–329 bp because a size range of 100–500 bp is most suitable for the assay. The two common FW primers simplified the PCR procedure and allowed us to further reduce the number of PCRs by generating mixed PCR products in which the distinct PCR fragment length is retained ( Figure 5 ). Confirmation of the specificity of our PCR primers and recognition of distinct fragment effectively reduced our likelihood of error. Ideally, a parallel comparison between the new assay and currently most used method would be made to show the advantage of this assay. We used CD56 transcript as an endogenous control for NK cell numbers that are subject to frequent change. About 10% of NK cells were reported to be of the CD56bright CD16dim/? subset, which has limited or negative KIR expression. 17 Theoretically, a change in the number of CD56+KIR? NK cells may affect the percentage of each KIR family in CD56 cells, but it would not alter the iKIR/aKIR ratio within KIR families and might cause no significant change in family representation. Further characterization of CD56+KIR? NK cells may reveal a better endogenous control. Another caveat is that although NK T cells compose only 1% of the peripheral blood NK cells, they can alter KIR expression. Our KIR RNAtyping assay does not distinguish those KIRs on NK T cells from the rest of the NK cells. Therefore, NK T cells must be isolated when the distinction is important. CD56 was the best-characterized available marker at the time of this study; however, other markers may be chosen when they are available. The distribution of KIR genotypes in the healthy population has been broadly studied and 37 KIR haplotypes have been described. 1 However, the KIR expression pattern in the healthy population has not been reported. This study identified 32 KIR expression patterns in 87 healthy donors, suggesting a wide variation in KIR expression.
