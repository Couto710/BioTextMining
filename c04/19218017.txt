Clinical Nihilism in Neuro-Emergencies Mortality and morbidity remain high from neurological emergencies such as acute stroke, traumatic brain injury, and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest. Decisions regarding initial aggressiveness of care must be made at the time of presentation and perceived prognosis is often used as part of this decision-making process. However, these decisions are predicated on the accuracy of early outcome prediction. Decisions to limit treatment early after neuro-emergencies must be balanced with avoidance of self-fulfilling prophecies of poor outcome due to clinical nihilism. This article examines the role of prognostication early after neuro-emergencies, the potential impact of early treatment limitations, and how these may relate to communication with patients and surrogate decision makers in the context of these acute neurological events.  Conclusions The acute management of patients with neuro-emergencies such as stroke, TBI, and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest is not a simple task. Only a small number of interventions have been clearly shown in randomized trials to be of benefit, yet decisions regarding optimal care have to be made in every patient and often for numerous issues. Many times the first decision faced by physicians in this context is whether to ‘engage’ by pursuing a trial of aggressive treatment or ‘retreat’ and initiate approaches to limit treatment based on perceived poor prognosis. A better appreciation of the imprecision of early prognostication and the potential deleterious effects of early treatment limitations has served to emphasize the challenge of decision-making at this early critical point. Yet, even in the absence of a treatment of proven benefit, nihilism is not an effective overall treatment strategy.
