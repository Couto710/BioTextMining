Current Perceptions of the Epidemiology of Atrial Fibrillation Synopsis Atrial fibrillation, an escalating dysrhythmia, is accountable for extensive population morbidity and mortality. In the United States, about 2.3 million people are presently diagnosed with AF and, it is estimated that this prevalence may increase to 5.6 million by 2050. Foremost predisposing risk factors for this dysrythmia include advanced age and cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. The chief hazard of atrial fibrillation is embolic stroke, which is increased 4–5 fold and in advanced age it becomes a dominant stroke risk factor. Atrial fibrillation also carries a doubled mortality rate.  Summary We are faced with a burgeoning epidemic of AF, which urgently demands improved prevention and treatment of this condition and its cardiovascular substrate. AF and the left atrial enlargement associated with it are likely direct causes of embolic stroke, requiring early detection and treatment. Targeted multivariable profile screening to detect persons who are likely candidates for AF is needed. Disappointing results of therapy to suppress or eliminate the rhythm disturbance have justifiably focused greater attention on preventive treatment. Many AF risk factors also predispose to cardiovascular diseases that beget its development. Treatment of modifiable risk factors specific for AF in high-risk candidates enables early intervention, when preventative or corrective measures are most effective. In the future identification of genetic and biologic markers for AF and its complications may provide pathophysiologic insights and improve risk stratification for more personalized and targeted therapy. Use of multivariable risk profiles to prevent a stroke, coronary disease, or cardiovascular disease in general should carry a bonus of prevention of AF. Therapies for predisposing factors using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers recommended for hypertensive cardiovascular disease, appear to reduce the rate of recurrence of AF after cardioversion and protect against development of AF in patients with LV dysfunction [ 81 ], [ 82 ], [ 83 ]. They also may inhibit the pro-inflammatory and sympathetic effects of angiotensin and interfere with the triggers and substrate of AF [ 9 ]. Warfarin anticoagulant therapy is highly effective for prevention of stroke in AF patients [ 26 ], [ 38 ]. Meta-analysis, according to the principle of intention to treat, shows that adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation is highly efficacious for primary and secondary and disabling stroke prevention with a risk reduction of 62% versus placebo [ 38 ]. Using “on-treatment analysis” the preventive efficacy of oral anticoagulation exceeds 80%. Despite this, a survey of treatment for patients having cerbrovascular disease indicates that only 50% are being treated to recommended standards of care. The deficits found in adherence to recommended processes for basic care for cardiovascular disease in general and AF in particular poses serious threats to the health of the population. Strategies to reduce these deficits in care are urgently needed.
