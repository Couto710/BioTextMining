Herbal preparations for uterine fibroids Background Uterine fibroids are the most common non-malignant growths in women of childbearing age. They are associated with heavy menstrual bleeding and subfertility. Herbal preparations are commonly used as alternatives to surgical procedures. Objectives To assess the benefits and risks of herbal preparations for uterine fibroids. Search strategy Authors searched following electronic databases: the Trials Registers of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Chinese Biomedical Database, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), AMED, and LILACS. The searches ended on 31st December 2008. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing herbal preparations with no intervention, placebo, medical treatment or surgical procedures in women with uterine fibroids. We also included trials of herbal preparations with or without conventional therapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors collected data independently. We assessed trial risk of bias according to our methodological criteria. We presented dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We included two randomised trials (involved 150 women) with clear description of randomisation methods. The methodological risk of bias of the trials varied. There were variations in the tested herbal preparations, and the treatment duration was six months. The outcomes available were not the primary outcomes selected for this review, such as symptom relief or the need for surgical treatment; trials mainly reported outcomes in terms of shrinkage of the fibroids. Compared with mifepristone, Huoxue Sanjie decoction showed no significant difference in the disappearance of uterine fibroids, number of patients with shrinking of uterine fibroids or average volume of uterine fibroids, but less effective than mifepristone on reducing average size of uterus (mean difference 23.23 cm3, 95% confidence interval 17.85 to 28.61). There was no significant difference between Nona Roguy herbal product and GnRH agonist in average volume of uterine fibroids or size of uterus. No serious adverse effects from herbal preparations was reported. Authors’ conclusions Current evidence does not support or refute the use of herbal preparations for treatment of uterine fibroids due to insufficient studies of large sample and high quality. Further high quality trials evaluating clinically relevant outcomes are warranted.  METHODS Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies Randomised controlled trials regardless of blinding, publication status, or language were included. We planned to include crossover randomised trials, but to use only data from the pre cross over period. We excluded quasi-randomised trials or randomised trials with false or unclear methods for random allocation of participants. Types of participants Women with uterine fibroids diagnosed by clinical symptoms and physical signs, and confirmed by ultrasound scanning, CT, MRI, or a combination of more than one of the procedures. We planned to include women with fibroid related symptoms and palpable uterine fibroids, without confirmation by imaging technology, and to compare these in sensitivity analyses. We also planned to include women without any symptoms who were found to have uterine fibroids during routine gynaecological examination and which were confirmed by imaging techniques. Types of interventions Experimental interventions included Chinese patent herbal medicine, other patent herbal products pertaining to different traditional medicines, extracts of a single herb or compound of herbs, or other individualised herbal remedies. The control interventions included no treatment, placebo, medical therapy, or surgical procedures. Types of outcome measures Primary outcomes Uterine fibroid related symptoms such as heavy, irregular, or prolonged menstrual periods; bleeding between the periods; pelvic or low back pain; and low abdominal pressure symptoms such as frequent or urgent urination, or constipation. Symptoms could be measured by either patient reporting or instrument, regardless of blinding. Number and size of the fibroids. Need for surgical treatment (myomectomy, hysterectomy, embolization) due to failure of medical prevention/management of the above symptoms. Secondary outcomes Complications such as anaemia, infertility, miscarriage, premature labour and delivery, abnormal fetal position. Quality of life (measured by validated scale or instrument). Uterine-volume reduction. Amount of bleeding. Adverse events. Search methods for identification of studies Electronic searches The following electronic databases were searched, irrespective of language and publication status. The Trials Registers of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3). The databases MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2008), EMBASE (1998 to Dec 2008), Chinese Biomedical Database (1979 to Dec 2008), Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), AMED, and LILACS ( www.bireme.br/bvs/I/ibd.htm ) from their date of inception onwards. We used the search terms: uterine fibroids, hysteromyoma, uterine leiomyomata, fibromyoma, myoma; and combined with traditional medicine, alternative medicine, plant extracts, medicinal plants, non-prescription drugs, herbs, complementary medicine, Chinese medicine, phytodrug or phytopharmaceutical. The detailed search strategy is listed Table 1 . Searching other resources We checked the reference lists of identified randomised controlled trials and review articles in order to find further trials not identified by the electronic searches. We searched for ongoing trials through the National Research Register and the web site www.controlled-trials.com . We also checked ’grey’ literature including unpublished conference proceedings or abstract books, and contacted pharmaceutical companies which produce herbal medicines for uterine fibroids, to identify unpublished trials. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies Two authors (Jianping Liu and Hong Yang) independently selected the trials to be included in the review according to the prespecified selection criteria. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. Yun Xia confirmed the randomisation through phone call to Chinese trialist’s. Data extraction and management Two authors (JP Liu and H Yang) independently extracted data using a self-developed data extraction form. Papers not in Chinese, English, Japanese, or Italian were translated with the help of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorder and Subfertility Group. We extracted the following characteristics and data from each included trial: primary author, study setting, methodology, age, gender, and ethnicity of participants, number of participants randomised and analysed, participant inclusion and exclusion criteria, symptoms and methods for measurement, the diagnostic criteria, type of herb or herbs, quality of the products, route of delivery, dosage and duration of intervention, details of the comparison regime, duration of follow up, reasons for and number dropped out or lost during follow up, outcome measures (end of treatment and at follow up), and number and type of adverse events. We sought data on the number of participants with each outcome, by allocated treatment group, irrespective of compliance or follow up to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Two authors (JP Liu and H Yang) independently assessed methodological risk of bias based on quality components, i.e. adequacy of the generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, double blinding, and follow up ( Jadad 1996 ; Kjaergard 2001 ; Moher 1998 ; Schulz 1995 ). Any disagreement was discussed and consensus reached through a third party (F Cardini). See also Figure 1 ; Figure 2 . Generation of the allocation sequence Adequate if the allocation sequence was generated by a computer or random number table. Drawing of lots, tossing of a coin, shuffling of cards, or throwing dice may also be considered as adequate if a person who was not otherwise involved in the recruitment of participants performed the procedure; Unclear if the trial was described as randomised but the method used for the allocation sequence generation was not described; Inadequate if a system involving dates, names, or admittance numbers was used for the allocation of participants (i.e. quasi-randomisation). Allocation concealment Adequate if the allocation of participants involved a central independent unit, on-site locked computer, identically appearing numbered drug bottles or containers prepared by an independent pharmacist or investigator, or sealed envelopes. Envelopes should be serially numbered, sealed, and opaque. However, this information is rarely provided, indicating an increased risk of bias. In that case, sealed envelopes may constitute an intermediate category between adequate and unclear; Unclear if the trial was described as randomised but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described; Inadequate if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants, or if the study was quasi-randomised. Blinding (or masks) Double blinding if the trial was described as double blind and both the participant and physician were blinded, or participant and outcome assessor; Single blinding if the participants, or physicians, or outcome assessors were blinded; Open-label if blinding was not applied. Follow up Adequate if the numbers and reasons for withdrawals or losses to follow up from the trial in all intervention groups were described or if it was specified that there were no withdrawals or losses to follow up; Unclear if the report gave the impression that there had been no withdrawals or losses to follow up but this was not specifically stated; Inadequate if the number of, or reasons for, withdrawals or losses to follow up were not described. Measures of treatment effect We presented dichotomous data as risk ratio (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We performed analyses by intention-to-treat where possible. For dichotomous outcomes, participants with incomplete or missing data were to be included in a sensitivity analysis by counting them as treatment failures to explore the possible effect of loss to follow up on the findings (’worst-case’ scenario). Unit of analysis issues For continuous data, we took ’carry forward’ to use last observed patient data in analysis. Dealing with missing data For missing data or inadequately reported data, we contacted the trial investigators for clarification. Assessment of heterogeneity Due to limited number of trials included, we were not able to do the test for heterogeneity. Assessment of reporting biases Due to limited number of trials included, we were not able to assess reporting bias. Data synthesis We compared every type of herbal medicine individually with each control (e.g. medical therapy) regardless of route of administration, dose, or preparation. We planned to combine data from individual trials for meta-analysis when the interventions were sufficiently similar (i.e. individual trials compared the same herb versus the same control), and when participants were similar, such as symptomatic or not, or seeking fertility treatment or not. For three-arm trials, the data from the control group would be split in half, so that half of the participants and half of the events would be used in each comparison. We tabulated the following comparisons where data were available: herbal medicine versus no treatment, herbal medicine versus placebo, herbal medicine versus pharmacological treatment, and herbal medicines versus surgical procedure. We presented trials of herbal medicines plus conventional therapy versus conventional therapy alone as a separate comparison. If a sufficient number of randomised trials were identified, and data were available, we would have performed subgroup analyses according to symptom (presence or absence), and location of uterine fibroids (submucosal, intramural, or subserosal fibroids). Furthermore, if a sufficient number of randomised trials were identified for the same interventions, we planned to perform sensitivity analyses to explore the influence of trial quality or diagnosis, with or without imaging confirmation, on effect estimates. The quality components would include adequacy of generation of allocation sequence, concealment of allocation, blinding, and the use of intention-to-treat (yes or no). Potential biases ( Vickers 1998 ) would be investigated using the funnel plot or other corrective analytical methods ( Egger 1997 ). We intend to complete an update the review every 24 months. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity Heterogeneity was tested by using the Chi2 test, with significance being set at a P value of less than 0.10 and the I2 greater than 50% being considered as substantial heterogeneity. Whenever there was significant heterogeneity we used a random-effects model and investigated heterogeneity in both clinical characteristics and methodological differences between studies. We carried out the analyses in Review Manager 5.0 (RevMan 2008). Sensitivity analysis The number of trials did not allow us to perform meaningful sensitivity analysis.

RESULTS Description of studies See: Characteristics of included studies ; Characteristics of excluded studies . Our initial electronic searches identified 852 citations, with a further 35 from additional handsearches. After reading titles and abstracts we excluded 768 of these because they were either :duplicates, non-clinical studies, review articles, case reports, case series, or had study objectives different from this review. A total of 119 references published in Chinese or in English were retrieved for further assessment. We excluded 94 of these studies because they did not meet our inclusion criteria. We contacted with the trial authors to confirm the randomisation methods and missing data, and this procedure allowed us to excluded 21 claimed ’randomised’ trials by phone calls. Results of the search Our initial electronic searches identified 852 citations, with a further 35 from additional handsearches. Included studies We were able to include 2 randomised controlled trials in this review ( Hazlina 2005 ; Lu JX 2007 ). These RCTs reported random allocation of participants with uterine fibroids to herbal medicines or mifepristone, or GnRH agonist. The 2 randomised trials are listed in the table of ’ Characteristics of included studies ’. One trial was published in Chinese, and the other in English. Outcomes Neither trial reported need for surgical treatment, quality of life, fertility, participant compliance, or cost-effectiveness. Outcomes were reported as disappearance of uterine fibroids, volume of fibroids or size of uterus, and adverse effect. The two trials reported follow up after the completion of treatment, ranging from 3 to 6 months. Neither trial assessed acceptability and satisfaction of using herbal preparations. Participants A total of 150 women with uterine fibroids were randomised. One trial was conducted in China and one trial in Malaysia. The two trials included childbearing-age women with uterine fibroids, diagnosed through routine gynaecological examination and confirmed by type B ultrasound. The two trials reported baseline comparability between groups. As the number of trials included was limited, we could not perform prespecified subgroup analyses, such as symptom type or location of fibroids. Interventions Two herbal preparations were tested in the two trials (see Table 2 ). The controls were pharmaceutical medicines including mifepristone and GnRH agonist. The treatment duration was six months. Excluded studies The reasons for exclusion are listed in the table of ’ Characteristics of excluded studies ’. Risk of bias in included studies The two included trials were reported as parallel group, randomised trials. Neither was a multicentre trial (see Characteristics of included studies ). One trial, published in English, reported the randomisation method and adequate allocation concealment ( Hazlina 2005 ), and was considered to have a low risk of bias. Another trial published in Chinese reported the method for generation of allocation randomisation, but provided no information on allocation concealment or blinding. Our contact with trial authors by phone resulted in our exclusion of 21 randomised trials that originally planned to include (see Characteristics of excluded studies ). We were not able to perform meaningful sensitivity or study publication analysis bias due to the limited number of trials. Effects of interventions Herbal medicine versus medical treatment Two trials compared herbal medicines versus conventional drug treatment. Since there was no trial testing the same herbal medicine and control for the same outcome twice, a meta-analysis was not possible for the reported outcomes. Disappearance of uterine fibroids Compared with mifepristone, herbal preparation Huoxue Sanjie decoction showed no significant difference in the effect on the disappearance of the fibroids ( Lu JX 2007 ). Shrinkage of uterine fibroids or uterus There was no significant difference between Huoxue Sanjie decoction and mifepristone in either the number of patients with shrank uterine fibroids or average volume of uterine fibroids (mean difference 4.98 cm3, 95% CI ?6.08 to 16.04) ( Lu JX 2007 ) see Table 3 . However, Huoxue Sanjie decoction was less effective than mifepristone for the average size of uterine fibroids. The comparisons and effect estimates are presented in Table 4 . There was no significant difference between the herbal preparation Nona Roguy and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist regarding uterus size (MD ?23.61 cm3, 95% CI ?223.63 to 176.41) ( Hazlina 2005 ). Adverse effects Two trials reported outcome of adverse effects (see Table 5 ) and one trial reported one case of discomfort stomach ( Lu JX 2007 ). No serious adverse effects from taking herbal preparations were reported.  RESULTS Description of studies See: Characteristics of included studies ; Characteristics of excluded studies .

Outcomes were reported as disappearance of uterine fibroids, volume of fibroids or size of uterus, and adverse effect. The two trials reported follow up after the completion of treatment, ranging from 3 to 6 months. Neither trial assessed acceptability and satisfaction of using herbal preparations. Participants A total of 150 women with uterine fibroids were randomised. One trial was conducted in China and one trial in Malaysia. The two trials included childbearing-age women with uterine fibroids, diagnosed through routine gynaecological examination and confirmed by type B ultrasound.

DISCUSSION Summary of main results This systematic review included only two randomised trials on herbal preparations for the treatment of uterine fibroids. One trial with good quality was published in English ( Hazlina 2005 ) and one trial published in Chinese was of low quality ( Lu JX 2007 ). The trials in this review showed a similar effect of herbal preparations with medication in terms of shrinkage or disappearance of uterine fibroids. However, due to the small sample of the trials and methodological flaws in one trial, any indicated benefit is not conclusive. Further large and rigorous trials are needed. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence The included studies tested two different herbal medicines with conventional therapy including mifepristone or GnRHa. There was no significant difference between herbs and medical treatment. However, lack of statistical significant difference does not mean equal effect as none of the trials were designed as equivalence and the sample size was no more than 100 in each arm. With regard to the conventional medical treatments used in the included studies, the efficacy of mifepristone for uterine fibroids has not been firmly established. A systematic review only identified six before and after clinical trials without placebo or double blinding ( Fiscella 2006 ; Steinauer 2004 ). The evidence from this review is not sufficiently convincing to support a clinical recommendation due to the following aspects of the trials. There is a lack of evidence comparing the efficacy of individual herbal preparation with placebo for uterine fibroids. Comparisons with placebo are needed, as there is no clear evidence of efficacy of the comparators used in the trials. Although Chinese herb Huoxue Sanjie decoction showed promising effect compared with mifepristone, the findings are not confirmed as we still lack established efficacy of mifepristone for treatment of uterine fibroids. The trials reported outcomes by end of treatment or short-term follow up. For those women with asymptomatic or mild symptom fibroids, the use of herbal therapies is intended to prevent fibroid growth, or to manage of mild symptoms. For this (wide) subgroup of patients the main outcome is the avoidance of surgical treatment, measured through long-term follow up. Future trialist’s are encouraged to adopt this outcome, as women may simply reach their menopause without needing surgery. In addition, reproductive outcomes related to uterine fibroids, such as the relationship between submucosal, intramural, or subserosal fibroids and pregnancy rates, miscarriage, and malpresentation should be addressed in future trials ( Klatsky 2008 ) Quality of the evidence This systematic review has several methodological limitations. Firstly, there are lack of high quality trials and we have to exclude some of the trials that claimed to be randomised because of an unexplainable skew in the distribution of participants among the compared groups or unclear randomisation, which means they are highly prone to selection bias. Secondly, trials did not reporting use of double blinding, which may be related to performance and detection bias ( Schulz 1995 ; Moher 1998 ). Thirdly, the trials had a small sample size. Although some data analyses did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between herbal medicines and conventional medicine, the results are likely to have been underpowered. Therefore, the size of the trials may mean that the analyses may not establish with confidence that the two interventions have equivalent effects. The above limitations mean that potential bias may have been present in the selection of participants, administration of treatment, and assessment of outcomes in the primary studies. Methodologically less rigorous trials show significantly larger intervention effects than more robust trials ( Egger 2003 ; Kjaergard 2001 ; Moher 1998 ; Schulz 1995 ). An empirical study has shown that Chinese trials are significantly affected by publication bias ( Vickers 1998 ). When interpreting the present findings, publication bias should be taken into consideration accordingly. In summary, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample sizes, low methodological quality in one of the two trials, and the limited number of trials included. Potential biases in the review process The use of herbal medicines for uterine fibroids may not be warranted unless we have firm evidence of their efficacy and safety. In future clinical trials both the beneficial and harmful effects should be paid equal attention, and the recording and reporting of adverse effects should be improved. In this systematic review, quality of herbal medicines was not reported in details, and for future trials, it is important to investigate herbal medicines according to a set of criteria which include preparation consistent with the description in the pharmacopoeia, chemical standardisation, biological assays, animal models, and clinical testing ( Yuan 2000 ). It will be necessary to improve the description of the herbal medicines being tested, for example, plant species, geographical origin, harvest season, preparation procedures, and the quality of the products.

In future clinical trials both the beneficial and harmful effects should be paid equal attention, and the recording and reporting of adverse effects should be improved. In this systematic review, quality of herbal medicines was not reported in details, and for future trials, it is important to investigate herbal medicines according to a set of criteria which include preparation consistent with the description in the pharmacopoeia, chemical standardisation, biological assays, animal models, and clinical testing ( Yuan 2000 ). It will be necessary to improve the description of the herbal medicines being tested, for example, plant species, geographical origin, harvest season, preparation procedures, and the quality of the products.  Summary of main results This systematic review included only two randomised trials on herbal preparations for the treatment of uterine fibroids. One trial with good quality was published in English ( Hazlina 2005 ) and one trial published in Chinese was of low quality ( Lu JX 2007 ). The trials in this review showed a similar effect of herbal preparations with medication in terms of shrinkage or disappearance of uterine fibroids. However, due to the small sample of the trials and methodological flaws in one trial, any indicated benefit is not conclusive. Further large and rigorous trials are needed.

However, due to the small sample of the trials and methodological flaws in one trial, any indicated benefit is not conclusive. Further large and rigorous trials are needed.  Overall completeness and applicability of evidence The included studies tested two different herbal medicines with conventional therapy including mifepristone or GnRHa. There was no significant difference between herbs and medical treatment. However, lack of statistical significant difference does not mean equal effect as none of the trials were designed as equivalence and the sample size was no more than 100 in each arm. With regard to the conventional medical treatments used in the included studies, the efficacy of mifepristone for uterine fibroids has not been firmly established. A systematic review only identified six before and after clinical trials without placebo or double blinding ( Fiscella 2006 ; Steinauer 2004 ). The evidence from this review is not sufficiently convincing to support a clinical recommendation due to the following aspects of the trials. There is a lack of evidence comparing the efficacy of individual herbal preparation with placebo for uterine fibroids. Comparisons with placebo are needed, as there is no clear evidence of efficacy of the comparators used in the trials. Although Chinese herb Huoxue Sanjie decoction showed promising effect compared with mifepristone, the findings are not confirmed as we still lack established efficacy of mifepristone for treatment of uterine fibroids. The trials reported outcomes by end of treatment or short-term follow up. For those women with asymptomatic or mild symptom fibroids, the use of herbal therapies is intended to prevent fibroid growth, or to manage of mild symptoms. For this (wide) subgroup of patients the main outcome is the avoidance of surgical treatment, measured through long-term follow up. Future trialist’s are encouraged to adopt this outcome, as women may simply reach their menopause without needing surgery. In addition, reproductive outcomes related to uterine fibroids, such as the relationship between submucosal, intramural, or subserosal fibroids and pregnancy rates, miscarriage, and malpresentation should be addressed in future trials ( Klatsky 2008 )  Overall completeness and applicability of evidence The included studies tested two different herbal medicines with conventional therapy including mifepristone or GnRHa.

Firstly, there are lack of high quality trials and we have to exclude some of the trials that claimed to be randomised because of an unexplainable skew in the distribution of participants among the compared groups or unclear randomisation, which means they are highly prone to selection bias. Secondly, trials did not reporting use of double blinding, which may be related to performance and detection bias ( Schulz 1995 ; Moher 1998 ). Thirdly, the trials had a small sample size. Although some data analyses did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between herbal medicines and conventional medicine, the results are likely to have been underpowered. Therefore, the size of the trials may mean that the analyses may not establish with confidence that the two interventions have equivalent effects. The above limitations mean that potential bias may have been present in the selection of participants, administration of treatment, and assessment of outcomes in the primary studies. Methodologically less rigorous trials show significantly larger intervention effects than more robust trials ( Egger 2003 ; Kjaergard 2001 ; Moher 1998 ; Schulz 1995 ). An empirical study has shown that Chinese trials are significantly affected by publication bias ( Vickers 1998 ). When interpreting the present findings, publication bias should be taken into consideration accordingly. In summary, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample sizes, low methodological quality in one of the two trials, and the limited number of trials included.

AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS Implications for practice Current evidence does not support the use of herbal preparations for treatment of uterine fibroids. There is no conclusive evidence of benefit due to limited number of trials conducted, the methodological quality of the primary studies and their insufficient power to meet robust conclusions. Implications for research Further well-designed, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed to evaluate herbal preparations in uterine fibroids. To improve quality, trials needs to use appropriate allocation concealment, blinding of participants, researchers and outcome assessors, and clarify the number of participants randomised and the number analysed. Clinically relevant outcomes, such as symptoms, infertility, and anaemia, should be addressed and measured using validated patient-reported instruments. Potentially promising herbal preparations require further trials with large samples. Trial reports should follow international standards, such as the CONSORT Statement ( http://www.consort-statement.org/ ). PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Herbal preparations for the treatment of women with uterine fibroids Uterine fibroids are benign (non cancerous) growths in the uterus. They are the most common type of growth found in a women’s pelvis, being present in about one in four or five women older than 35 years. Although many women with fibroids are not aware of them, the growths may cause symptoms or problems due to their size, number, or location. Common symptoms can include longer or more frequent menstrual periods, heavy bleeding, menstrual pain, pressure in the lower abdomen, infertility, or miscarriages. Women with these symptoms will require treatment. Fibroids can be treated with surgery, such as myomectomy (removal of the fibroids while leaving the uterus in place) or hysterectomy (removal of the uterus). Another approach is uterine artery embolization, by which the blood vessels to the uterus are blocked. Drugs, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, may be used to shrink fibroids and to control bleeding. Herbal preparations are commonly used alternatives for drug treatment, surgery, or both. This systematic review included two randomised clinical trials involving 150 women with uterine fibroids. Compared with medication, two herbal preparations may have similar beneficial effect on the shrinkage of uterine fibroids or uterus. However, these clinical trials are small in terms of the number of participants and the trial quality varied. The effect of herbal preparations for uterine fibroids therefore needs to be studied in further large, good quality trials.
