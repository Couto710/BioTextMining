STAT4 Associates with SLE Through Two Independent Effects that Correlate with Gene Expression and Act Additively with IRF5 to Increase Risk Objectives To confirm and define the genetic association of STAT4 and systemic lupus erythematosus, investigate the possibility of correlations with differential splicing and/or expression levels, and genetic interaction with IRF5. Methods 30 tag SNPs were genotyped in an independent set of Spanish cases and controls. SNPs surviving correction for multiple tests were genotyped in 5 new sets of cases and controls for replication. STAT4 cDNA was analyzed by 5’-RACE PCR and sequencing. Expression levels were measured by quantitative PCR. Results In the fine-mapping, four SNPs were significant after correction for multiple testing, with rs3821236 and rs3024866 as the strongest signals, followed by the previously associated rs7574865, and by rs1467199. Association was replicated in all cohorts. After conditional regression analyses, two major independent signals represented by SNPs rs3821236 and rs7574865, remained significant across the sets. These SNPs belong to separate haplotype blocks. High levels of STAT4 expression correlated with SNPs rs3821236, rs3024866 (both in the same haplotype block) and rs7574865 but not with other SNPs. We also detected transcription of alternative tissue-specific exons 1, indicating presence of tissue-specific promoters of potential importance in the expression of STAT4 . No interaction with associated SNPs of IRF5 was observed using regression analysis. Conclusions These data confirm STAT4 as a susceptibility gene for SLE and suggest the presence of at least two functional variants affecting levels of STAT4 . Our results also indicate that both genes STAT4 and IRF5 act additively to increase risk for SLE.  Material and Methods Patients and controls In total, 1581 cases and 1844 controls were used in this study, all with complete data for the SNPs analyzed: 390 cases and 620 controls from Spain, 247 cases and 220 controls from Germany, 221 patients and 207 controls from Italy, 171 patients and 171 controls from Argentina, and 231 cases and 250 controls from Mexico (adults) along with a set of 321 pediatric patients and 383 adult controls. The patient and control sets studied here have been described previously [ 10 , 14 ]. All patients fulfilled the 1982 ACR criteria for classification of SLE. Selection of Tag SNPs 29 Tag SNPs covering the STAT1 and STAT4 genes, and the intergenic region, were selected using Haploview version 3.32 from the HapMap-CEU population genotype data. Aggressive tagging mode was used to select tag SNPs with a minor allele frequency ?5%, with an r2 threshold ?0.8. Rs7574865 was added to the tag list after being reported as associated with RA [ 11 ]. SNPs associated in the Spanish fine-mapping, after quality control and correction for multiple testing, were typed in the German, Italian, Argentinean, and both Mexican sets. Genotyping Spanish samples were genotyped in Granada using TaqMan® 5’ exonuclease assay (ABI, Foster City, CA). German, Italian, and Latin American samples were genotyped at Uppsala University. Mexican pediatric samples were genotyped at Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica using the same method. Genotyping consistency between the centers was established to be near to 100% [ 15 ]. Statistical Analyses The Spanish genotype data was processed using Haploview version 4.0 [ 16 ], PLINK version 1.02 [ 17 ], and R language. Quality control filters were applied to remove SNPs with >10% missing data in cases or controls (1 SNP excluded), deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 0.001, 2 SNPs excluded), or minor allele frequency <5% in controls (2 SNPs excluded). 25 SNPs remained. Subjects with an individual missing genotyping rate >10% were also removed (n=42). Genotyping rate in remaining individuals was 97.4%. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) measures ( D’ and r 2 ) between SNPs and maximum-likelihood haplotype frequencies were estimated with the EM algorithm. Multiple testing was corrected by Bonferroni and false discovery rate (FDR) methods [ 18 ]. Statistical analysis of the replication sets included only subjects with 100% individual genotyping calls. DerSimonian-Laird and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel methods implemented in StatsDirect and PLINK were used to estimate the pooled odds ratio for all populations assuming random and fixed effects models on the allelic association, respectively. These were adjusted by adding the stratification variable “Population” to the logistic regression model containing the genotype as the exposure variable. This test is identical to the 1 degree of freedom Mantel-Haenszel test of the hypothesis that the stratum specific odds ratios are 1 [ 19 ]. The heterogeneity test based on partitioning the chi-square statistic implemented in PLINK, was used to test between-population differences. Univariate genotypic odds ratios were estimated by logistic regression [ 20 ]. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine independency of the SNPs from rs7574865. All logistic regression analyses were done with R. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate if additive or interaction effects were present between SNPs within STAT4 and IRF5 . To measure the ability to discriminate between SLE cases and controls, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (C-statistic) was calculated. To statistically compare the C-statistics we applied the method by DeLong et al. [ 21 ] 5’-RACE and 3’-RACE PCR Marathon-Ready cDNA from different tissues (Clontech) was used as template for amplification of tissue-specific 5’- and 3’-UTRs. The following pairs of nested gene-specific primers were used for 5’-RACE PCR: 5’-GAAATTCTACTGAGAGACTCCCATTG-3’ and 5’-GAATCGTTGCCATGGTTTCATTGTTAG-3’ and for 3’-RACE PCR: 5’-CTAAACTATCAGGTAAAGGTTAAGGCATC-3’ and 5’-GGTAAACACTACAGCTCTCAGCCTTG-3’. Adapter primers Ap1 and Ap2 were provided with cDNA. Nested PCR was carried out using 1/30 of the first round PCR products. 35 cycles of PCR (95°C for 20 s, 60°C for 15 s and 72°C for 3 min) were performed after initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min in buffer containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 ?M of each of dNTPs, 0.4 ?M of each of the corresponding primers, and 0.5 U of Platinum Taq high fidelity enzyme (Invitrogen). PCR products were analysed by sequencing. RNA purification and STAT4 expression analysis Total RNA was purified as described elsewhere [ 10 ] from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained with agreed consent from 73 healthy volunteers. 2 ?g of RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo-dT primers according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Applied Biosystems). STAT4 expression was determined by real-time PCR using SYBR Green detection. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 5 min, 45 cycles of PCR (95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 10 s and 72°C for 20 s). ?-isoform was detected with the following primers: forward 5’-CATCTCAACAATCCGAAGTGATTCA-3’ and common reverse primer 5’-GTCAGAGTTTATCCTGTCATTCAGCAG-3’. ?-isoform-specific forward primer was 5’-TGACCTTGTTATCTCTTTAAGCCGA-3’. Expression levels were normalized against TATA-binding protein (TBP) gene expression amplified with commercial reagents (Applied Biosystems). All experiments were run in triplicate. Statistical analysis of gene expression ANOVA and F-test were used to determine the difference in the mRNA expression level in relation to each of the SNPs, taking the three possible genotypes as factor levels. Significance of gene expression was also tested with linear regression using ?T values as a continuous trait and WHAP for regression with individual SNP alleles [ 22 ].  Patients and controls In total, 1581 cases and 1844 controls were used in this study, all with complete data for the SNPs analyzed: 390 cases and 620 controls from Spain, 247 cases and 220 controls from Germany, 221 patients and 207 controls from Italy, 171 patients and 171 controls from Argentina, and 231 cases and 250 controls from Mexico (adults) along with a set of 321 pediatric patients and 383 adult controls.

STAT4 expression was determined by real-time PCR using SYBR Green detection.

Expression levels were normalized against TATA-binding protein (TBP) gene expression amplified with commercial reagents (Applied Biosystems). All experiments were run in triplicate.  Statistical analysis of gene expression ANOVA and F-test were used to determine the difference in the mRNA expression level in relation to each of the SNPs, taking the three possible genotypes as factor levels. Significance of gene expression was also tested with linear regression using ?T values as a continuous trait and WHAP for regression with individual SNP alleles [ 22 ].  Statistical analysis of the Interaction with <italic>IRF5</italic> IRF5 was found as a well-established non-MHC association with SLE. To study if the effect of STAT4 was independent of IRF5 , or if there were epistatic effects between SNPs in these genes we performed multiple logistic regression analysis and c-statistic including the genotype data for 3 SNPs of IRF5 (rs2004640, rs2070197, and rs10954213) from our previous studies [ 5 , 14 ], The analyses revealed no significant interaction effects between STAT4 and IRF5 SNPs, but close to complete independent effects on SLE risk as shown by a slight change in estimates when combined in a multivariate model (data not shown). The three SNPs of IRF5 had c-statistics of 0.587 0.585 and 0.565, respectively ( Supplementary Table 5 ). Rs2070197 tags the major risk haplotype and has the highest predictive ability [ 14 ]. Addition of rs7574865 to the IRF5 SNPs increased the predictive value of the models significantly (rs7574865 with rs2004640: c-statistic=0.632, P=1.66×10 -5 ; rs7574865 with rs2070197: C-statistic = 0.636, P=3.28×10 -11 and rs7574865 with rs10954213: C-statistic=0.624, P=9.62×10 -7 ). The results support an additive effect of SNPs of both genes, particularly rs7574865 and rs2070197 to increase risk for SLE ( Figure 2 ).  Tissue-specific alternative transcripts of <italic>STAT4</italic> In order to investigate if differential splicing could be related to the genetic association of STAT4 , functional annotation of gene transcripts expressed in different tissues was performed. Until now, two isoforms have been described for STAT4 , ? and ? [ 23 ]. Only the known ? and ? isoforms were detected when we tested spleen testis, kidney, lung, pancreas, intestine and uterus for new isoforms. Since 5’- and 3’-UTRs may substantially affect gene expression [ 14 ], we performed detailed analysis of non-coding 5’-exons and 3’-UTRs. The pattern of 5’UTRs was diverse in different tissues ( Table 3 ), but all of them lead to the known isoforms of STAT4 .  Analysis of <italic>STAT4</italic> expression levels Levels of STAT4 gene expression in human mononuclear cells were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Since expression of ? transcript was much lower than of the ? transcript and its expression followed the trend of the ?-transcript in all samples, it was excluded from the analysis. By using ANOVA to test if differences in gene expression correlated with genotypes, we found a modest up regulation of STAT4 mRNA and the CC risk genotype of rs3024866 (p = 0.0371). By regression analysis, risk alleles of SNPs rs3821236 and rs7574865 correlated with higher STAT4 expression. Importantly, SNP rs1467199 did not correlate with STAT4 expression ( Figure 3 ).  Results Association was detected for several SNPs across STAT4 and the STAT1-STAT4 intergenic region, with the strongest association with rs3821236 (p=7.07×10-8), followed by rs3024866 (p=3.83×10-7), rs7574865 (p=9.37×10-6) and rs1467199 (p=7×10-5), all of which remained significant after correction for multiple tests ( Table 1 ). The region LD structure defined six haplotype blocks, two located in STAT1 (blocks 1-2), one in the intergenic region (block 3) and three in STAT4 (blocks 4-6) ( Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1 ). Our results indicate association of two additional haplotype blocks than that containing rs7574865 (block 6): block 3, which contains rs1467199, and block 4 harboring rs3821236 and rs3024866 ( Figure 1 ). To replicate the genetic associations and increase statistical power, we genotyped the associated SNPs in 5 independent sets from Italy, Germany, Argentina, and Mexico (one adult and one pediatric set). Homogeneity test showed combinability of the odds ratios for the SNPs except rs3024866 and rs7574865 that had some heterogeneity across the strata. None of the SNPs provided association with the German population except for a borderline association with rs7574865 ( Tables 2 and Supplementary Table 1 ). The Mexican pediatric set showed association only with rs1467199 (p=0.008, Supplementary Table 2 ). Despite heterogeneity (p=0.01) the German set was included in the meta-analysis. The Mexican pediatric set was not included due to lack of statistical combinability (compare Supplementary Table 2 with Table 2 ). In the meta-analysis, SNPs rs3821236 (p=5.96×10-20) and rs7574865 (p=4.44×10-23) showed the strongest association across all strata in the allelic and genotypic tests, but rs3024866 was also associated (p=2.31×10-12) ( Table 2 ). Although rs1467199 reaches significant association in the meta-analysis, at the individual population level it was only replicated in the Argentine set (rs1467199-CG p=1.63×10-2, rs1467199-GG p=0.053) ( Supplementary Table 1 ). We tested whether the associated SNPs constituted independent effects. Rs7574865 is not in strong LD with rs3024866 (R2=0.29) or rs3821236 (R2=0.42), which are located 62 kb and 42 kb from rs7574865, respectively, and therefore they are not proxies. Rs1467199 has R2=0.30 with rs3821236, R2=0.18 with rs3024866 and R2=0.13 with rs7574865 ( Figure 1 ). The low pairwise correlation coefficients (R2) suggest that the individual SNP associations reflect independent effects, except for rs3024866, which has relatively high R2 with rs3821236 (R2=0.64) ( Figure1 ). This was confirmed by conditional logistic regression analysis: rs3821236 remained significant when conditioning on rs7574865, and vice versa ( Supplementary Table 3 ). Thus, rs3821236 and rs7574865 represent two independent genetic effects within STAT4 . rs3821236 is located in intron 16th, ~60 kb downstream from the 3rd intron where the association has been confined in previous studies [ 11 ]. SNPs rs3821236 and rs3024866 are tagging a 26kb haplotype block (block 4) covering part of the gene between intron 8 to 16 ( Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1 ) that contain 3 of the 6 markers associated with SLE in the Spanish fine-mapping after multiple test correction ( Table 1 ). After conditional haplotype-based association test the haplotype block 4 (SNPs rs3821236-rs932169) remain significant (p=0.002277) after controlling for rs7574865 confirming its independency. Using the ROC curve and c-statistic, we observed that rs7574865 was a somewhat better risk predictor (c=0.590) than rs3821236 (c=0.577), but the difference did not reach statistical significance ( Supplementary Table 4 ). Thus, each SNP alone provides the same level of prediction for risk for SLE, independently. Statistical analysis of the Interaction with <italic>IRF5</italic> IRF5 was found as a well-established non-MHC association with SLE. To study if the effect of STAT4 was independent of IRF5 , or if there were epistatic effects between SNPs in these genes we performed multiple logistic regression analysis and c-statistic including the genotype data for 3 SNPs of IRF5 (rs2004640, rs2070197, and rs10954213) from our previous studies [ 5 , 14 ], The analyses revealed no significant interaction effects between STAT4 and IRF5 SNPs, but close to complete independent effects on SLE risk as shown by a slight change in estimates when combined in a multivariate model (data not shown).

Although rs1467199 reaches significant association in the meta-analysis, at the individual population level it was only replicated in the Argentine set (rs1467199-CG p=1.63×10-2, rs1467199-GG p=0.053) ( Supplementary Table 1 ). We tested whether the associated SNPs constituted independent effects. Rs7574865 is not in strong LD with rs3024866 (R2=0.29) or rs3821236 (R2=0.42), which are located 62 kb and 42 kb from rs7574865, respectively, and therefore they are not proxies.

By regression analysis, risk alleles of SNPs rs3821236 and rs7574865 correlated with higher STAT4 expression. Importantly, SNP rs1467199 did not correlate with STAT4 expression ( Figure 3 ).  Discussion We confirmed the genetic association between STAT4 and SLE and through a fine-mapping effort we identified a second effect independent of rs7574865 located in the vicinity of intron 16. The publication of Remmers, et al, [ 11 ] identifying STAT4 as a susceptibility gene for RA and SLE was published while our fine-mapping effort was ongoing, and after having identified a strong signal for this gene in a 100k scan in Argentine individuals (data not shown). The data from the Spanish mapping suggested the presence of several peaks independent of rs7574865. Analyses using a larger set of joined samples confirmed the independent effect of rs3821236 in intron 16. Conditional SNP and haplotype regression analysis supported this result. We observed differences between North and South European samples: the German set contributed, albeit weakly, to the association only at rs7574865, whereas the association of rs3821236 was contributed particularly by the Spanish, Italian and Latin American sets. In our view it is highly plausible that several independent risk haplotypes are involved in disease susceptibility, with some having stronger effects in some populations than others. The weak result of the German set could not be due to a lack of power, as the size of the other sets is comparable. We are approaching a phase in complex disease genetics where identification of the genes involved in disease susceptibility is becoming a reality. Therefore, it is of interest that we understand the relationship between the various genetic effects. Here we examined the possibility of genetic interaction between IRF5 and STAT4 . We observed no genetic interaction but we observed a significant increase in the predictive ability for SLE when STAT4 and IRF5 SNPs were added. These results suggest that the IRF5 and STAT4 SNPs act additively to increase risk for SLE. While this work was under revision, an independent study corroborated this additive effect [ 24 ]. Identification of the functional variants for STAT4 might prove relatively difficult considering the large size of this gene and the location of the associated SNPs. Complete resequencing of the gene and genotyping may be needed to reveal the true functional variants. We observed no differences in splicing of the gene in PBMCs. Instead we found a correlation between expression levels of STAT4 in PBMCs and the STAT4 associated SNPs, rs7574865, rs3024866 and rs3821236 but not rs1467199. It should be noted that PBMC samples are expected to have varying numbers of T and NK cells, high variation in gene expression, and a weak correlation. Further, in complex diseases we also expect effects caused by functional variants to be modest and difficult to define [ 14 ]. How does a modest increase in STAT4 expression contribute to the risk for SLE? STAT4 is a transcription factor through which the functional effects of IL-12 are conducted, leading to IFN-? production. The STAT4 pathway has been studied in mice and patients with SLE, with contradictory results. In two studies, mice deficient for STAT4 show increased development of glomerulonephritis [ 25 , 26 ], whereas a third study reported opposite findings in line with our observations [ 27 ]. We detected only two isoforms of STAT4 , one of which was expressed at extremely low levels (?), and tissue-specific promoters as observed by the presence of alternative, tissue-specific 5’-UTRs ( Table 3 ). Given that such promoters could adjust transcription of the gene in a particular tissue, this poses an additional obstacle for defining the role of genetic variation. Other authors showed that the STAT4 ’s SLE risk haplotype is over-expressed in mesenchymal cells [ 24 ] supporting a tissue-specific component involved in the regulation of STAT4 expression. Using purified cell populations (e.g. NK cells, which constitute only 5% of the blood leukocytes but have high basal level of STAT4, kidney mesangial cells, etc) may be critical for correct assessment of the altered levels of STAT4 gene expression as well as definition of the splicing isoforms that could be involved. Major effects of the expression of human STAT4 may be important in the kidney. Activation of STAT4 leads to increased expression of IFN-?. A study has shown that increased expression of IL-12 and IFN-? in the kidneys of MRL- lpr/lpr mice precedes the development of glomerulonephritis [ 28 , 29 ]. Thus, the localized action of the various genes in specific tissues may be of importance. This is also important to consider in view of the recent results showing a strong correlation between rs7574865 and end-organ disease, in particular kidney disease [ 30 ]. Our results do support an important role of STAT4 in SLE susceptibility, a role that appears to vary between different populations and deriving from two different and independent risk variants, whose functional nature needs to be addressed.
