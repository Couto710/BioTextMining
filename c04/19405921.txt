Epidemiology of neonatal sepsis in South Korea Background Neonatal sepsis is a severe clinical syndrome characterized by systemic signs of infection, shock and system organ failure; diagnosis is confirmed on positive culture from a normally sterile site(s). There are few reports comparing incidence, mortality, and risk factors between clinically diagnosed sepsis and that confirmed by culture. Methods All infants diagnosed with early- (within first 72 h after birth) or late-onset (72 h–4 weeks after birth) neonatal sepsis between 1997 and 1999 from four neonatal centers in South Korea, were investigated. Results The estimated incidence rate of neonatal sepsis during the 3 years was 30.5 per 1000 live births for clinical sepsis and 6.1 per 1000 live births for sepsis with positive culture, with case-fatality rates of 4.7% and 2.2%, respectively. When only early-onset sepsis was considered, the incidence and fatality rates were 25.1 per 1000 live births and 6.1% for clinical sepsis, and 4.3 per 1000 live births and 2.5% for culture-confirmed sepsis, respectively. For the 179 patients (185 causative organisms) of proven sepsis, Staphylococcus spp. including S. aureus were the most frequent isolates. In early-onset clinical sepsis, having very low birthweight (?1500 g), a low Apgar score at 5 min (?7), and being male were related to higher rates of case-fatality (relative risk: 11.3, 6.8 and 2.5, respectively) Conclusions Clinical sepsis was more common than culture-confirmed sepsis and had a higher case-fatality rate. It seems prudent to take rapid and decisive steps toward better management of the high-risk group whether the sepsis is clinically diagnosed or culture confirmed.  Methods Population and definitions This study included infants who were born or hospitalized for neonatal sepsis at four neonatal centers located in Seoul, Gyeonggi province, and Daejeon from 1997 to 1999. Two out of the four neonatal centers are level III centers and the other two are level II centers (level I, clinic; levels II, general hospital; level III, general hospital and the last referral center); all participating centers were located in training hospitals and have neonatology specialists. We targeted infants within the first month of life who were diagnosed as having neonatal sepsis clinically or via positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture, and reviewed their hospital records retrospectively. The number of infants who were born at study hospitals during the study period was 23 768; the number of patients who were born at study hospitals (inborn) and hos pitalized for neonatal sepsis in study hospitals was 868. The number of patients who were born at other hospitals (outborn) and hospitalized for neonatal sepsis in a study hospital was 412. Neonatal sepsis was defined as a clinical syndrome characterized by systemic signs of infection and/or accompanied by bacteremia in the first month of life. Confirmed sepsis was defined as positive culture from normally sterile sites in association with clinical and laboratory findings. Clinical sepsis was diagnosed when the doctor suspected it to be sepsis based on systemic symptoms and signs, such as temperature instability, lethargy, apnea, poor feeding, and respiratory or gastrointestinal disease (e.g. tachypnea and cyanosis or vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal distention), serology and/or radiology; abnormal leukocyte count (>30 000 cells/?L or <5000 cells/?L), C-reactive protein >1.0 mg/dL, risk factors for vertical transmission and/or intrapartum administration of antibiotics, and negative culture. 15 When a patient was re-hospitalized within 3 days after discharge with the same diagnosis, the two hospitalization records were combined into one. We divided neonatal sepsis cases into groups, by whether the baby was born at a study hospital (inborn) or in another hospital but treated for sepsis at a study hospital (outborn). Gestational age was determined by obstetrical methods, which include dating from the last menstrual period and use of prenatal ultrasonography, or estimated by a neonatologist on the basis of physical and neurologic criteria. ROM lasting longer than 18 h was considered to be a risk factor for infection of the infant, especially when complicated by chorioamnionitis. Not knowing the exact time of membrane rupture, however, we classified the corresponding group as ‘unknown’. Following standard definitions, neonatal sepsis was classified into early (?72 h) and late onset (>72 h–<4 weeks) based on postnatal age at onset. 1 Early-onset sepsis is generally considered to originate from vertical transmission. The progression of late-onset neonatal sepsis is relatively slow, usually occurs in the nursery, and is associated with skin and soft-tissue lesions and focal infections as well as nosocomial and health-care-associated infections. Because focal infections, such as meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, otitis media, conjunctivitis, omphalitis, cellulitis or osteomyelitis, may precede or accompany neonatal sepsis, we also investigated diseases associated with neonatal sepsis and positive culture results from blood, CSF, urine or other sterile sites. The associated diseases were grouped using the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Data collection We reviewed medical records for perinatal characteristics and risk factors for sepsis such as sex, gestational age, birthweight, 1 and 5 min Apgar scores, delivery methods, birth hospitals (study hospitals vs other hospitals), and prolonged ROM. Trained medical students entered medical record data on mothers and on newborn infants onto a computer using Excel software, which was confirmed by a researcher. The researcher classified the outcome of sepsis either as survival or death. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Michigan on 14 November 2003. Data analysis The incidence of sepsis was estimated by dividing the number of inborn infants with sepsis by the total number of live births from all four centers. The confidence interval of the incidence rate was calculated using Poisson distribution. The case fatality rate was estimated by dividing the number of deaths from sepsis by the total number of sepsis cases. We used the ?2 test, log likelihood test and Fisher’s exact test to assess the associations between known and hypothesized risk factors of sepsis. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to assess associations between case fatality of sepsis and maternal or neonatal characteristics. Analyses of clustered data were performed using SPSS 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to assess associations between case fatality of sepsis and maternal or neonatal characteristics. Analyses of clustered data were performed using SPSS 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).  Results Incidence of neonatal sepsis The incidence of early-onset neonatal sepsis confirmed on culture was 4.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.1–6.3) per 1000 live births in 1997, 6.6 (95%CI: 5.0–8.7) in 1998, and 1.7 (95%CI: 1.0–2.9) in 1999, with a 3 year annual average incidence rate of 4.3 (95%CI: 3.5–5.2). The incidence rates of late-onset neonatal sepsis from 1997 to 1999 were lower: 1.4, 2.6 and 1.2 per 1000 live births, respectively. Clinical sepsis rates, however, for both early and late onset were significantly higher: 34.1 (1997), 24.5 (1998), and 16.7 (1999) per 1000 live births for early-onset sepsis and 5.4 (1997), 4.9 (1998), and 6.0 (1999) per 1000 live births for late-onset sepsis. The incidence of early-onset neonatal sepsis tended to decrease every year for both culture-confirmed sepsis ( P = 0.007) and clinical sepsis ( P < 0.001). There was no significant decline, however, in the rate of late-onset neonatal sepsis ( P = 0.79, confirmed sepsis; P = 0.61, clinical sepsis; Table 1 ). The majority of sepsis cases were not confirmed by culture: among inborn patients, 14.6% of early-onset sepsis (102/697) and 24.4% of late-onset sepsis (42/171) were culture confirmed. Among outborn patients the confirmation rate was much lower: only 6.2% of early-onset sepsis (16/257) and 12.3% of late-onset sepsis (19/155) were culture confirmed. The differences in confirmation rate between inborn cases and outborn cases ( P < 0.001), and early- and late-onset neonatal sepsis ( P = 0.006) were statistically significant. Microbiology of neonatal sepsis A total of 185 pathogens were isolated from 179 infants confirmed by culture. The most frequently isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (44.5%), followed by other staphylococcus (31.3%), Escherichia coli (9.3%), streptococcal species excluding Streptococcus agalacteae (7.7%), candida species (6.0%), and other pathogens (1.6%, one pseudomonas species, one proteus and one pheomycosis). Streptococcus agalacteae was isolated from two patients (1.1%, two of 185 positive cultures; Table 2 ). Risk factors for early-onset neonatal sepsis among culture-confirmed and clinical sepsis More male than female infants developed both early-onset and late-onset sepsis; gender differences were more pronounced in culture-confirmed cases but the differences by onset were not statistically significant ( P = 0.14, confirmed-sepsis; P = 0.85, clinical sepsis). Prolonged ROM ?18 h occurred more frequently among early- than late-onset cases ( P = 0.005, confirmed sepsis; P < 0.001, clinical sepsis). Infants born in study centers (inborn infants) with sepsis were more common in early-onset sepsis than in late-onset sepsis ( P = 0.005, confirmed sepsis; P < 0.001, clinical sepsis). There were no significant differences, however, in delivery method in both culture-confirmed and clinical neonatal sepsis ( P = 0.30, confirmed sepsis; P = 0.08, clinical sepsis; Table 3 ). The median birthweight of infants with culture-confirmed and clinically diagnosed sepsis was 3240 g and 2960 g, respectively. The birthweight for early-onset sepsis was lower than that for late-onset sepsis, the difference being statistically significant for clinically diagnosed sepsis ( P < 0.001). Younger gestational age also occurred significantly more frequently among early-onset sepsis compared with late-onset sepsis in both culture-confirmed and clinically diagnosed sepsis ( P = 0.01, P < 0.001, respectively). The proportion of 5 min Apgar scores ?7 was higher in early-onset sepsis than in late-onset sepsis in both culture-confirmed and clinically diagnosed sepsis, with the difference being statistically significant in clinically diagnosed sepsis ( P < 0.001). There were 22 patients who had 0–3 Apgar score of 5 min, among these, 21 had ‘clinically diagnosed early-onset sepsis’ and one had ‘confirmed early-onset sepsis’. The duration of hospitalization for early-onset sepsis was longer than that for late-onset sepsis, with the difference being significant in both confirmed ( P = 0.003) and clinical sepsis ( P < 0.001; Table 3 ). For early onset sepsis, more cases of <37 weeks ( P = 0.02), ?2500 g ( P < 0.001), and ?7 Apgar score ( P < 0.001) were included in clinical sepsis, than in culture-confirmed sepsis, which implies that more severe cases were included using the clinical definition. The duration of hospitalization was significantly longer for early-onset sepsis than late-onset sepsis for both clinically diagnosed and confirmed cases; and the duration was longer for clinical than confirmed cases ( P = 0.004). In late-onset sepsis the proportion of boys in confirmed cases was significantly higher than that of clinical sepsis ( P = 0.01). More inborn cases were culture confirmed than outborn cases in both early- ( P < 0.001) and late-onset sepsis ( P = 0.02). Focal infections associated with neonatal sepsis Out of the 179 infants with culture-confirmed neonatal sepsis, 50 infants (27.9%) had focal infections, with 52 infections occurring among the 50 infants. Of these, 32 infections were related to early-onset sepsis and 20 infections were related to late-onset sepsis. Urinary tract infection was the most common focal infection for both early-onset and late-onset sepsis (46.9%, 15/32; 45.0%, 9/20). Of the 1101 infants with clinical sepsis, 118 (10.7%) had focal infections, with 122 infections occurring among the 118 infections. Of these, 64 infections were related to early-onset sepsis and 58 infections of were related to late-onset sepsis. Among the 64 infections of early-onset neonatal sepsis patients, pneumonia (43.8%) was the most common focal infection, followed by urinary tract infection (20.3%), conjunctivitis (18.8%), omphalitis (10.9%), and meningitis (4.7%). Among the 58 infections of late-onset neonatal sepsis patients, meningitis (46.6%) was the most frequent focal infection, followed by urinary tract infection (17.2%), conjunctivitis (12.1%), and pneumonia (12.1%; Table 4 ). Risk factors associated with the case fatality rate in early-onset neonatal sepsis The case fatality rate of neonatal sepsis, clinical or culture-confirmed, was 4.4%. The fatality rate, however, was significantly higher in early-onset sepsis than in late-onset sepsis (5.7%, 54/954 vs 0.6%, 2/326, P < 0.001; Table 3 ). Of 179 infants with culture-confirmed sepsis, four died (2.2%, 4/179). The case fatality rate of clinical cases was higher than confirmed cases (4.7% vs 2.2%), but not statistically significant ( P = 0.12). Among culture-confirmed cases, the fatality rate appeared to be higher in early-onset sepsis than in late-onset sepsis (2.5% vs 1.6%), this difference also was not statistically significant ( P = 1.00, Fisher‘s exact test). Organisms causing mortality were Streptococcus agalacteae (one infant) and E. coli (two infants) in early-onset sepsis and Staphylococcus aureus (one infant) in late-onset sepsis. Among early-onset clinical sepsis, the fatality rate in 1998 decreased from that of 1997 but, overall, there was no statistically significant difference year to year. Infants who were outborn had a significantly lower mortality rate, 3.2%, compared to 7.2% of inborn infants. Factors such as sex, mode of delivery, and prolonged ROM lasting 18 h were not significantly associated with mortality. Very low birthweight (?1500 g; VLBW) compared to higher birthweight (2500 g) was associated with an increased risk of mortality (relative risk [RR], 29.4; 95%CI: 14.24–60.62). Short gestational periods (?32 weeks) compared to term births were also associated with an increased risk of mortality (RR, 16.9; 95%CI: 8.69–33.02). Low (?7) compared to higher Apgar scores (?8) at 5 min after birth was associated with an increased risk of mortality (RR, 17.5; 95%CI: 7.64–39.93; Table 5 ). To identify the joint effects of the risk factors individually associated with case fatality in early-onset clinical sepsis, we fitted a multiple logistic regression model. We excluded the gestational age from the model because gestational age is closely related to birthweight and Apgar score. After adjustment for gender, birthweight, and Apgar score, the case fatality rate in early-onset clinical sepsis was higher in male infants than in female infants (RR, 2.5; 95%CI: 1.21–5.06). In addition, ?1500 g birthweight was associated with increased fatality rate (RR, 11.3; 95%CI: 4.55–28.21). An Apgar score 5 min after birth of ?7 score also was associated with increased fatality rate (RR, 6.8; 95%CI: 2.62–17.55; Table 5 ). The small number of culture-confirmed cases of early-onset sepsis precluded identifying risk factors for fatality in that group.  Results Incidence of neonatal sepsis The incidence of early-onset neonatal sepsis confirmed on culture was 4.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.1–6.3) per 1000 live births in 1997, 6.6 (95%CI: 5.0–8.7) in 1998, and 1.7 (95%CI: 1.0–2.9) in 1999, with a 3 year annual average incidence rate of 4.3 (95%CI: 3.5–5.2). The incidence rates of late-onset neonatal sepsis from 1997 to 1999 were lower: 1.4, 2.6 and 1.2 per 1000 live births, respectively. Clinical sepsis rates, however, for both early and late onset were significantly higher: 34.1 (1997), 24.5 (1998), and 16.7 (1999) per 1000 live births for early-onset sepsis and 5.4 (1997), 4.9 (1998), and 6.0 (1999) per 1000 live births for late-onset sepsis.

The birthweight for early-onset sepsis was lower than that for late-onset sepsis, the difference being statistically significant for clinically diagnosed sepsis ( P < 0.001). Younger gestational age also occurred significantly more frequently among early-onset sepsis compared with late-onset sepsis in both culture-confirmed and clinically diagnosed sepsis ( P = 0.01, P < 0.001, respectively).

There were 22 patients who had 0–3 Apgar score of 5 min, among these, 21 had ‘clinically diagnosed early-onset sepsis’ and one had ‘confirmed early-onset sepsis’. The duration of hospitalization for early-onset sepsis was longer than that for late-onset sepsis, with the difference being significant in both confirmed ( P = 0.003) and clinical sepsis ( P < 0.001; Table 3 ). For early onset sepsis, more cases of <37 weeks ( P = 0.02), ?2500 g ( P < 0.001), and ?7 Apgar score ( P < 0.001) were included in clinical sepsis, than in culture-confirmed sepsis, which implies that more severe cases were included using the clinical definition. The duration of hospitalization was significantly longer for early-onset sepsis than late-onset sepsis for both clinically diagnosed and confirmed cases; and the duration was longer for clinical than confirmed cases ( P = 0.004). In late-onset sepsis the proportion of boys in confirmed cases was significantly higher than that of clinical sepsis ( P = 0.01). More inborn cases were culture confirmed than outborn cases in both early- ( P < 0.001) and late-onset sepsis ( P = 0.02). Focal infections associated with neonatal sepsis Out of the 179 infants with culture-confirmed neonatal sepsis, 50 infants (27.9%) had focal infections, with 52 infections occurring among the 50 infants. Of these, 32 infections were related to early-onset sepsis and 20 infections were related to late-onset sepsis. Urinary tract infection was the most common focal infection for both early-onset and late-onset sepsis (46.9%, 15/32; 45.0%, 9/20). Of the 1101 infants with clinical sepsis, 118 (10.7%) had focal infections, with 122 infections occurring among the 118 infections. Of these, 64 infections were related to early-onset sepsis and 58 infections of were related to late-onset sepsis. Among the 64 infections of early-onset neonatal sepsis patients, pneumonia (43.8%) was the most common focal infection, followed by urinary tract infection (20.3%), conjunctivitis (18.8%), omphalitis (10.9%), and meningitis (4.7%). Among the 58 infections of late-onset neonatal sepsis patients, meningitis (46.6%) was the most frequent focal infection, followed by urinary tract infection (17.2%), conjunctivitis (12.1%), and pneumonia (12.1%; Table 4 ). Risk factors associated with the case fatality rate in early-onset neonatal sepsis The case fatality rate of neonatal sepsis, clinical or culture-confirmed, was 4.4%. The fatality rate, however, was significantly higher in early-onset sepsis than in late-onset sepsis (5.7%, 54/954 vs 0.6%, 2/326, P < 0.001; Table 3 ). Of 179 infants with culture-confirmed sepsis, four died (2.2%, 4/179). The case fatality rate of clinical cases was higher than confirmed cases (4.7% vs 2.2%), but not statistically significant ( P = 0.12). Among culture-confirmed cases, the fatality rate appeared to be higher in early-onset sepsis than in late-onset sepsis (2.5% vs 1.6%), this difference also was not statistically significant ( P = 1.00, Fisher‘s exact test). Organisms causing mortality were Streptococcus agalacteae (one infant) and E. coli (two infants) in early-onset sepsis and Staphylococcus aureus (one infant) in late-onset sepsis. Among early-onset clinical sepsis, the fatality rate in 1998 decreased from that of 1997 but, overall, there was no statistically significant difference year to year. Infants who were outborn had a significantly lower mortality rate, 3.2%, compared to 7.2% of inborn infants. Factors such as sex, mode of delivery, and prolonged ROM lasting 18 h were not significantly associated with mortality. Very low birthweight (?1500 g; VLBW) compared to higher birthweight (2500 g) was associated with an increased risk of mortality (relative risk [RR], 29.4; 95%CI: 14.24–60.62). Short gestational periods (?32 weeks) compared to term births were also associated with an increased risk of mortality (RR, 16.9; 95%CI: 8.69–33.02). Low (?7) compared to higher Apgar scores (?8) at 5 min after birth was associated with an increased risk of mortality (RR, 17.5; 95%CI: 7.64–39.93; Table 5 ). To identify the joint effects of the risk factors individually associated with case fatality in early-onset clinical sepsis, we fitted a multiple logistic regression model. We excluded the gestational age from the model because gestational age is closely related to birthweight and Apgar score. After adjustment for gender, birthweight, and Apgar score, the case fatality rate in early-onset clinical sepsis was higher in male infants than in female infants (RR, 2.5; 95%CI: 1.21–5.06). In addition, ?1500 g birthweight was associated with increased fatality rate (RR, 11.3; 95%CI: 4.55–28.21). An Apgar score 5 min after birth of ?7 score also was associated with increased fatality rate (RR, 6.8; 95%CI: 2.62–17.55; Table 5 ). The small number of culture-confirmed cases of early-onset sepsis precluded identifying risk factors for fatality in that group.  Incidence of neonatal sepsis The incidence of early-onset neonatal sepsis confirmed on culture was 4.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.1–6.3) per 1000 live births in 1997, 6.6 (95%CI: 5.0–8.7) in 1998, and 1.7 (95%CI: 1.0–2.9) in 1999, with a 3 year annual average incidence rate of 4.3 (95%CI: 3.5–5.2). The incidence rates of late-onset neonatal sepsis from 1997 to 1999 were lower: 1.4, 2.6 and 1.2 per 1000 live births, respectively. Clinical sepsis rates, however, for both early and late onset were significantly higher: 34.1 (1997), 24.5 (1998), and 16.7 (1999) per 1000 live births for early-onset sepsis and 5.4 (1997), 4.9 (1998), and 6.0 (1999) per 1000 live births for late-onset sepsis. The incidence of early-onset neonatal sepsis tended to decrease every year for both culture-confirmed sepsis ( P = 0.007) and clinical sepsis ( P < 0.001). There was no significant decline, however, in the rate of late-onset neonatal sepsis ( P = 0.79, confirmed sepsis; P = 0.61, clinical sepsis; Table 1 ). The majority of sepsis cases were not confirmed by culture: among inborn patients, 14.6% of early-onset sepsis (102/697) and 24.4% of late-onset sepsis (42/171) were culture confirmed. Among outborn patients the confirmation rate was much lower: only 6.2% of early-onset sepsis (16/257) and 12.3% of late-onset sepsis (19/155) were culture confirmed. The differences in confirmation rate between inborn cases and outborn cases ( P < 0.001), and early- and late-onset neonatal sepsis ( P = 0.006) were statistically significant.  Incidence of neonatal sepsis The incidence of early-onset neonatal sepsis confirmed on culture was 4.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.1–6.3) per 1000 live births in 1997, 6.6 (95%CI: 5.0–8.7) in 1998, and 1.7 (95%CI: 1.0–2.9) in 1999, with a 3 year annual average incidence rate of 4.3 (95%CI: 3.5–5.2). The incidence rates of late-onset neonatal sepsis from 1997 to 1999 were lower: 1.4, 2.6 and 1.2 per 1000 live births, respectively. Clinical sepsis rates, however, for both early and late onset were significantly higher: 34.1 (1997), 24.5 (1998), and 16.7 (1999) per 1000 live births for early-onset sepsis and 5.4 (1997), 4.9 (1998), and 6.0 (1999) per 1000 live births for late-onset sepsis. The incidence of early-onset neonatal sepsis tended to decrease every year for both culture-confirmed sepsis ( P = 0.007) and clinical sepsis ( P < 0.001). There was no significant decline, however, in the rate of late-onset neonatal sepsis ( P = 0.79, confirmed sepsis; P = 0.61, clinical sepsis; Table 1 ). The majority of sepsis cases were not confirmed by culture: among inborn patients, 14.6% of early-onset sepsis (102/697) and 24.4% of late-onset sepsis (42/171) were culture confirmed. Among outborn patients the confirmation rate was much lower: only 6.2% of early-onset sepsis (16/257) and 12.3% of late-onset sepsis (19/155) were culture confirmed. The differences in confirmation rate between inborn cases and outborn cases ( P < 0.001), and early- and late-onset neonatal sepsis ( P = 0.006) were statistically significant.  Microbiology of neonatal sepsis A total of 185 pathogens were isolated from 179 infants confirmed by culture. The most frequently isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (44.5%), followed by other staphylococcus (31.3%), Escherichia coli (9.3%), streptococcal species excluding Streptococcus agalacteae (7.7%), candida species (6.0%), and other pathogens (1.6%, one pseudomonas species, one proteus and one pheomycosis). Streptococcus agalacteae was isolated from two patients (1.1%, two of 185 positive cultures; Table 2 ).

The most frequently isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (44.5%), followed by other staphylococcus (31.3%), Escherichia coli (9.3%), streptococcal species excluding Streptococcus agalacteae (7.7%), candida species (6.0%), and other pathogens (1.6%, one pseudomonas species, one proteus and one pheomycosis). Streptococcus agalacteae was isolated from two patients (1.1%, two of 185 positive cultures; Table 2 ).  Risk factors for early-onset neonatal sepsis among culture-confirmed and clinical sepsis More male than female infants developed both early-onset and late-onset sepsis; gender differences were more pronounced in culture-confirmed cases but the differences by onset were not statistically significant ( P = 0.14, confirmed-sepsis; P = 0.85, clinical sepsis). Prolonged ROM ?18 h occurred more frequently among early- than late-onset cases ( P = 0.005, confirmed sepsis; P < 0.001, clinical sepsis). Infants born in study centers (inborn infants) with sepsis were more common in early-onset sepsis than in late-onset sepsis ( P = 0.005, confirmed sepsis; P < 0.001, clinical sepsis). There were no significant differences, however, in delivery method in both culture-confirmed and clinical neonatal sepsis ( P = 0.30, confirmed sepsis; P = 0.08, clinical sepsis; Table 3 ). The median birthweight of infants with culture-confirmed and clinically diagnosed sepsis was 3240 g and 2960 g, respectively. The birthweight for early-onset sepsis was lower than that for late-onset sepsis, the difference being statistically significant for clinically diagnosed sepsis ( P < 0.001). Younger gestational age also occurred significantly more frequently among early-onset sepsis compared with late-onset sepsis in both culture-confirmed and clinically diagnosed sepsis ( P = 0.01, P < 0.001, respectively). The proportion of 5 min Apgar scores ?7 was higher in early-onset sepsis than in late-onset sepsis in both culture-confirmed and clinically diagnosed sepsis, with the difference being statistically significant in clinically diagnosed sepsis ( P < 0.001). There were 22 patients who had 0–3 Apgar score of 5 min, among these, 21 had ‘clinically diagnosed early-onset sepsis’ and one had ‘confirmed early-onset sepsis’. The duration of hospitalization for early-onset sepsis was longer than that for late-onset sepsis, with the difference being significant in both confirmed ( P = 0.003) and clinical sepsis ( P < 0.001; Table 3 ). For early onset sepsis, more cases of <37 weeks ( P = 0.02), ?2500 g ( P < 0.001), and ?7 Apgar score ( P < 0.001) were included in clinical sepsis, than in culture-confirmed sepsis, which implies that more severe cases were included using the clinical definition. The duration of hospitalization was significantly longer for early-onset sepsis than late-onset sepsis for both clinically diagnosed and confirmed cases; and the duration was longer for clinical than confirmed cases ( P = 0.004). In late-onset sepsis the proportion of boys in confirmed cases was significantly higher than that of clinical sepsis ( P = 0.01). More inborn cases were culture confirmed than outborn cases in both early- ( P < 0.001) and late-onset sepsis ( P = 0.02).  Risk factors for early-onset neonatal sepsis among culture-confirmed and clinical sepsis More male than female infants developed both early-onset and late-onset sepsis; gender differences were more pronounced in culture-confirmed cases but the differences by onset were not statistically significant ( P = 0.14, confirmed-sepsis; P = 0.85, clinical sepsis).

The birthweight for early-onset sepsis was lower than that for late-onset sepsis, the difference being statistically significant for clinically diagnosed sepsis ( P < 0.001). Younger gestational age also occurred significantly more frequently among early-onset sepsis compared with late-onset sepsis in both culture-confirmed and clinically diagnosed sepsis ( P = 0.01, P < 0.001, respectively). The proportion of 5 min Apgar scores ?7 was higher in early-onset sepsis than in late-onset sepsis in both culture-confirmed and clinically diagnosed sepsis, with the difference being statistically significant in clinically diagnosed sepsis ( P < 0.001). There were 22 patients who had 0–3 Apgar score of 5 min, among these, 21 had ‘clinically diagnosed early-onset sepsis’ and one had ‘confirmed early-onset sepsis’. The duration of hospitalization for early-onset sepsis was longer than that for late-onset sepsis, with the difference being significant in both confirmed ( P = 0.003) and clinical sepsis ( P < 0.001; Table 3 ). For early onset sepsis, more cases of <37 weeks ( P = 0.02), ?2500 g ( P < 0.001), and ?7 Apgar score ( P < 0.001) were included in clinical sepsis, than in culture-confirmed sepsis, which implies that more severe cases were included using the clinical definition. The duration of hospitalization was significantly longer for early-onset sepsis than late-onset sepsis for both clinically diagnosed and confirmed cases; and the duration was longer for clinical than confirmed cases ( P = 0.004). In late-onset sepsis the proportion of boys in confirmed cases was significantly higher than that of clinical sepsis ( P = 0.01). More inborn cases were culture confirmed than outborn cases in both early- ( P < 0.001) and late-onset sepsis ( P = 0.02).  Focal infections associated with neonatal sepsis Out of the 179 infants with culture-confirmed neonatal sepsis, 50 infants (27.9%) had focal infections, with 52 infections occurring among the 50 infants. Of these, 32 infections were related to early-onset sepsis and 20 infections were related to late-onset sepsis. Urinary tract infection was the most common focal infection for both early-onset and late-onset sepsis (46.9%, 15/32; 45.0%, 9/20). Of the 1101 infants with clinical sepsis, 118 (10.7%) had focal infections, with 122 infections occurring among the 118 infections. Of these, 64 infections were related to early-onset sepsis and 58 infections of were related to late-onset sepsis. Among the 64 infections of early-onset neonatal sepsis patients, pneumonia (43.8%) was the most common focal infection, followed by urinary tract infection (20.3%), conjunctivitis (18.8%), omphalitis (10.9%), and meningitis (4.7%). Among the 58 infections of late-onset neonatal sepsis patients, meningitis (46.6%) was the most frequent focal infection, followed by urinary tract infection (17.2%), conjunctivitis (12.1%), and pneumonia (12.1%; Table 4 ).  Focal infections associated with neonatal sepsis Out of the 179 infants with culture-confirmed neonatal sepsis, 50 infants (27.9%) had focal infections, with 52 infections occurring among the 50 infants. Of these, 32 infections were related to early-onset sepsis and 20 infections were related to late-onset sepsis. Urinary tract infection was the most common focal infection for both early-onset and late-onset sepsis (46.9%, 15/32; 45.0%, 9/20).

Among the 58 infections of late-onset neonatal sepsis patients, meningitis (46.6%) was the most frequent focal infection, followed by urinary tract infection (17.2%), conjunctivitis (12.1%), and pneumonia (12.1%; Table 4 ).  Risk factors associated with the case fatality rate in early-onset neonatal sepsis The case fatality rate of neonatal sepsis, clinical or culture-confirmed, was 4.4%. The fatality rate, however, was significantly higher in early-onset sepsis than in late-onset sepsis (5.7%, 54/954 vs 0.6%, 2/326, P < 0.001; Table 3 ). Of 179 infants with culture-confirmed sepsis, four died (2.2%, 4/179). The case fatality rate of clinical cases was higher than confirmed cases (4.7% vs 2.2%), but not statistically significant ( P = 0.12). Among culture-confirmed cases, the fatality rate appeared to be higher in early-onset sepsis than in late-onset sepsis (2.5% vs 1.6%), this difference also was not statistically significant ( P = 1.00, Fisher‘s exact test). Organisms causing mortality were Streptococcus agalacteae (one infant) and E. coli (two infants) in early-onset sepsis and Staphylococcus aureus (one infant) in late-onset sepsis. Among early-onset clinical sepsis, the fatality rate in 1998 decreased from that of 1997 but, overall, there was no statistically significant difference year to year. Infants who were outborn had a significantly lower mortality rate, 3.2%, compared to 7.2% of inborn infants. Factors such as sex, mode of delivery, and prolonged ROM lasting 18 h were not significantly associated with mortality. Very low birthweight (?1500 g; VLBW) compared to higher birthweight (2500 g) was associated with an increased risk of mortality (relative risk [RR], 29.4; 95%CI: 14.24–60.62). Short gestational periods (?32 weeks) compared to term births were also associated with an increased risk of mortality (RR, 16.9; 95%CI: 8.69–33.02). Low (?7) compared to higher Apgar scores (?8) at 5 min after birth was associated with an increased risk of mortality (RR, 17.5; 95%CI: 7.64–39.93; Table 5 ). To identify the joint effects of the risk factors individually associated with case fatality in early-onset clinical sepsis, we fitted a multiple logistic regression model. We excluded the gestational age from the model because gestational age is closely related to birthweight and Apgar score. After adjustment for gender, birthweight, and Apgar score, the case fatality rate in early-onset clinical sepsis was higher in male infants than in female infants (RR, 2.5; 95%CI: 1.21–5.06). In addition, ?1500 g birthweight was associated with increased fatality rate (RR, 11.3; 95%CI: 4.55–28.21). An Apgar score 5 min after birth of ?7 score also was associated with increased fatality rate (RR, 6.8; 95%CI: 2.62–17.55; Table 5 ). The small number of culture-confirmed cases of early-onset sepsis precluded identifying risk factors for fatality in that group.  Risk factors associated with the case fatality rate in early-onset neonatal sepsis The case fatality rate of neonatal sepsis, clinical or culture-confirmed, was 4.4%. The fatality rate, however, was significantly higher in early-onset sepsis than in late-onset sepsis (5.7%, 54/954 vs 0.6%, 2/326, P < 0.001; Table 3 ). Of 179 infants with culture-confirmed sepsis, four died (2.2%, 4/179). The case fatality rate of clinical cases was higher than confirmed cases (4.7% vs 2.2%), but not statistically significant ( P = 0.12). Among culture-confirmed cases, the fatality rate appeared to be higher in early-onset sepsis than in late-onset sepsis (2.5% vs 1.6%), this difference also was not statistically significant ( P = 1.00, Fisher‘s exact test).

Infants who were outborn had a significantly lower mortality rate, 3.2%, compared to 7.2% of inborn infants. Factors such as sex, mode of delivery, and prolonged ROM lasting 18 h were not significantly associated with mortality. Very low birthweight (?1500 g; VLBW) compared to higher birthweight (2500 g) was associated with an increased risk of mortality (relative risk [RR], 29.4; 95%CI: 14.24–60.62). Short gestational periods (?32 weeks) compared to term births were also associated with an increased risk of mortality (RR, 16.9; 95%CI: 8.69–33.02). Low (?7) compared to higher Apgar scores (?8) at 5 min after birth was associated with an increased risk of mortality (RR, 17.5; 95%CI: 7.64–39.93; Table 5 ). To identify the joint effects of the risk factors individually associated with case fatality in early-onset clinical sepsis, we fitted a multiple logistic regression model.

In addition, ?1500 g birthweight was associated with increased fatality rate (RR, 11.3; 95%CI: 4.55–28.21). An Apgar score 5 min after birth of ?7 score also was associated with increased fatality rate (RR, 6.8; 95%CI: 2.62–17.55; Table 5 ). The small number of culture-confirmed cases of early-onset sepsis precluded identifying risk factors for fatality in that group.  Discussion Among Korean infants born at one of four neonatal centers located in Seoul, Gyeonggi province, and Daejeon between 1997 and 1999, the incidence rate of culture-confirmed sepsis was 6.1 per 1000 live births (4.3 for early onset and 1.8 for late onset). We found no more recent incidence estimates in the literature. The incidence rate is similar to the rate reported in 1997 for Korea of 6.6 per 1000 live births, 3 and to that reported for Malaysia, 16 Africa, South America and the Caribbean, and considerably lower than that for China, 9 with slightly higher rates of early-onset sepsis but lower rates of late-onset sepsis than reported for the USA and Australia. 4 , 17 – 19 The incidence rate, however, of clinically diagnosed sepsis, 30.5 per 1000 live births (724 of 23 768), was considerably higher than similar reports from other countries, as was the ratio of 5 for clinically diagnosed to culture-confirmed cases. In Spain the incidence of clinical sepsis was 3.6 per 1000 live births, 15 with a ratio of clinically diagnosed to culture-confirmed of 1.4. In the USA, in a study conducted in a health-care maintenance organization population, the incidence of clinical sepsis was 2 per 1000 live births; they did not report any culture-confirmed cases. 20 At least in the present data, however, the case-fatality rates was higher for clinically diagnosed than culture-confirmed sepsis. Because antimicrobial treatment is commonly given in Korea to babies with sepsis-like symptoms, without waiting for culture confirmation (Hye Sun Yoon, pers. comm., 2007), bacteria often cannot be cultured from clinically diagnosed sepsis cases. This would increase the numbers of clinically diagnosed sepsis cases. There also may be differences in assignment of diagnostic category, which would account for some of the large variation in rates of clinical diagnoses between countries. A variety of microorganisms cause neonatal sepsis, with local variations in organism type. Prior to the implementation of group B Streptococcus screening followed by intrapartum prophylaxis, group B Streptococcus was the most common cause of neonatal sepsis in the USA followed by Gram-negative enteric bacilli, predominantly E. coli . 1 Many other pathogens, however, including Staphylococcus aureus , coagulase-negative staphylococcal species, Viridans streptococci, E. coli , Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp. have recently emerged as significant pathogens for neonatal sepsis in the USA. 12 , 21 Among the culture-confirmed cases in the present study, Staphylococcus spp. including S. aureus were the most frequent pathogens, followed by Streptococcus and E. coli for early-onset sepsis, and by E. coli , Streptococcus and Candida spp. for late-onset sepsis. The low rate of group B Streptococcus , which is susceptible to many antibiotics, might reflect the extravagant use of antibiotics: intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis is commonly given in Korea in all cases of ROM, rather than waiting for 18 h as is recommended in the USA. The present observed incidence of late-onset sepsis due to Candida spp., 0.46 per 1000 live births, is lower than that in reports from Israel of 0.4–2 per 1000 live births. 22 Candida is especially a problem for infants cared for in intensive care units, where rates are considerably higher, ranging from 3.8% to 12.9% for VLBW infants, 22 accounting for 0.5–2.0% of neonatal intensive care unit admissions. Consistent with the literature, many of the infants’ mothers experienced prolonged ROM, and the proportions were higher among those with early-onset disease for both clinically diagnosed and culture-confirmed cases. 17 Also consistent with the literature, vaginal delivery was more common among early-onset sepsis than in late-onset sepsis cases in both proven and clinical sepsis. 23 In the present study urinary tract infection (46.0% in culture-confirmed, 18.9% in clinical) was the most common focal infection followed by meningitis, pneumonia, conjunctivitis, skin infection and omphalitis. Excluding pneumonia and meningitis, we found no difference in the distribution of focal infection type between late- and early-onset cases. The percent of focal infection (excluding pneumonia or meningitis), however, in late-onset sepsis was higher than that of early-onset sepsis in both culture-confirmed (24.6% vs 16.9%) and clinical sepsis (9.1% vs 3.9%). This is similar to previous studies that suggest that focal infection involving any organ (excluding pneumonia or meningitis), occurs most frequently in neonates with late-onset rather than early-onset disease. 1 Previous studies of culture-confirmed sepsis in Korea have reported higher case-fatality rates for neonatal sepsis than the 2.2% reported here: 24.3% in the 1960s, 8 15.2% in the 1970s, 24 21.9% 25 –27.8% in the 1980s 26 , and 17.1% in the 1990s. 10 Changes in case-fatality rates over time may reflect differences in patient populations or changes in environmental factors or medical practice. The estimated fatality rate for culture-confirmed sepsis, 2.2% (4/179), was lower than that reported for 1995–1997 in Spain, 8.7%, 15 and for 2002–2005 in Iran, 19.8%, 27 but for clinical sepsis the fatality rate of 4.7% (52/1100) is similar to the 4.3% 15 of the 1995–1997 Spain study. Differences among countries may reflect differences in host and environmental factors and medical practice. Although birthweight and Apgar score have been associated previously with risk of early onset neonatal sepsis, we found no earlier reports suggesting that they predict mortality. Gestational age is associated with birthweight and has been previously associated with mortality. We cannot rule out, however, that the infection led to premature labor and delivery, and hence the VLBW and young gestational age. Because the present study was retrospective we could not validate the exact cause for preterm delivery for all cases, nor if there were other conditions present in premature infants that might have increases risk of mortality such as hyaline membrane disease and intraventricular hemorrhage. Nonetheless, VLBW (?1500 g) and a lower Apgar scores 5 min after birth (?7) increased the fatality rate, by RR = 11.3 and RR = 6.8 respectively, thus it seems prudent to take rapid and decisive steps toward better management of this group whether the sepsis is clinically diagnosed or culture-confirmed.  Discussion Among Korean infants born at one of four neonatal centers located in Seoul, Gyeonggi province, and Daejeon between 1997 and 1999, the incidence rate of culture-confirmed sepsis was 6.1 per 1000 live births (4.3 for early onset and 1.8 for late onset). We found no more recent incidence estimates in the literature. The incidence rate is similar to the rate reported in 1997 for Korea of 6.6 per 1000 live births, 3 and to that reported for Malaysia, 16 Africa, South America and the Caribbean, and considerably lower than that for China, 9 with slightly higher rates of early-onset sepsis but lower rates of late-onset sepsis than reported for the USA and Australia. 4 , 17 – 19 The incidence rate, however, of clinically diagnosed sepsis, 30.5 per 1000 live births (724 of 23 768), was considerably higher than similar reports from other countries, as was the ratio of 5 for clinically diagnosed to culture-confirmed cases. In Spain the incidence of clinical sepsis was 3.6 per 1000 live births, 15 with a ratio of clinically diagnosed to culture-confirmed of 1.4. In the USA, in a study conducted in a health-care maintenance organization population, the incidence of clinical sepsis was 2 per 1000 live births; they did not report any culture-confirmed cases. 20 At least in the present data, however, the case-fatality rates was higher for clinically diagnosed than culture-confirmed sepsis. Because antimicrobial treatment is commonly given in Korea to babies with sepsis-like symptoms, without waiting for culture confirmation (Hye Sun Yoon, pers. comm., 2007), bacteria often cannot be cultured from clinically diagnosed sepsis cases. This would increase the numbers of clinically diagnosed sepsis cases. There also may be differences in assignment of diagnostic category, which would account for some of the large variation in rates of clinical diagnoses between countries. A variety of microorganisms cause neonatal sepsis, with local variations in organism type. Prior to the implementation of group B Streptococcus screening followed by intrapartum prophylaxis, group B Streptococcus was the most common cause of neonatal sepsis in the USA followed by Gram-negative enteric bacilli, predominantly E. coli . 1 Many other pathogens, however, including Staphylococcus aureus , coagulase-negative staphylococcal species, Viridans streptococci, E. coli , Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp. have recently emerged as significant pathogens for neonatal sepsis in the USA. 12 , 21 Among the culture-confirmed cases in the present study, Staphylococcus spp. including S. aureus were the most frequent pathogens, followed by Streptococcus and E. coli for early-onset sepsis, and by E. coli , Streptococcus and Candida spp. for late-onset sepsis. The low rate of group B Streptococcus , which is susceptible to many antibiotics, might reflect the extravagant use of antibiotics: intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis is commonly given in Korea in all cases of ROM, rather than waiting for 18 h as is recommended in the USA. The present observed incidence of late-onset sepsis due to Candida spp., 0.46 per 1000 live births, is lower than that in reports from Israel of 0.4–2 per 1000 live births. 22 Candida is especially a problem for infants cared for in intensive care units, where rates are considerably higher, ranging from 3.8% to 12.9% for VLBW infants, 22 accounting for 0.5–2.0% of neonatal intensive care unit admissions. Consistent with the literature, many of the infants’ mothers experienced prolonged ROM, and the proportions were higher among those with early-onset disease for both clinically diagnosed and culture-confirmed cases. 17 Also consistent with the literature, vaginal delivery was more common among early-onset sepsis than in late-onset sepsis cases in both proven and clinical sepsis. 23 In the present study urinary tract infection (46.0% in culture-confirmed, 18.9% in clinical) was the most common focal infection followed by meningitis, pneumonia, conjunctivitis, skin infection and omphalitis. Excluding pneumonia and meningitis, we found no difference in the distribution of focal infection type between late- and early-onset cases. The percent of focal infection (excluding pneumonia or meningitis), however, in late-onset sepsis was higher than that of early-onset sepsis in both culture-confirmed (24.6% vs 16.9%) and clinical sepsis (9.1% vs 3.9%). This is similar to previous studies that suggest that focal infection involving any organ (excluding pneumonia or meningitis), occurs most frequently in neonates with late-onset rather than early-onset disease. 1 Previous studies of culture-confirmed sepsis in Korea have reported higher case-fatality rates for neonatal sepsis than the 2.2% reported here: 24.3% in the 1960s, 8 15.2% in the 1970s, 24 21.9% 25 –27.8% in the 1980s 26 , and 17.1% in the 1990s. 10 Changes in case-fatality rates over time may reflect differences in patient populations or changes in environmental factors or medical practice. The estimated fatality rate for culture-confirmed sepsis, 2.2% (4/179), was lower than that reported for 1995–1997 in Spain, 8.7%, 15 and for 2002–2005 in Iran, 19.8%, 27 but for clinical sepsis the fatality rate of 4.7% (52/1100) is similar to the 4.3% 15 of the 1995–1997 Spain study. Differences among countries may reflect differences in host and environmental factors and medical practice. Although birthweight and Apgar score have been associated previously with risk of early onset neonatal sepsis, we found no earlier reports suggesting that they predict mortality. Gestational age is associated with birthweight and has been previously associated with mortality. We cannot rule out, however, that the infection led to premature labor and delivery, and hence the VLBW and young gestational age. Because the present study was retrospective we could not validate the exact cause for preterm delivery for all cases, nor if there were other conditions present in premature infants that might have increases risk of mortality such as hyaline membrane disease and intraventricular hemorrhage. Nonetheless, VLBW (?1500 g) and a lower Apgar scores 5 min after birth (?7) increased the fatality rate, by RR = 11.3 and RR = 6.8 respectively, thus it seems prudent to take rapid and decisive steps toward better management of this group whether the sepsis is clinically diagnosed or culture-confirmed.
