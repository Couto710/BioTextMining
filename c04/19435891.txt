Cell Cycle Regulation by MicroRNAs in Embryonic Stem Cells The cell cycle is tightly orchestrated during normal development. Embryonic stem (ES) cells have a unique cell cycle structure, where the G1/S restriction is largely absent enabling cells to rapidly move through G1 and enter S phase. This hastened cell cycle allows the early embryo to rapidly grow. Recent experiments suggest that small non-coding RNAs, the microRNAs, play a central role in achieving this unique cell cycle structure. The responsible microRNAs function by suppressing multiple inhibitors of the G1/S transition. Expression of these miRNAs drops dramatically as the ES cells differentiate and the G1 phase extends. Some of the same miRNAs are overexpressed in cancers where they can promote tumor growth suggesting common mechanisms of miRNA regulated cell cycle control in ES cells and cancers. This review discusses these recent findings in the context of broader knowledge of cell cycle control in normal and abnormal development.
