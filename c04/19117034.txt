Chemoimmunotherapy May Overcome the Adverse Prognostic Significance of 11q Deletion in Previously Untreated Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia BACKGROUND An 11q22 deletion is considered an independent factor predicting poor survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS We searched the electronic CLL database for consecutive patients who presented to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Department of Leukemia from October 2003 to April 2007 with untreated CLL and who had an 11q22 deletion, detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of bone marrow samples. FISH analysis was performed using the following probes: trisomy 12 (12p11.1-q11), TP53 (17p13.1), ATM (11q22.3), LAMP1 (13q34), and D13S319 loci (13q14.3). RESULTS Sixty-nine patients with untreated CLL with an 11q22 deletion were identified. The median patient age was 59 years (range, 26-81 years); 80% were men, 53% had Zubrod performance status >0, and 13% had Rai stage III to IV disease. Lymphadenopathy (massive), splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were present in 96% (12%), 19%, 9%, and 4%, respectively. In addition, 62% of patients had deletions in 13q, and 3% had trisomy 12. Forty patients required therapy for progressive disease. The overall response rates for FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab), CFAR (FCR plus alemtuzumab), and rituximab plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were 100%, 100%, and 33%, respectively. The 11q22 deletion was undetectable in 25 of 27 patients monitored after treatment using FISH analysis. The median follow-up was 17 months. At 1 and 3 years, the survival rates were 97% and 91%, respectively, and the relapse-free survival rates were 100% and 77%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS CLL with an 11q22 deletion was associated with high rates of response, survival, and relapse-free survival when treated with chemoimmunotherapy.  MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched the electronic CLL database for consecutive patients who presented to the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Department of Leukemia from October 2003 to April 2007 who had an 11q22 deletion, detected by FISH analysis. Patient records were reviewed for history, laboratory, and clinical findings at the time of presentation to M. D. Anderson Cancer Center; treatment; and clinical outcomes. A waiver of informed consent and a waiver of authorization were granted for this retrospective study by the institutional review board. Eight patients with an additional 17p deletion were excluded from the analysis. Cytogenetic Analysis Cytogenetic analyses were performed on whole bone marrow samples that had been obtained at presentation. FISH analysis was performed on bone marrow samples that had been maintained in culture without stimulation for 24 hours using the Vysis CLL probe panel (Vysis, Downers Grove, Ill) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The panel includes locus-specific probes to TP53 (17p13.1), ATM (11q22.3), S13S319 (13q14.3), LAMP1 (13q34), and the centromeric region of chromo-some 12 (12p11.1-q11). For each probe, 200 interphase nuclei were enumerated. By using the 95% confidence limit established for 10 normal controls, a sample was considered positive for del(11)(q22) if more than 5.6% of interphase nuclei showed a single signal. Acquisition or presence of mutations in the second allele of the ATM gene was not explored. Conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed on metaphase cells from samples that had been maintained in culture either without stimulation for 24 hours or stimulated with lipopolysaccharide for 72 hours, using standard Giemsa-banding techniques. Therapy Patients were treated systemically if they met the National Cancer Institute Working Group (NCI-WG) indications for therapeutic intervention in CLL. 16 Assignment to different treatments was determined after review of all clinical, laboratory, and pathologic data in a multidisciplinary conference, and it was also based on protocol availability. The attending physician discussed with the patient the available treatment options and the preferred treatment, but the final decision was made by the patient. treatment was administered either at our center or in the community by collaborating physicians. The evaluation of response for all patients who were included in the study was performed at M. D. Anderson. Signed informed consent was obtained before all procedures and before all experimental therapy, as required by the institutional review board. Endpoints and Statistical Methods The response criteria were those defined in 1996 by the NCI-WG. 17 A complete response (CR) required the disappearance of all palpable disease; the normalization of blood counts, with neutrophil counts >1.5 × 109/L, platelet counts >100 × 109/L, hemoglobin levels >11 g/dL, and bone marrow aspirate lymphocytes <30%; and no evidence of disease on bone marrow biopsy. A nodular partial response (PR) required the same criteria as a CR, with the exception that lymphoid nodules could be seen on bone marrow biopsy. A PR required a reduction of ?50% in palpable disease as well as ?1 of the following (without transfusions): neutrophil counts ?1.5 × 109/L or 50% improvement over baseline, platelet counts >100 × 109/L or 50% improvement over baseline, and hemoglobin levels >11.0 g/dL or 50% improvement over baseline. No bone marrow evaluation was required for determination of PR. Computed tomography (CT) scans for staging or response assessments were not performed. Survival was measured from the day of presentation at M. D. Anderson until death from any cause or last follow-up. For patients who responded to CLL therapy, relapse-free survival was defined as the time from response until disease progression or recurrence. Distributions of survival and time to disease progression were estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS 8.2 and SPLUS 2000 (Insightful Corporation, Seattle, Wash); P <.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

No bone marrow evaluation was required for determination of PR. Computed tomography (CT) scans for staging or response assessments were not performed. Survival was measured from the day of presentation at M. D. Anderson until death from any cause or last follow-up.

Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS 8.2 and SPLUS 2000 (Insightful Corporation, Seattle, Wash); P <.05 was considered to be statistically significant.  RESULTS Patient Characteristics Among 708 consecutive patients with untreated CLL analyzed using FISH, 69 (9.7%) had an 11q22 deletion without a deletion of 17p. Their clinical and laboratory findings at presentation are summarized in Table 1 . The median age was 59 years (range, 26-81 years). Eighty percent were men; 53% had Zubrod performance status >0. Nine patients (13%) had Rai stage III to IV disease. The median absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was 24.2 × 109/L (range, 2.1-513.0 × 109/L), and the median ALC doubling time was 237 days (25th and 75th percentile, 158 and 617 days, respectively). Seventy-four percent (34 of 46) of patients cells were zeta-associated protein-70 (ZAP-70)-positive, 61% (33 of 54) were CD38 positive, and 89% (39 of 44) had unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) genes. The median ?2-microglobulin level was 2.7 mg/dL (range, 1.3-8.8 mg/dL). Thirteen (19%) of 67 patients had a ?2-micro-globulin levels >4 mg/dL. FISH and Cytogenetic Analysis In the 69 patients (9.7%) with del(11)(q22) by FISH, but without a TP53 deletion, the proportion of cells that exhibited del(11)(q22) ranged from 9% to 98% (median, 53%; controls, <5.6%). Thirteen (19%) patients exhibited the deletion in 9% to 25% of cells, 17 (25%) in 26% to 50% of cells, 20 (29%) in 51% to 75% of cells, and 19 (28%) in >75% of cells. In addition to 11q22 deletions, 43 (62%) of 69 patients had 13q deletions, and 2 had trisomy 12. Conventional cytogenetic analysis demonstrated that 39 (57%) of 69 patients had normal karyotypes; 4 (6%) had a del(11)(q21q23), with or without other cyto-genetic abnormalities; 7 (10%) had del(11)(q13); 3 (4%) had a –Y abnormality; 8 (12%) had 1 of the following cytogenetic abnormalities, with or without additional chromosomal abnormalities: del(11)(q21), del(11)(q14q24), del(11)(q22.3), del(11)(q23), add(11)(q21), t(2;11), 11, and del(6)(q13q25); 2 (3%) had multiple chromosomal abnormalities, excluding chromosome 11; and 1 (1%) had insufficient metaphases. In 5 (7%) patients, no cytogenetic analysis was performed. Treatment and Response The median time from presentation at M. D. Anderson to treatment was 10.8 months (range, 0-28 months) and from diagnosis to treatment was 15 months (range, 1-97 months) ( Fig. 1A ). The median time from diagnosis to treatment was shorter in patients with abnormal (0.9 months) or unknown (0.9 months) conventional cytogenetics compared with patients whose cytogenetics were normal (17.3 months) ( P = .002) ( Fig. 1B ). Forty of the 69 patients required treatment for CLL. Indications for treatment were progressive lymphadenopathy in 17 (42.5%) patients, rapid ALC doubling time in 14 (35%), other symptomatic disease in 6 (15%), progressive splenomegaly in 2 (5%), and progressive thrombocytopenia and anemia in 1 (2.5%) patient. Because various protocols were available during this time period, patients were treated with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) 18 (n = 1); fludarabine, cyclo-phosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) 19 (n = 9); FCR plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (n = 9); FCR plus mitoxantrone (n = 3); FCR with high-dose rituximab (n = 8); FCR plus alemtuzumab (CFAR) (n = 6); rituximab plus GM-CSF 20 (n = 3); or rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CVP) (n = 1). Entry criteria differed in some of these clinical trials. For instance, eligibility criteria included 1) age <70 years and serum ?2-microglobulin ?4 mg/L for CFAR therapy; 2) age <70 years and serum ?2-microglobulin <4 mg/L for FCR plus mitoxantrone therapy; and 3) age >70 years for rituximab plus GMCSF therapy. Forty patients were evaluable for response to treatment. Response by regimen is shown in Table 2 . Of 40 responders, 35 patients had flow cytometric studies on bone marrow aspirates to evaluate residual disease at the time of response assessment. Fifteen (43%) patients had fewer than 1% CD5 and CD19 coexpressing cells (flow cytometry CR). Twelve (34%) had 1% to 5% coexpressing cells, and 8 (23%) had >5% CD5 and CD19 coex-pressing cells. The proportion of patients in CR with <1% CD5 and CD19 coexpressing cells was 50% (14 of 28), compared with 25% (1 of 4) of those in nodular PR and 0% (0 of 3) in PR. Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies by clone-specific polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed in 29 responders at the time of response assessment. In 12 patients there were no base pair changes identified in the Immunoglobulin H region, and therefore, they were similar to the germline sequence. Monoclonal IGHV gene rearrangements were undetectable in 6 of 17 (35%) patients and detectable in 8 (47%), and low levels of monoclonal IGHV gene rearrangements were detected in 3 (17%) patients. Monitoring by FISH The 11q22 deletion was undetectable in 25 of the 27 patients monitored by FISH analysis after treatment. Twenty-one of these 25 patients had attained a CR, and 4 had a nodular PR. One patient who developed Richter syndrome (RS) and another patient with relapsed CLL had recurrences of del(11)(q22); both patients were ZAP-70 positive and had unmutated IGHV genes. Survival The median follow-up of surviving patients was 17 months. At 1 and 3 years, the survival rates were 97% and 91%, respectively ( Fig. 1C ). Only 3 patients have died to date, including the patient with RS, who died from sepsis during therapy, 1 patient who died from pre-existing pancreatic cancer, and 1 patient who died from pre-existing glioblastoma multiforme. Relapse-free Survival The relapse-free survival rates at 1 and 3 years were 100% and 77%, respectively ( Fig. 1 day). Four patients had relapsed disease at 16, 17, 18, and 22 months. These patients had adverse prognostic features, such as ZAP-70-positive disease (3 of 3 patients tested), unmutated IGHV (2 of 2 patients tested), and elevated ?2-microglobulin levels (2.7 to 5.6 mg/dL, 4 of 4 patients). They had required treatment, which included FCR (n = 2), FCR plus mitox antrone (n = 1), or other (n = 1).

Anderson to treatment was 10.8 months (range, 0-28 months) and from diagnosis to treatment was 15 months (range, 1-97 months) ( Fig. 1A ). The median time from diagnosis to treatment was shorter in patients with abnormal (0.9 months) or unknown (0.9 months) conventional cytogenetics compared with patients whose cytogenetics were normal (17.3 months) ( P = .002) ( Fig. 1B ).

Because various protocols were available during this time period, patients were treated with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) 18 (n = 1); fludarabine, cyclo-phosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) 19 (n = 9); FCR plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (n = 9); FCR plus mitoxantrone (n = 3); FCR with high-dose rituximab (n = 8); FCR plus alemtuzumab (CFAR) (n = 6); rituximab plus GM-CSF 20 (n = 3); or rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CVP) (n = 1). Entry criteria differed in some of these clinical trials. For instance, eligibility criteria included 1) age <70 years and serum ?2-microglobulin ?4 mg/L for CFAR therapy; 2) age <70 years and serum ?2-microglobulin <4 mg/L for FCR plus mitoxantrone therapy; and 3) age >70 years for rituximab plus GMCSF therapy. Forty patients were evaluable for response to treatment. Response by regimen is shown in Table 2 . Of 40 responders, 35 patients had flow cytometric studies on bone marrow aspirates to evaluate residual disease at the time of response assessment. Fifteen (43%) patients had fewer than 1% CD5 and CD19 coexpressing cells (flow cytometry CR). Twelve (34%) had 1% to 5% coexpressing cells, and 8 (23%) had >5% CD5 and CD19 coex-pressing cells. The proportion of patients in CR with <1% CD5 and CD19 coexpressing cells was 50% (14 of 28), compared with 25% (1 of 4) of those in nodular PR and 0% (0 of 3) in PR. Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies by clone-specific polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed in 29 responders at the time of response assessment. In 12 patients there were no base pair changes identified in the Immunoglobulin H region, and therefore, they were similar to the germline sequence. Monoclonal IGHV gene rearrangements were undetectable in 6 of 17 (35%) patients and detectable in 8 (47%), and low levels of monoclonal IGHV gene rearrangements were detected in 3 (17%) patients.  Treatment and Response The median time from presentation at M. D. Anderson to treatment was 10.8 months (range, 0-28 months) and from diagnosis to treatment was 15 months (range, 1-97 months) ( Fig. 1A ). The median time from diagnosis to treatment was shorter in patients with abnormal (0.9 months) or unknown (0.9 months) conventional cytogenetics compared with patients whose cytogenetics were normal (17.3 months) ( P = .002) ( Fig. 1B ). Forty of the 69 patients required treatment for CLL. Indications for treatment were progressive lymphadenopathy in 17 (42.5%) patients, rapid ALC doubling time in 14 (35%), other symptomatic disease in 6 (15%), progressive splenomegaly in 2 (5%), and progressive thrombocytopenia and anemia in 1 (2.5%) patient. Because various protocols were available during this time period, patients were treated with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) 18 (n = 1); fludarabine, cyclo-phosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) 19 (n = 9); FCR plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (n = 9); FCR plus mitoxantrone (n = 3); FCR with high-dose rituximab (n = 8); FCR plus alemtuzumab (CFAR) (n = 6); rituximab plus GM-CSF 20 (n = 3); or rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CVP) (n = 1).

Monitoring by FISH The 11q22 deletion was undetectable in 25 of the 27 patients monitored by FISH analysis after treatment. Twenty-one of these 25 patients had attained a CR, and 4 had a nodular PR. One patient who developed Richter syndrome (RS) and another patient with relapsed CLL had recurrences of del(11)(q22); both patients were ZAP-70 positive and had unmutated IGHV genes.

Survival The median follow-up of surviving patients was 17 months. At 1 and 3 years, the survival rates were 97% and 91%, respectively ( Fig. 1C ). Only 3 patients have died to date, including the patient with RS, who died from sepsis during therapy, 1 patient who died from pre-existing pancreatic cancer, and 1 patient who died from pre-existing glioblastoma multiforme.

Only 3 patients have died to date, including the patient with RS, who died from sepsis during therapy, 1 patient who died from pre-existing pancreatic cancer, and 1 patient who died from pre-existing glioblastoma multiforme.  Relapse-free Survival The relapse-free survival rates at 1 and 3 years were 100% and 77%, respectively ( Fig. 1 day). Four patients had relapsed disease at 16, 17, 18, and 22 months. These patients had adverse prognostic features, such as ZAP-70-positive disease (3 of 3 patients tested), unmutated IGHV (2 of 2 patients tested), and elevated ?2-microglobulin levels (2.7 to 5.6 mg/dL, 4 of 4 patients). They had required treatment, which included FCR (n = 2), FCR plus mitox antrone (n = 1), or other (n = 1).

DISCUSSION Investigators have reported that an 11q deletion is an adverse prognostic factor in CLL. 15 , 21 Dohner and co-workers reported a median survival of 79 months in 56 patients with an 11q deletion. In particular, 53, 47, 43, and 33 patients in that series were alive at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. 15 Catovsky and coworkers found that an 11q deletion was associated with a CR plus nodular PR rate of 28%, and in addition to a 17p deletion and unmutated IGHV genes, was also an independent factor predicting shorter progression-free survival and poorer response to treatment. 21 In our retrospective analysis with limited patient follow-up, an 11q22 deletion appeared to be associated with a more favorable prognosis than originally reported. However, the issue of comparability between previously published data and our study cannot be addressed. That is, we cannot know whether the results can be attributed primarily to differences in treatment, follow-up time, or prognostic covariates rather than to the measurement of survival from the time of diagnosis in the study by Dohner et al 15 versus from the time of first visit at M. D. Anderson. In the current study, CLL with an 11q22 deletion was associated with prolonged survival (97% and 91% at 1 and 3 years, respectively) in all patients studied and in high rates of response and relapse-free survival in patients who required therapy. In particular, FCR-containing regimens resulted in a response rate of 100% (CR, 76%). In all patients, the relapse-free survival rate was 77% at 3 years. To date, only 4 patients, all of whom had poor-risk features such as unmutated IGHV gene rearrangements, ZAP-70 positivity, and/or high serum levels of ?2-micro-globulin, have had a relapse. Notably, 3 of these 4 patients had received FCR or FCR plus mitoxantrone . In addition, 2 of the 3 patient deaths were attributable to preexisting advanced malignancies. The proportion of patients with an 11q22 deletion in our series (9.7%) is within the range of that in other reports (6%-20%). 11 , 13 , 22 - 24 Other investigators have reported that as many as one-third of CLL cases have a deficiency of the ATM protein. 5 , 25 , 26 In our series, most patients had lymphadenopathy, as previously described. 11 However, bulky lymphadenopathy, defined as lymph nodes 5 cm or larger, was noted in only 12% of patients by physical examination, as baseline CT scans were not routinely performed. The median time from presentation at M. D. Anderson to first treatment in our series (10.8 months) is consistent with the 9 months reported in another series of 43 patients with an 11q deletion. 11 How-ever, in our series the time from CLL diagnosis to first treatment was >15 months. Interestingly, in our series with limited follow-up, an 11q22 deletion was associated with a more favorable prognosis than originally reported by Dohner et al (n = 56; median survival, 79 months; 53, 47, 43, and 33 patients alive at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively). 15 We have previously reported, using cytogenetic analysis, that an 11q deletion was associated with a prognosis similar to that of trisomy 12 in terms of survival (intermediate risk) and distinct from that of a 17p deletion. 27 This is in contrast to another report in which an 11q22 deletion was considered to have the same poor risk as a 17p deletion, and the 2 cytogenetic groups were merged for analysis. 28 The improved prognosis of patients with an 11q22 deletion in the current study can be at least partly attributed to more effective therapies used at our institution. Improvement in the survival of patients with CLL and an 11q deletion, as well as other poor prognostic characteristics, has also been reported with the use of allogeneic transplantation with reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. 29 The results of that study and the current study support the concept that prognosis depends on treatment, as more effective therapeutic strategies can overcome the adverse prognosis associated with some covariates. Interestingly, time to treatment was shorter in patients with abnormal cytogenetics, likely reflecting a higher tumor load and more advanced CLL in the abnormal cytogenetic group. Of note, the German group has reported results of a preliminary analysis demonstrating that patients with 11q deletion benefit particularly from fludarabine and cyclophosphamide combination therapy. Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide induced a response in 100% of patients compared with a 69% response rate with fludarabine alone (personal communication, Dr. Hartmut Dohner). Other investigators have reported that not only did patients with CLL and an ATM gene deletion have poorer survival than patients without an ATM deletion, but also that this difference was more striking in patients with mutated IGHV ( P = 0.01). 30 However, they found that ATM remained an independent factor predicting shorter survival after adjustment for IGHV mutational status. 30 Microarray gene expression profiling has identified several genes, in addition to the ATM gene, with reduced expression in patients with an 11q22-q23 deletion. 31 In another study, ATM was significantly underexpressed in CLL cells with high CD38 expression, suggesting that overexpression of ATM in CLL cells with low CD38 expression may be responsible for making these cells more susceptible to apoptosis in response to chemotherapy-induced DNA damage. 32 It was recently shown that the prognosis of patients with CLL and an 11q22 deletion depends on the integrity of the residual ATM allele. 33 Complete loss of ATM function was associated with a poor in vitro response to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and patients with loss of ATM function had poorer survival than patients with loss of only 1 ATM allele. 33 Our study is limited by the lack of testing for acquisition or presence of mutations in the second allele of the ATM gene, its retrospective nature, the short follow-up period, lack of a balanced cohort not receiving chemoimmunotherapy, and lack of a uniformly treated patient group. Although 87.5% (35 of 40) of patients were treated with an FCR-containing regimen, 4 patients were treated with immunotherapy (n = 3) or chemotherapy alone (n = 1), and 1 patient was treated with R-CVP. Caution is needed in the interpretation of the results, as some of our patients were treated on protocols based on their prognostic factors. For instance, our analysis does not suggest that FCR-GM-CSF is superior to FC without rituximab. Another weakness of our study is the lack of CT imaging for response assessment. Keeping in mind that during the study period, CT scans for response assessment were not required by the NCI-WG criteria, such studies would have been informative, particularly for measurement of lymphadenopathy. The recently revised NCI-WG CLL guidelines recommend the use of chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT scans to evaluate response in clinical trials where the treatment intent is to maximize response assessment. In conclusion, in this retrospective analysis of patients with previously untreated CLL, we found that an 11q22 deletion was associated with favorable clinical outcomes, despite the high incidence of other associated adverse prognostic factors, eg, ZAP-70, CD38, and unmutated IGHV gene status. Regimens that contain FCR appear to overcome the poor prognosis traditionally associated with this genetic abnormality. We, therefore, propose that patients with an 11q22 deletion should be treated with chemoimmunotherapy, including cyclophosphamide. Unlike patients with a 17p deletion, patients with an 11q22 deletion should not be considered to have adverse cytogenetics and a poor outcome. The cohort of patients included in this study will be expanded and followed for a longer period of time to establish the long-term effect of 11q22 deletion in a chemoimmunotherapy setting.
