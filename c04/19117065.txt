Tension Patterns of the Anteromedial and Posterolateral Grafts in a Double-Bundle Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction The two functional bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), namely, the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles, must work in concert to control displacement of the tibia relative to the femur for complex motions. Thus, the replacement graft(s) for a torn ACL should possess similar tension patterns. The objective of the study was to examine whether a double bundle ACL reconstruction with the semitendinosus-gracilis autografts could replicate the tension patterns of those for the intact ACL under controlled in vitro loading conditions. By means of a robotic/universal force moment sensor (UFS) testing system, the in situ force vectors (both magnitude and direction) for the AM and PL bundles of the ACL as well as their respective replacement grafts were determined and compared on nine human cadaveric knees. It was found that double bundle ACL reconstruction could closely replicate the in situ force vectors. Under a 134-N anterior tibial load, the resultant force vectors for the intact ACL and the reconstructed ACL had a difference of 5 to 11 N ( p >0.05) in magnitude and 1 to 13° ( p >0.05) in direction. Whereas, under combined rotatory loads of 10-N-m valgus and 5-N-m internal tibial torques, the corresponding differences were 10 to 16 N and 4 to 11°, respectively. Again, there were no statistically significant differences except at 30° of flexion where the force vector for the AM graft had a 15° ( p <0.05) lower elevation angle than did the AM bundle.  Introduction The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the major stabilizers of the knee joint, providing restraint to anterior tibial translation as well as to varus-valgus and axial tibial rotations. It has an irregular cross-sectional shape along its length and can be anatomically divided into two functional bundles, namely, the anteromedial (AM) and the posterolateral (PL) bundles, 1 , 2 each playing different roles in stabilizing the knee joint. When the knee is extended, both bundles are taut. As the knee is flexed, the AM bundle further tightens and the PL bundle becomes relatively lax. Biomechanical studies have further revealed that under an applied anterior tibial load, the PL bundle shares the load with the AM bundle near full knee extension; whereas, the AM bundle carries more load as knee flexion angle increases. 3 As a major knee stabilizer, the ACL is also the most frequently injured ligament during sports activities, 4 , 5 such as basketball, skiing, soccer, and football. A torn ACL may result in knee instability if left untreated. Due to its poor healing capability, surgeons often perform ACL reconstruction using replacement tissue grafts. Recently, the literature has been shown that under controlled in vitro tests simulating clinical exams (e.g., anterior tibial drawer/Lachman test and pivot shift test), these procedures which were designed chiefly to replace only the AM bundle can successfully limit anterior tibial translation under anterior tibial load, but become insufficient under rotator loads. 6 , 7 These findings have contributed to the renewed interest in using two separate grafts to replace both the AM and PL bundles of the ACL, 8 hence the term double bundle ACL reconstruction. Adding a more posteriorly and laterally placed PL graft could help to control knee rotation, especially when it is near full extension. 3 Double bundle ACL reconstruction procedures are still relatively new; and the longer-term clinical outcome data are not yet available. As such, many questions still exist regarding the surgical procedures, such as tunnel placement, fixation method, and initial graft tension, and so on. For effective restoration of the ACL function, the replacement grafts should possess tension patterns close to those for the two intact bundles, meaning a reproduction of the in situ force vectors. Thus, a restoration of both the magnitude and the direction of the in situ forces is crucial as they will ultimately impact the knee joint kinematics. 9 One recent study has found that following a traditional single bundle ACL reconstruction, the directions of the in situ forces for the ACL graft was significantly different from those of the intact ACL, with greater elevation and deviation angles for all knee flexion angles tested. 10 Thus, the objective of the present study was to examine the tension patterns in the AM and PL grafts following a double bundle ACL reconstruction, in order to address the research question whether their in situ force vectors could replicate those for the corresponding bundles of the intact ACL. As a double bundle ACL reconstruction could better replicate the attachment sites of an intact ACL, it was hypothesized that a double bundle ACL reconstruction could closely reproduce the in situ force vectors in the two functional bundles of the intact ACL, under controlled in vitro loading conditions. By means of a robotic/universal force moment sensor (UFS) testing system, the in situ force vectors for the two bundles of the intact ACL and their respective replacement grafts in response to an anterior tibial load and a combined rotatory load were measured from full extension through 120° of flexion, such that the magnitude and the direction of these force vectors obtained from the same knees could be compared.  Materials and Methods Nine fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees (45±14 years of age) were tested on a robotic/UFS testing system (robot: PUMA 726, Unimate Inc, Danbury, CT; load cell: model 4015, JR3 Inc, Woodland, CA). 11 The robotic manipulator has a position and orientation repeatability of 0.2 mm and 0.2°, respectively; and the UFS has a force and moment repeatability of 0.2 N and 0.01 N-m, respectively. The robotic/UFS testing system can be operated in three control modes: force control, position control, and hybrid control of both. In the force control mode, the robotic manipulator applies a specified force vector to a joint and measure the resulting 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) joint kinematics. In the position control mode, it does the opposite. Specimens were examined for osteoarthritis, bony abnormalities, and ACL integrity, using roentgenograms and arthroscopy. They were stored in airtight plastic bags at -20°C and were thawed at room temperature 24 hours before testing. In preparation, the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were harvested. Then, all soft tissue was removed approximately 10 cm away from the joint line on both the femur and the tibia, while the knee joint was left intact. The exposed tibia and femur were each coated with an epoxy compound (Fibre Glass-Evercoat, Cincinnati, Ohio) into a cylindrical shape, for secure mounting in custom-made aluminum clamps. The femoral side was rigidly mounted to the base of the robotic manipulator, while the tibial side was attached to the robot end-effector via the UFS. Throughout the experiment, the knees were kept moist with 0.9% saline solution. The robotic/UFS testing system first found the passive path of an intact knee from full extension (FE) to 120° of flexion (i.e., the neutral positions of the tibia when it flexes or extends) by flexing the tibia with minimal external forces being applied in all 6 DOF, which was achieved by an iterative algorithm in the custom-programmed robot control software. The robot manipulator was then operated under the force-control mode, applying two external loads in turn to each knee: (1) a 134-N anterior tibial load with the knee at full extension, 15°, 30°, 45°, 90° and 120° of flexion, and (2) a combined rotatory load of 10-N-m valgus torque and 5-N-m internal tibial torque at 15° and 30° of flexion. The two loading conditions were to simulate the anterior drawer test (or the Lachman test) and the pivot shift test, respectively. Under each loading condition, the resulting 5-DOF kinematics of the intact knee joint (i.e., anterior-posterior, medial-lateral, and proximal-distal translations, as well as internal-external and varus-valgus rotations) were recorded. The AM bundle and the PL bundle of the ACL were then separated and dissected consecutively in a random order, which in turn led to an AM or PL bundle deficient knee state and an ACL deficient knee state. Under each knee state, the kinematics recorded previously on the intact knee joint was replayed by the robotic/UFS testing system in the position-control mode. The resulting external forces were measured. Due to structural differences, these forces were different under each knee state of the same kinematics. The vectorial differences between them represented the in situ force vectors in the AM and PL bundles and the whole ACL, based on the principle of superposition. Double bundle reconstruction was performed using two femoral tunnels at the centers of the footprints of the AM and PL bundles and one tibial tunnel at the center of the tibial footprint. Autogenous semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were looped and used for the AM and PL grafts, respectively. Recently, our research center reported that knee flexion angles for graft fixation had an impact on force distribution between the two grafts in an anatomic double bundle ACL reconstruction. 12 , 13 It was found that there was an optimal range of knee flexion angles for fixing each graft in order not to overload the grafts. Specifically, it was found that fixing the AM and the PL bundles at 45° and 15° of knee flexion, respectively (i.e., fixation protocol 45°/15°), could more closely restored the magnitude of the resultant in situ force in the grafts to that in the intact ACL. Therefore, the fixation protocol 45°/15° was adopted in the present study. Each graft was fixed while a 67-N posterior tibial load and a 22-N of initial graft tension were maintained by the robot manipulator and a hand-held spring scale, respectively. Previous studies have shown that applying a 67-N of posterior load during the fixation of the grafts can more closely restore the knee kinematics and the in situ force in the ACL graft to those of the intact knee. 14 The initial graft tension was chosen according to a previous publication, which determined that in a single bundle ACL reconstruction, an initial graft tension of 44 N was enough to restore the knee kinematics without over-constraining the knee joint. 15 Therefore, a 22-N initial graft tension was applied to each graft, which totaled 44 N. The order of graft fixation was randomized among knees. The femoral fixation was an EndoButton® CL and the tibial fixation was a spiked washer and a screw. After reconstruction, the same two external loading conditions were applied to obtain the in situ force vectors in the grafts. An in situ force vector, F , was composed of three spatial components in the anterior-posterior ( F AP ), medial-lateral ( F ML ), and proximal-distal ( F PD ) directions, respectively. The magnitude of the force vector was obtained as (1) F = F A P 2 + F M L 2 + F P D 2 The resultant in situ forces for the intact ACL and the replacement ACL are the vector resultants of the forces for the intact AM and PL bundles and the AM and PL replacement grafts, respectively. The direction of the force vector was designated by an elevation angle ? (between the force vector and the tibial plateau) and a deviation angle ? (between the projection of the force vector on the tibial plateau and the mid-sagittal plane, designated positive towards the lateral direction and negative towards the medial direction) in a spherical coordinate system illustrated in Fig. 1 . 16 The elevation and deviation angles were calculated as follows (2) ? = sin ? 1 ( F P D F ) (3) ? = tan ? 1 ( F M L F A P ) It should be noted that the magnitude and the direction of an in situ force vector are of different data types and therefore, must be analyzed by different statistical analysis methods. The force magnitude is of linear data type and thus, a paired t -test was used to compare the arithmetic mean values at each knee flexion angle before and after reconstruction. In comparison, the force direction, represented by pairs of ( ? , ? ), falls under directional data type, 17 or more specifically spherical data type. 18 Conventional ways of calculating mean and testing hypothesis are not applicable for spherical data. Instead, the mean directions of the force vectors in the intact AM and PL bundles and the replacement grafts were calculated using the spherical data analysis method and were compared using an F -test for spherical data. 17 In both the t -test and the F -test, the significance level was set at 0.05. Based on our historical data, a power analysis was performed to determine the sample size prior to the experiment. It was determined that 9 samples are needed in order to detect a significant difference of 20 N in force magnitude and 7° in force direction with 80% power. As it is difficult to determine how accurate a reconstruction needs to be in terms of load carrying and angular differences from a normal ACL to avoid failure, the effect sizes chosen (20 N and 7° degrees) were arbitrary, and they were mainly based on our experiences with the robotic/UFS testing system. Also calculated were the angular distances between the force vector in an ACL bundle and that in its replacement graft, which were defined as the angles between the two force vectors. The angular distances gave direct indication of how well a replacement graft matched an intact bundle in restoring the direction of the in situ force vectors. The smaller the angular distance, the better a graft reproduces the direction of the in situ force.  Results Anterior tibial load In response to a 134-N anterior tibial load, the magnitude of the in situ forces for the AM bundle ranged from 46 ± 25 N (mean±SD) at full extension to 79 ± 21 N at 45° of knee flexion. The corresponding values for the AM graft matched well with that of the AM bundle (45 ± 26 to 74 ± 25 N, respectively, p > 0.05). Similar results were found for the PL bundle (from 12 ± 11 N at 90° to 52 ± 15 N at 15° of knee flexion), which were comparable with those for the PL graft (13 ± 11 to 57 ± 36 N, respectively, p > 0.05) throughout the range of knee motion tested. The directions of the in situ force vectors are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 . The elevation angle of the force vector for the AM bundle was found to be the greatest (29 ± 14°) when the knee was at full extension and it decreased to 14 ± 11° as the knee flexed to 120°. In the mean time, the deviation angle remained nearly unchanged (7 to 12°) throughout the range of flexion. Following double bundle reconstruction, the elevation angle of the force vector for the AM graft also decreased from 35 ± 20° to 18 ± 15° with knee flexion, while the deviation angle remained relatively unchanged (5 ± 9° to 11 ± 20°). No statistical difference could be found in directions between the force vector for the AM graft and that for the AM bundle ( p > 0.05). The angular distance between the two force vectors was very small for all the knee flexion angles tested, ranging from 1° to 6°. Since both the PL graft and the PL bundle became more lax when the knee flexed past 30°, the directions of the force vectors were calculated only at full extension, 15° and 30°. For the PL bundle, the angles varied from 17 ± 11° to 20 ± 10° for the elevation angle and remained nearly constant for the deviation angle (about 7°). This was also the case for the PL graft (24 ± 8° to 20 ± 7° and 6 ± 8° to 11 ± 7°, respectively). The angular distance between the force vectors for the PL graft and those for the PL bundle ranged from 3° to 7°. Again, no statistical difference in direction was found ( p > 0.05). The magnitude of the resultant in situ force vectors for the intact ACL and the replacement ACL are shown in Table 1 . The difference in magnitude of the in situ force between the intact ACL and the replacement ACL ranged from 5 N at full extension to 11 N at 120° of knee flexion ( p >0.05), while the angular distance was the largest (13°, p >0.05) at full extension and reduced to less than 7° ( p >0.05) for the remaining flexion angles tested (see Fig. 4 ). Combined rotatory load Under a combined rotatory load of 10-N-m valgus and 5-N-m internal tibial torques, the AM and PL bundles shared the load at 15° of knee flexion (41 ± 15 N and 42 ± 22 N, respectively), as did the AM and PL grafts (39 ± 18 N and 37 ± 16 N, respectively) (see Table 2 ). When the knee was flexed to 30°, the AM bundle and the AM graft were slightly more loaded than their counterparts by 3 to 11 N. No statistical difference was found in the magnitude of the in situ forces between the grafts and their respective intact bundles ( p >0.05). The direction of the force vector for the AM graft was found to be significantly different from that for the AM bundle at 30° of flexion (35 ± 15° elevation and -2 ± 15° deviation vs. 20 ± 9° elevation and 0 ± 9° deviation, p =0.01) (see Table 2 ). The corresponding angular distance was 16° (Fig. 5). On the contrary, the directions of the force vectors for the PL graft were comparable to those for the PL bundle at both 15° and 30° of knee flexion ( p >0.05) ( Table 3 ), with an angular distance of 4° and 8°, respectively. For the resultant in situ forces for the intact ACL and the replacement ACL, the results are listed in Table 4 . The differences in magnitude were 10 N and 16 N at 15° and 30° of flexion, respectively ( p >0.05). The corresponding angular distance was 4° and 11°. At 30° of flexion, the directions of the in situ forces were found to be statistically different ( p =0.03).  Results Anterior tibial load In response to a 134-N anterior tibial load, the magnitude of the in situ forces for the AM bundle ranged from 46 ± 25 N (mean±SD) at full extension to 79 ± 21 N at 45° of knee flexion.

Discussion In this study, a unique device, namely, the robotic/UFS testing system with high position and orientation repeatability, made it possible to measure the in situ force vectors of the ACL and the ACL graft (i.e., before and after ACL reconstruction) from the same specimen. In this way, the data obtained are paired and thus significantly increased the statistical power of the data. Further, direct vision of the footprints during surgery eliminated the possibility of tunnel malpositioning, and thus minimized one source of variation, aside from the inevitable large inter-specimen variations in anatomy and structure. As a result, the tension patterns, in terms of the magnitude and directions of the in situ force vectors, for the AM and PL grafts following a double bundle ACL reconstruction performed with the semitendinosus-gracilis autografts could be obtained with higher fidelity and compared directly with those for the AM and PL bundles of the intact ACL. In the majority of the cases tested, including 2 loading conditions at various knee flexion angles, the force vectors were found to be comparable in general with no statistical difference. Thus, the tension patterns for the ACL replacement grafts were close to those for the intact bundles. The findings of this study supported the hypothesis and indeed answered the research question, because we were able to compare the individual tension patterns of the AM and PL graft with the respective ACL bundles. Under a 134-N anterior tibial load, the resultant in situ force vector in the replacement ACL was similar to that of the intact ACL throughout the range of knee motion tested, with a difference in magnitude of 5 to 11 N and an angular distance of maximum 13° at full extension and 1 to 7° in other angles of knee flexion. Their differences were considerably less than those reported for the case of a traditional single bundle ACL reconstruction where the in situ force vectors for the ACL graft differed from those for the intact ACL by as much as 4 to 28 N in magnitude and 10 to 22° in direction between full extension and 90° of flexion (see Fig. 6). 10 This finding is consistent with reported results that double bundle ACL reconstruction can restore knee kinematics closer to the intact values than can a single bundle ACL reconstruction under the same in vitro loading conditions. 3 Under a combined rotatory load of 10-N-m valgus and 5-N-m internal tibial torques, there was a significant difference of 11° in angular distance between the direction of the resultant in situ force for the replacement ACL and that for the intact ACL at 30° of knee flexion. The difference was due to the AM graft in particular, as its in situ force had a different elevation angle than did the AM bundle of the intact ACL. The corresponding angular difference in force direction between the AM graft and the AM bundle was 16°. Such a difference might be attributed to the anatomical and structural dissimilarities that still exist between the AM bundle and the AM graft, such as graft properties, graft tensions, and the relative contribution between AM and PL grafts at this particular angle of knee flexion. It must be emphasized that the data on the magnitude and the direction of an in situ force vector belong to different data categories for statistical analysis. The former is a linear data set while the latter is a spherical data set expressed in the elevation and deviation angles. In this study, we have employed spherical data analysis method to calculate and compare the directions of the in situ forces. The interested readers are referred to relevant texts for additional details. 11 , 12 Several limitations existed for the present study. First, the load levels applied to the knee joint only reflected those seen in an anterior tibial drawer test and a pivot shift test, which are commonly used by orthopaedic surgeons to evaluate knee joint laxity and to assess soft tissue injuries about the knee. Second, the tension pattern of the ACL grafts in the reconstructed knee was evaluated immediately after surgery and thus, could only represent time zero data. In the postoperative healing process, the grafts could undergo substantial changes and as a result, the in situ force vector for the AM and PL grafts will undergo changes. Finally, the method of placing grafts in the middle of the footprint of each bundle immediately after dissection represented the best case scenario for graft placement and did not simulate the “real case” (ACL-injured patients) where footprints are either gone or obscured by scarring, which will likely impact the reconstruction results in terms of restoring the in situ force vectors. Nevertheless, this study clearly demonstrated how the AM and PL grafts in a double bundle ACL reconstruction could reproduce these force vectors of the AM and PL bundles of the intact ACL to stabilize the knee joint under controlled in vitro loading conditions. The analyses on both the magnitude and the direction of the in situ force vectors gives a more complete description of the tension patterns of the intact ACL for evaluation of new surgical procedures.  Discussion In this study, a unique device, namely, the robotic/UFS testing system with high position and orientation repeatability, made it possible to measure the in situ force vectors of the ACL and the ACL graft (i.e., before and after ACL reconstruction) from the same specimen. In this way, the data obtained are paired and thus significantly increased the statistical power of the data. Further, direct vision of the footprints during surgery eliminated the possibility of tunnel malpositioning, and thus minimized one source of variation, aside from the inevitable large inter-specimen variations in anatomy and structure. As a result, the tension patterns, in terms of the magnitude and directions of the in situ force vectors, for the AM and PL grafts following a double bundle ACL reconstruction performed with the semitendinosus-gracilis autografts could be obtained with higher fidelity and compared directly with those for the AM and PL bundles of the intact ACL. In the majority of the cases tested, including 2 loading conditions at various knee flexion angles, the force vectors were found to be comparable in general with no statistical difference. Thus, the tension patterns for the ACL replacement grafts were close to those for the intact bundles. The findings of this study supported the hypothesis and indeed answered the research question, because we were able to compare the individual tension patterns of the AM and PL graft with the respective ACL bundles.
