Evidence for two independent prostate cancer risk associated loci in the HNF1B gene at 17q12 A fine mapping study in the HNF1B gene at 17q12 among two study populations revealed a second prostate cancer locus, ~26 kb centromeric to the first known locus (rs4430796); these are separated by a recombination hotspot. A SNP in the second locus (rs11649743) was confirmed in five additional populations, and P =1.7Ã—10?9 for an allelic test in the seven combined studies. The association at each SNP remains significant after adjusting for the other SNP.
