The Use of Short Tandem Repeat Profiling To Characterize Human Bladder Cancer Cell Lines Purpose Cross-contamination of cell lines is a serious but often unrecognized problem. We describe the authentication of a panel of transitional cell carcinoma cell lines using the short tandem repeat (STR) profiling technique to detect cross-contamination. Methods Genomic DNA was isolated from UM-UC-1, UM-UC-2, UM-UC-3, UM-UC-6, UM-UC-9, UM-UC-10, UM-UC-11, UM-UC-13, UM-UC-14, UM-UC-16, T24, and KU7 cell lines. STR loci (D3S1358, D16S539, vWA, FGA, TH01, TPOX, CSF1PO, D5S818, D13S317, and D7S820) and a segment of the X-Y homologous gene amelogenin were co-amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Profiling was carried out using a performance optimized polymer 4 (POP-4TM) with ABI PRISM1 310 genetic analyzer. DNA sequencing of TP53 and immunohistochemistry for p53 were performed on UM-UC-3 and UM-UC-3-green fluorescence protein (GFP). Results All cell lines had a unique STR profile except UM-UC-2 and T24, which were virtually identical. T24 STR profiles matched those of early passage number UM-UC-2. Stable transfection of the GFP marker gene did not alter UM-UC-6, UM-UC-14, or KU7 profiles; however, the STR profile for UM-UC-3-GFP was different from that of UM-UC-3. DNA sequencing showed a difference in TP53 between UM-UC-3 and UM-UC-3-GFP, confirming that UM-UC-3-GFP is not derived from UM-UC-3. Conclusion STR profiling provides a unique genetic signature of human cell lines that does not significantly change with passage or GFP transduction. Through STR profiling, we showed that the cell line UM-UC-2 is T24. DNA fingerprinting using STR profiling is an easy and reliable tool that can be used for verification of cell lines.

Material and Methods Cell Culture The transitional cell carcinoma cell lines UM-UC-1, UM-UC-2, UM-UC-3, UM-UC-6, UM-UC-9, UM-UC-10, UM-UC-11, UM-UC-13, UM-UC-14, UM-UC-16, T24 and KU7 were obtained from cryopreserved cells frozen over a span of more than 25 years. UM-UC-3 was also obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were maintained in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA, USA) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2. Cells were passed with 0.25% trypsin in Hanks media (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) when confluent. All cultures were free of bacterial, fungal, and mycoplasma contamination. DNA Extraction and Sequencing Genomic DNA was isolated from 2 × 106 cells using a QIAamp DNA mini kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). One nanogram of DNA for each cell line was used for STR profiling. DNA concentration was determined by light absorption at 260 nm. DNA samples from the cell lines were also sent for sequence analysis for the TP53 gene. STR Amplification and Typing Short tandem repeat loci and a segment of the X-Y homologous gene amelogenin were amplified using the AmpF l STR Profiler Plus (detecting D3S1358, vWA, FGA, TH01, TPOX, CSF1PO, D5S818, D13S317, and D7S820 loci and amelogenin) and COfiler (detecting D3S1358, D16S539, TH01, TPOX, CSF1PO, and D7S820 loci) PCR amplification kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers’ instructions in the GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems). Electrophoretic analysis was carried out using a performance optimized polymer 4 (POP-4TM; Applied Biosystems) with ABI PRISM1 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The amplified DNA fragment lengths were determined by comparing them with an internal size standard GeneScanTM-500 ROX (Applied Biosystems). Each electrophoretic run was analyzed with the GeneScan Analysis software v.3.1.2 (Applied Biosystems) and compared with AmpF l STR1Profiler Plus allelic ladders (Applied Biosystems). Each experiment was repeated at least once. Immunohistochemical Staining of p53 UM-UC-6 (wild-type for p53 by sequencing and p53 negative by immunohistochemical [IHC]) analysis and UM-UC-14 (mutation for p53 by sequencing and p53 positive by IHC) were controls for immunohistochemistry. Primary anti-p53 antibodies (clone PAb 240 or clone PAb 1801) were used at a dilution of 1:200. The 240 antibody detects only mutant p53 protein, whereas the 1801 antibody detects wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) p53 proteins. Cultured cells were grown on sterile glass slides overnight at 37º C. The slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 5 minutes in -10º C methanol. After washing in PBS, the slides were incubated for 5 to 10 minutes in 0.1% to 1% hydrogen peroxide in PBS to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. The slides were blocked using 1% serum in PBS for 30 minutes before overnight incubation at 4oC, with each primary antibody diluted 1:200 in blocking solution. Primary antibodies were detected using their respective ABC Elite kits (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California). Color was developed with diaminobenzidine, and the sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. Using antibody 1801, p53 scoring was reported as no expression (?) or overexpression (+++), presumably representing a mutant form of the protein. Staining with antibody 240 was considered to indicate the presence of a mutant p53 protein.  Cell Culture The transitional cell carcinoma cell lines UM-UC-1, UM-UC-2, UM-UC-3, UM-UC-6, UM-UC-9, UM-UC-10, UM-UC-11, UM-UC-13, UM-UC-14, UM-UC-16, T24 and KU7 were obtained from cryopreserved cells frozen over a span of more than 25 years.

Results Each of the 12 urothelial carcinoma cell lines were analyzed by STR profiling at 2 to 5 different passages. The DNA fingerprinting profiles are shown in Figures 1 to 4 . When we compared the cell line STR profiles, we found that UM-UC-2 and T24 cell lines had essentially identical profiles ( Fig.1 ). This finding has been independently verified by the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK). T24 STR profiles matched those of both early and intermediate passage number UM-UC-2, demonstrating that UM-UC-2 was contaminated with T24 at an early stage. The STR profiles of the other cell lines were distinct from each other ( Fig. 2 ). Within each cell line, there was at least 90% concordance in their respective profiles at different passages. Examples of STR profiles at different passages are shown in Figures 1 and 4 . Differences in heights of peaks at various loci were commonly seen at different passages. Several of the cell lines had previously been transduced with the GFP marker gene. 15 Transduction of UM-UC-6, UM-UC-14, and KU7 with GFP did not alter their STR profiles. The KU7 and KU7-GFP STR profiles are shown in Figure 3 . We found a marked discordance between the STR profiles of UM-UC-3 and UM-UC-3-GFP ( Fig. 4 ). To ascertain whether gene transduction altered the STR profile, we examined the TP53 status of UM-UC-3, which has described as having large deletions among exons 5/6 in TP53. 14 In contrast to our previous report, DNA sequencing analysis for the p53 gene in UM-UC-3 from our laboratory and from the ATCC demonstrated that it is wild-type for exons 5–9 but has a missense substitution in exon 4, base substitution in exon 11, non-coding deletion in exon 9, and a non-coding deletion and substitution in intron 9. These features are also different from those of UM-UC-3-GFP, which only had a frameshift deletion in position 39 of exon 5, demonstrating that UM-UC-3-GFP is contaminated ( Fig. 5 ). Furthermore, UM-UC-3 in contrast to our previous report demonstrates strong staining for p53 by immunochemical analysis using the 1801 and the 240 antibodies ( Fig. 6 ). 14 We also previously reported large deletions among exons 5/6 of TP53 in UM-UC-16. 14 On reanalysis of this cell line, we found only a 7-bp frameshift deletion in exons 5 and 6 and a missense mutation in exon 4. In this study, we used 2 PCR amplification kits to determine the gene signature of the cell lines: the AmpF l STR Profiler Plus (which detects 9 loci) and the COfiler (which detects 6 loci). Both kits detect 5 similar loci. We found that detecting only 6 loci (using the COfiler kit) was sufficient to determine the identity of the cell lines.  Results Each of the 12 urothelial carcinoma cell lines were analyzed by STR profiling at 2 to 5 different passages. The DNA fingerprinting profiles are shown in Figures 1 to 4 . When we compared the cell line STR profiles, we found that UM-UC-2 and T24 cell lines had essentially identical profiles ( Fig.1 ). This finding has been independently verified by the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK). T24 STR profiles matched those of both early and intermediate passage number UM-UC-2, demonstrating that UM-UC-2 was contaminated with T24 at an early stage. The STR profiles of the other cell lines were distinct from each other ( Fig. 2 ). Within each cell line, there was at least 90% concordance in their respective profiles at different passages. Examples of STR profiles at different passages are shown in Figures 1 and 4 . Differences in heights of peaks at various loci were commonly seen at different passages. Several of the cell lines had previously been transduced with the GFP marker gene. 15 Transduction of UM-UC-6, UM-UC-14, and KU7 with GFP did not alter their STR profiles. The KU7 and KU7-GFP STR profiles are shown in Figure 3 . We found a marked discordance between the STR profiles of UM-UC-3 and UM-UC-3-GFP ( Fig. 4 ). To ascertain whether gene transduction altered the STR profile, we examined the TP53 status of UM-UC-3, which has described as having large deletions among exons 5/6 in TP53. 14 In contrast to our previous report, DNA sequencing analysis for the p53 gene in UM-UC-3 from our laboratory and from the ATCC demonstrated that it is wild-type for exons 5–9 but has a missense substitution in exon 4, base substitution in exon 11, non-coding deletion in exon 9, and a non-coding deletion and substitution in intron 9. These features are also different from those of UM-UC-3-GFP, which only had a frameshift deletion in position 39 of exon 5, demonstrating that UM-UC-3-GFP is contaminated ( Fig. 5 ). Furthermore, UM-UC-3 in contrast to our previous report demonstrates strong staining for p53 by immunochemical analysis using the 1801 and the 240 antibodies ( Fig. 6 ). 14 We also previously reported large deletions among exons 5/6 of TP53 in UM-UC-16. 14 On reanalysis of this cell line, we found only a 7-bp frameshift deletion in exons 5 and 6 and a missense mutation in exon 4. In this study, we used 2 PCR amplification kits to determine the gene signature of the cell lines: the AmpF l STR Profiler Plus (which detects 9 loci) and the COfiler (which detects 6 loci). Both kits detect 5 similar loci. We found that detecting only 6 loci (using the COfiler kit) was sufficient to determine the identity of the cell lines.  Discussion It has been reported that 17% to 36% of cell cultures in use are cross-contaminated either by intraspecies contamination (unrelated cells from the same species) or interspecies contamination (cells from another species). 1 Quality control for cell line cross-contamination is not regularly practiced in most laboratories, despite the obvious importance and frequency of the problem. This may be due to several factors, including: (1) failure to appreciate the occurrence of cross-contamination because it is often not visually recognizable, (2) unsuitability of detection methods for extensive cell-culture screening, and (3) lack of awareness of cross-contamination due to insufficient reporting [1]. Cell lines derived from urinary bladder carcinomas have frequently been found to be cross-contaminated with T24 cells. 16 - 19 The ECV304 cell line, which was widely considered a model cell line for endothelial cells, has also been reported to be a subclone of the T24 cell line. 20 Here, we also describe another bladder cancer cell line, UM-UC-2, which is actually T24 due to cross-contamination at the source. The STR profiling technique uses fluorescence-based PCR and multiple dye technology to enable detection of loci with overlapping size ranges. This technique was developed to identify people for forensic purposes. 10 Using this method, various polymorphic STR loci are amplified by PCR using commercial primers. The PCR products are then read against size standards by automated fluorescence detectors. The accuracy of this PCR technique is less than 1 bp. 2 STR profiling has been investigated for its use in detecting cell line cross-contamination. It was shown to provide an efficient, rapid, and reliable means of authenticating cell lines. 2 In a study that used this technique to evaluate cell lines obtained worldwide, STR profiling was also shown to provide a universal standard reference for human cell lines. 2 In our study, 1ng of DNA was able to provide sufficient peak heights to evaluate the specific loci. Differences seen in peak heights within cell lines may be due to differential amplification efficiency of the loci, experimental variation, or the number of allele copies present. In normal human DNA, most STR loci have 2 alleles; however, the STR loci in cancer cells may have additional copies of the allele, due to genetic instability. Although it has been reported that long-term cultures and sub-cloning may result in alterations of DNA fingerprinting profiles that are divergent from their parental origin 21 , we have not verified this observation. UM-UC-3 cells were stable from different sources obtained over a period of more than 25 years. Some investigators have found that viral transformation or long-term exposure to chemotherapeutic agents may produce sublines that have different STR profiles 2 but tend to remain similar to the parental cell line. The finding that UM-UC-2 was contaminated led us to reassess our previously reported cell lines. We found that UM-UC-3-GFP was also contaminated and had a markedly different STR profile than did UM-UC-3. This was confirmed by significant differences in TP53 mutation in the 2 cell lines. The other human bladder cancer cell lines had unique STR profiles that did not change with passage or GFP transduction. The STR profiles of our cell lines are summarized in Table 1 . We also found differences in TP53 of UM-UC-3 and UM-UC-16 cells, and in IHC for p53 of UM-UC-3 compared to our prior report. 14 We found that using 6-loci detection screening (D3S1358, D16S539, TH01, TPOX, CSF1PO, and D7S820) was sufficient for authenticating our cell lines. While this approach is more cost effective for screening cell lines, additional confirmation can be obtained by 10-loci screening. The profiles reported here can be used to verify the identity of our cell lines. These cell lines have been made available to non-commercial investigators through the ATCC and the ECACC.

Conclusion STR profiling provides a unique genetic signature of human cell lines that does not change with passage or GFP transduction. We demonstrated through STR profiling, that UM-UC-2 is actually T24, due apparently to cross-contamination shortly after establishment of the cell line. STR profiling also demonstrated that UM-UC-3-GFP is not related to UM-UC-3. Investigators should be aware of the continuing problem of cell line cross-contamination. Our results demonstrate that DNA fingerprinting using a 6-loci STR profiling technique is an easy and reliable tool that can be used to identify cell lines.
