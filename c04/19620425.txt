Imaging of Tumor Angiogenesis: Functional or Targeted? OBJECTIVE Angiogenesis—the growth of new vessels—is both a normal physiologic response and a critical step in many pathologic processes, particularly cancer. Imaging has long relied on the different enhancement characteristics of cancer compared with normal tissue; the information generated is often primarily morphologic and qualitative. However, more quantitative methods based on functional and targeted imaging have recently emerged. CONCLUSION In this article, we review both functional and targeted imaging techniques for assessing tumor angiogenesis.  Conclusion Tumor angiogenesis is important for tumor growth and development. Current imaging techniques can be adapted to provide functional information regarding the status of the tumor vasculature. Future imaging will depend on the development of targeted imaging agents, probably PET- or SPECT-based, that will provide better specificity for angiogenic vessels and the early effects of molecular therapies. Therefore, the aim of imaging is shifting from functional to targeted molecular approaches. Although current experience with targeted molecular imaging is limited, further research in this field will eventually allow better characterization of tumor angiogenesis that will accelerate the development of targeted therapies for cancer.
