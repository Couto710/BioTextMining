Loci on 20q13 and 21q22 are associated with pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common inflammatory disorder with complex etiology that involves both genetic and environmental triggers, including but not limited to defects in bacterial clearance, defective mucosal barrier and persistent dysregulation of the immune response to commensal intestinal bacteria. IBD is characterized by two distinct phenotypes: Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Previously reported GWA studies have identified genetic variation accounting for a small portion of the overall genetic susceptibility to CD and an even smaller contribution to UC pathogenesis. We hypothesized that stratification of IBD by age of onset might identify additional genes associated with IBD. To that end, we carried out a GWA analysis in a cohort of 1,011 individuals with pediatric-onset IBD and 4,250 matched controls. We identified and replicated significantly associated, previously unreported loci on chromosomes 20q13 (rs2315008[T] and rs4809330[A]; P = 6.30 × 10?8 and 6.95 × 10?8, respectively; odds ratio (OR) = 0.74 for both) and 21q22 (rs2836878[A]; P = 6.01 × 10?8; OR = 0.73), located close to the TNFRSF6B and PSMG1 genes, respectively.  METHODS Study participants The IBD discovery cohort consisted of 1,011 individuals, including 647 with CD and 317 with UC ( Supplementary Table 3 online), with the remainder having indeterminate colitis. The IBD replication cohorts consisted of (i) 1,749 cases from the WTCCC and (ii) 173 cases that were recruited and genotyped at CHOP after genotyping analysis of the discovery set was completed. The mean age at diagnosis for the discovery cohort was 11.1 years (range 1–18 years). All individuals were diagnosed under the age of 19 years and fulfilled standard IBD diagnostic criteria 26 and phenotype characterization based on the Montreal classification 26 . Out of 1,011 subjects with IBD, 55% were males. Only subjects of European ancestry were used in the analysis; the program STRUCTURE 27 was used to determine greater than 95% European ancestry based on AIMS markers. Among individuals with CD, 17% had disease confined to ileum, 29% had disease confined to the colon and the remaining 54% had ileocolonic disease. Among individuals with UC subjects, 89% had pancolonic involvement, and only 11% had disease confined to left side of the colon. Mucosal intestinal biopsies were obtained for a subset of subjects during a routine diagnostic endoscopic procedure. The research ethics boards of the respective hospitals and other participating centers approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The control group used in the discovery phase included 4,250 children, 52.9% males and 47.1% females, with self-reported European descent and mean age 9.5 years who did not have IBD (neither CD nor UC). The replication control groups consisted of (i) 10,643 WTCCC subjects (that is, the WTCCC cohort except subjects with IBD, rheumatoid arthritis or type 1 diabetes) and (ii) an independent set of 3,481 children self-reported as of European descent. All controls were recruited by CHOP clinicians and nursing staff within the CHOP Health Care Network, including four primary care clinics and several group practices and outpatient practices that included well child visits. The Research Ethics Board of CHOP approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Self-reported European ancestry proved to be accurate, as the resulting genomic inflation factor for the IBD run was less than 1.1. Genotyping We carried out high-throughput genome-wide SNP genotyping using Illumina Infinium II HumanHap550 BeadChip technology at the Center for Applied Genomics at CHOP, as previously described 28 . For the discovery cohort, a total of 1,011 IBD cases (including 647 CD and 317 UC, with the remainder being indeterminate colitis) of European ancestry and 4,250 controls with matching ancestry were included in the final analyses. We rejected 7,215 SNPs with call rates <95%, 22,255 SNPs with MAF <1% and 3,381 SNPs with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P < 10?5. The threshold for significance was 1 × 10?7. The only cohort that showed substantial population stratification was the UC collection (genomic inflation factor = 1.3); the results for this subset were adjusted using EIGENSTRAT. For the replication study, an independent cohort of 173 IBD cases of European ancestry and 3,481 ancestry-matched controls were analyzed. We rejected a total of 10,381 SNPs were rejected with call rates <95%, 7,141 SNPs with MAF <1% and 53 SNPs with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P < 10?5. In addition, imputed allele frequencies for the WTCCC CD cohort were compared with those in all other WTCCC subjects (except those with autoimmune disease), including the 1958 UK birth cohort, yielding a total control set of 10,643 subjects. Combined P values were obtained using Fisher’s method. Gene expression analyses We examined gene expression in individual colonic biopsy specimens from subjects with pediatric-onset CD and UC and in healthy controls. Biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays, containing probes for approximately 22,634 genes, at the CCHMC Digestive Health Center Microarray Core. The images were captured using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000. We normalized data to allow for array-to-array comparisons, and we detected differences between groups in GeneSpring with significance at the 0.05 level relative to samples from healthy controls. Serum DCR3 concentration was determined by ELISA (R&D Systems) ( Supplementary Methods online).

The association signal resides in a region of LD that harbors several genes, including TNFRSF6B . Figure 2 Colonic TNFRSF6B expression and serum DCR3 concentration. ( a ) Colon biopsies were obtained from healthy controls ( n = 11, Crohn’s disease histological index of severity (CDHIS):0) and affected segments from individuals with Crohn’s disease with ileo-colonic ( n = 18, mean ± s.e.m. CDHIS: 4.1 ± 0.7) or colon-only ( n = 14, mean ± s.e.m CDHIS: 4.9 ± 1) location and individuals with UC ( n = 10, mean ± s.e.m. CDHIS: 7.2 ± 0.6, P < 0.05 vs. CD groups). We prepared RNA and determined the global pattern of gene expression using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome HG-U133 Plus 2.0 array. Data were normalized to an internal control reference sample, and then to the median value of the healthy control samples, to allow for comparison of mRNA expression in the IBD colon samples relative to the healthy control samples. Results for TNFRSF6B mRNA expression relative to controls are shown. ( b ) We determined the serum concentration of the TNFRSF6B gene product, DCR3, by ELISA in healthy controls ( n = 10), individuals with IBD with the TNFRSF6B GGGG genotype ( n = 17, carrying the major allelic variants: G at rs2315008 and G at rs4809330) and individuals with IBD with the TNFRSF6B TGAG genotype ( n = 11, carrying the minor allelic variants: T at rs2315008 and A at rs4809330). * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 vs. control, *** P < 0.05 vs. TNFRSF6B GGGG genotype.
