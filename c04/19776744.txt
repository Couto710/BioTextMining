The first 30 years of p53: growing ever more complex Thirty years ago, p53 was discovered as a cellular partner of SV40 Large Tumor Antigen, the oncoprotein of this tumor virus. The first decade of p53 research saw the cloning of p53 DNA and the realization that p53 is not an oncogene but a tumor suppressor that is very frequently mutated in human cancer. In the second decade, the function of p53, a transcription factor induced by stress, resulting in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence, was uncovered. In its third decade new functions were revealed, including regulation of metabolic pathways and cytokines required for embryo implantation. The fourth decade may see new p53-based drugs to treat cancer. What is next is anybodyâ€™s guess.
