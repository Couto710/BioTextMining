The roles of altitude and fear in the perception of height Previous research on perceiving spatial layout has found that people often exhibit normative biases in their perception of the environment. For instance, slant is typically overestimated and distance is usually underestimated. Surprisingly, however, the perception of height has rarely been studied. The present experiments examined the perception of height when viewed from the top (e.g., looking down), or from the bottom (e.g., looking up). Multiple measures were adapted from previous studies of horizontal extents to assess the perception of height. Across all of the measures, a large, consistent bias was found: vertical distances were greatly overestimated, especially from the top. Secondary findings suggest that the overestimation of distance and size that occurs when looking down from a high place correlates with reports of trait- and state-level fear of heights, suggesting that height overestimation may be due, in part, to fear.  Method Participants Forty-eight University of Virginia undergraduates (31 female, 17 male) participated in the experiment for $4 or for a course requirement. There were 13 females in the bottom viewing condition and 18 in the top viewing condition. There were 11 males in the bottom viewing condition and 6 in the top viewing condition. Due to an experimenter error, data for the AQ was not recorded for one participant in the top condition. Apparatus The balcony used in this experiment was 10.06 m high. The same orange disk used in Experiments 1a and 1b (45.72 cm in diameter) marked the distance and size to be judged. Tape measures were used to record the size and distance estimates. Measures In addition to the SUDS and AQ participants rated and then estimated the likelihood of being injured if they fell from the height (0 being no injury at all and 100 being death). We introduced this measure to deliberately make participants think about the danger and costs associated with the environment. Design Participants were randomly assigned to the top or bottom viewing condition. Each participant estimated the height of the balcony and then the size of the target disk. Procedure The only slight difference between this experiment and the previous experiments included the addition of the injury rating and a slight change in the way participants performed the matching task. However, the matching task in this experiment differed slightly from Experiment 1a. Because the balcony was not wide enough to conduct the matching task to the side of the participants, participants at the top and the bottom of the height were asked to turn around 180 degrees to move an experimenter to be the same distance from them as they were from the target. Also, participants were asked to complete the SUDS rating, then they gave their injury rating, and then they completed the AQ.

Method Participants Seventy-two University of Virginia undergraduates (36 female, 36 male) participated in the experiment for $5. There were 13 females in the horizontal viewing condition and bottom viewing conditions and 10 females in the top viewing condition. There were 11 males in the horizontal and bottom viewing conditions and 14 males in the top viewing condition. Apparatus The balcony used was the same as that described in Experiment 1a. Additional targets were added to test a range of sizes. The targets, all different colors, were made of core board. The pink target was 17.78 cm in diameter, the yellow target was 31.75 cm, the orange target (used in the previous experiments) was 45.72 cm, and the red target was 59.69 cm. For the horizontal viewing condition, the targets were displayed on a metal speaker stand that was 1.07 m tall. Magnets affixed to the back of the targets enabled them to be easily attached and removed from the top of the stand. The stand was placed 8 m from the participants’ feet along the horizontal ground plane. Design Participants were randomly assigned to the top, bottom, or horizontal viewing condition. Each participant estimated the size of each of the four target disks once. The order of presentation of the four targets was randomized. Each participant also made one estimate of the distance from oneself to the target disk viewed at that time. In the top viewing condition, participants estimated the distance from the top of the railing (approximately waist high) to the ground. In the horizontal and bottom viewing conditions, participants estimated the distance from their feet to the target. Procedure As in the previous experiments, the target was displayed for the participant and they adjusted a tape measure held by the experimenter to be the same length as the diameter of the target. The order of presentation of the targets was randomized and counterbalanced across conditions. Participants would turn (180 degrees) away while the targets were being switched by the other experimenter. After estimating the sizes of the four targets, participants were asked to estimate the distance to the final target by performing the visual matching task described in the previous experiments. Finally, all participants completed the SUDS and then the AQ. In addition, participants in the horizontal viewing condition were asked to report their general level of anxiety while standing on the horizontal ground plane for the SUDS.  Participants Seventy-two University of Virginia undergraduates (36 female, 36 male) participated in the experiment for $5.

Method Participants Twenty-eight University of Virginia undergraduates (19 female, 8 male) participated in the experiment for $5 or to satisfy a course requirement. There were 11 females in the bottom viewing condition and 8 in the top viewing condition. There were 3 males in the bottom viewing condition and 5 in the top viewing condition. Due to experimenter error, data for the SUDS and AQ were not recorded for two participants. Apparatus Participants viewed the orange target disk used in the previous experiments, from the same balcony as described in Experiment 1a. A blindfold was given to participants to perform the blindwalking task. A tape measure was used to measure the distance walked by the participant. Procedure Participants were randomly assigned to either the top or bottom viewing condition. The target was displaced 9 m to the left of the participants’ viewing positions when they were on the top and to the right of the participants’ viewing positions when they were on the bottom. The participant viewed the target from this alternate position and then walked without vision along a straight, oblique path until the participant believed he or she was directly above or below the target’s location (methodology adapted from Loomis et al., 1992 , see Figure 9 ). The distance that the observer walked served as his estimate of perceived distance to the target. In both conditions, the experimenter walked next to the participant while they blindwalked so as to limit veering from a straight path and to ensure safety. After participants completed the estimate, their walked distance was measured with the tape measure. All participants gave a SUDS rating after blindwalking to the target and completed the AQ after giving their blindwalked and SUDS estimates.  Participants Twenty-eight University of Virginia undergraduates (19 female, 8 male) participated in the experiment for $5 or to satisfy a course requirement.

Experiment 1a: Visually Matched Estimates of Height and Size from the Top and Bottom Method Participants Forty-eight University of Virginia undergraduate students (32 female, 16 male) participated in the experiment for a free snack. Sixteen females and 8 males were in both the top and bottom viewing conditions. Apparatus An 8 m balcony was used in the experiment. The balcony was 2.53 m wide and 38.86 m long. Participants stood 10.5 m from one end of the balcony to view the target. A large orange disk made of core board (45.72 cm or 18 in diameter) marked the distance to be judged. Tape measures were used to record the participants’ size and distance estimates. Participants completed the Acrophobia Questionnaire - Anxiety Subscale (AQ, Cohen, 1977 ) to measure general fear associated with heights. This scale measures the degree to which a person has fear-relevant thoughts during exposure to different types of heights. People who have acrophobia typically score a 60 or above. Possible scores range from 0 to 120. In addition, participants reported their state fear levels during exposure to the heights in these experiments. State fear was assessed using verbal reports on a 0 to 100 scale, the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS), with 100 reflecting extreme fear. These fear ratings served as a measure of fear associated with the specific height used in the experiments. Design Participants were randomly assigned to either the top or bottom viewing condition (see Figure 1 ). Each participant made one estimate of the distance from themselves to the target disk and one estimate of the size of the target. Procedure Participants who viewed the height from the top stood on the edge of a two-story balcony (there was a railing in front of the participant) with the target disk placed on the ground beneath the balcony. After viewing the target, they estimated the height of the balcony by trying to position an experimenter to be the same distance from them along the balcony as the participant was to the target on the ground. More specifically, participants were told to judge from the railing to the ground. Participants were encouraged to look back and forth at the target and the experimenter as often as they liked. Participants who stood on the ground viewed the balcony with the target suspended from the railing. They also estimated the height of the balcony by positioning an experimenter to be the same distance as they were from the target. They were specifically told to match the distance from their feet to the top of the railing. All participants gave visual-matching size estimates of the target disk by adjusting a tape measure in the frontal plane to match the diameter of the target as if it were on the ground plane in front of them. The metric markings on the tape measure faced away from the participants. The participants were allowed to look back and forth between the experimenter and the target as much as they liked. After the two estimation tasks, participants completed the SUDS and AQ (in that order) and received a snack. Results Height Participants in the top viewing condition overestimated the height of the balcony by 60% with the visual matching task, whereas participants in the bottom condition overestimated the height by 30% (see Figure 2a ). A one-way ANOVA showed that height estimates made from the top ( M = 12.57, SD = 3.12) were significantly larger than those made from the bottom ( M = 9.71, SD = 1.79), F (1, 47) = 15.10, p < 0.0001, ? p 2 = 0.23. Participants who viewed the height from the top overestimated by 60%, whereas participants who viewed the height from the bottom overestimated by only 29%. The magnitude of overestimation difference between the top and bottom condition was 31%. Size Participants also overestimated the size of the target disk when viewing from the top, but not when viewing from the bottom (see Figure 2b ). A one-way ANOVA showed that the size overestimation from the top ( M = 57.00, SD = 10.90) was significantly different from the estimates made from the bottom ( M = 46.89, SD = 8.39), F (1,47) = 12.97, p = 0.001, ? p 2 = 0.20. Participants who viewed the target from the top overestimated its size by 24.6 %, whereas participants who viewed the target from the bottom overestimated its size by only 2.5%. The magnitude of overestimation difference between the top and bottom condition was 22%. Fear On average, participants who viewed the height from the bottom reported low feelings of state-level fear on the SUDS ( M = 9.42, SD = 11.86) and fairly low trait-level fear on the AQ ( M = 27.17, SD = 14.42). This is not surprising given they were on the ground and were non-acrophobes. The participants in the top viewing condition reported higher state-level fear ( M = 19.00, SD = 16.76) than the bottom participants, F (1,47) = 5.23, p = 0.03, ? p 2 = 0.10. The top participants’ trait-level reports of fear on the AQ ( M = 30.25, SD = 14.16) were not different from the bottom condition and were also well below the acrophobe range. Overall, participants’ state and trait-level reports of fear were positively correlated, regardless of the viewing condition, r (47) = 0.50, p <0.0001. To test whether fear moderated the overestimation of height, the height and size estimates were correlated with participants’ ratings of state-level fear on the SUDS and their trait-level fear score on the AQ. There was a positive correlation between SUDS ratings and the height estimates, r (47) = 0.42, p = 0.003, and a similar trend for the size estimates, r (47) = 0.27, p = 0.06 (see Figure 3a and 3b , respectively). Participants who were more anxious about the balcony (higher scores on the SUDS) estimated the height to be taller and the size of the target to be larger. In addition, there was a positive correlation between participants’ scores on the AQ and their height estimates, r (47) = 0.33, p = 0.02 (see Figure 4 ). In contrast, there was no relationship between scores on the AQ and size estimates, r (47) = 0.14, p = 0.33. Participants who had scored higher on the AQ perceived the height of the balcony as taller but the target did not appear bigger. Discussion When participants stood on the top of a balcony, they estimated its height to be 31% taller than participants who stood at the bottom. Accordingly, participants who viewed from the top also overestimated the size of a target on the ground to be 22% larger than participants who viewed the same target from the ground. The results of the size estimation task suggest that other measures of spatial layout elicit similar overestimations when compared to distance estimation tasks. Furthermore, both results suggest that a gross overestimation of height and size are observed when participants view from the top compared to the bottom. The overestimation of size from the top is an important finding because it controls for a potential confound in this experiment. Specifically, participants in the top viewing condition may have estimated the height of the balcony to be taller because the distance actually is greater if they are judging from their eye height to the target. However, the estimates of the size of the target should have been accurate in both the top and bottom viewing conditions if the distance estimates were accurate (which one would expect if participants judged from their eye height). The overestimation of the size of the target from the top provides further evidence for an overestimation of apparent distance. Thus, in addition to providing an important converging measure of distance perception, the size-matching task controlled for the possible influence of eye height on apparent distance between the top and bottom viewing conditions. The overestimation of height with the visual matching task was also correlated with participants’ state- and trait-level fear of heights. Even though participants were non-acrophobes, their estimates of the height correlated with their fear of heights in both viewing conditions. This finding was surprising because we had thought that the fear measures would be more likely to correlate with the estimates from the top. One possible explanation for this finding is that people who are afraid of heights are simply influenced by the appearance of a height, regardless of where they stand to view it. The sight of the height may be enough to trigger their state- or trait-level fears associated with heights and influence their estimates from the top or the ground. However, it should be noted that the trait-level ratings of fear only correlated with the height estimates, but not the size estimates. This finding suggests that people with a trait-level fear of heights may only overestimate the parameter that is related to their fear. In other words, it may not be that everything in the environment becomes larger when someone high in height fear views a height, but rather that only the elicitor of their fear, the height itself, is distorted. One potential problem with this experiment is that the overestimation of height from the top may be due to looking down in general. The act of looking down may have resulted in the large overestimation from the top. Experiment 1b was performed to assess whether looking down resulted in an overestimation of a lower height. The experiment was also performed to estimate the range of extents for which this overestimation occurs from the top. Lower heights may not be overestimated because they do not evoke fear and optical cues that specify distance are more apparent at these locations.

This scale measures the degree to which a person has fear-relevant thoughts during exposure to different types of heights. People who have acrophobia typically score a 60 or above. Possible scores range from 0 to 120. In addition, participants reported their state fear levels during exposure to the heights in these experiments. State fear was assessed using verbal reports on a 0 to 100 scale, the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS), with 100 reflecting extreme fear. These fear ratings served as a measure of fear associated with the specific height used in the experiments. Design Participants were randomly assigned to either the top or bottom viewing condition (see Figure 1 ). Each participant made one estimate of the distance from themselves to the target disk and one estimate of the size of the target. Procedure Participants who viewed the height from the top stood on the edge of a two-story balcony (there was a railing in front of the participant) with the target disk placed on the ground beneath the balcony. After viewing the target, they estimated the height of the balcony by trying to position an experimenter to be the same distance from them along the balcony as the participant was to the target on the ground. More specifically, participants were told to judge from the railing to the ground. Participants were encouraged to look back and forth at the target and the experimenter as often as they liked. Participants who stood on the ground viewed the balcony with the target suspended from the railing. They also estimated the height of the balcony by positioning an experimenter to be the same distance as they were from the target. They were specifically told to match the distance from their feet to the top of the railing. All participants gave visual-matching size estimates of the target disk by adjusting a tape measure in the frontal plane to match the diameter of the target as if it were on the ground plane in front of them. The metric markings on the tape measure faced away from the participants. The participants were allowed to look back and forth between the experimenter and the target as much as they liked. After the two estimation tasks, participants completed the SUDS and AQ (in that order) and received a snack.

Results Height Participants in the top viewing condition overestimated the height of the balcony by 60% with the visual matching task, whereas participants in the bottom condition overestimated the height by 30% (see Figure 2a ). A one-way ANOVA showed that height estimates made from the top ( M = 12.57, SD = 3.12) were significantly larger than those made from the bottom ( M = 9.71, SD = 1.79), F (1, 47) = 15.10, p < 0.0001, ? p 2 = 0.23. Participants who viewed the height from the top overestimated by 60%, whereas participants who viewed the height from the bottom overestimated by only 29%. The magnitude of overestimation difference between the top and bottom condition was 31%. Size Participants also overestimated the size of the target disk when viewing from the top, but not when viewing from the bottom (see Figure 2b ). A one-way ANOVA showed that the size overestimation from the top ( M = 57.00, SD = 10.90) was significantly different from the estimates made from the bottom ( M = 46.89, SD = 8.39), F (1,47) = 12.97, p = 0.001, ? p 2 = 0.20. Participants who viewed the target from the top overestimated its size by 24.6 %, whereas participants who viewed the target from the bottom overestimated its size by only 2.5%. The magnitude of overestimation difference between the top and bottom condition was 22%. Fear On average, participants who viewed the height from the bottom reported low feelings of state-level fear on the SUDS ( M = 9.42, SD = 11.86) and fairly low trait-level fear on the AQ ( M = 27.17, SD = 14.42). This is not surprising given they were on the ground and were non-acrophobes. The participants in the top viewing condition reported higher state-level fear ( M = 19.00, SD = 16.76) than the bottom participants, F (1,47) = 5.23, p = 0.03, ? p 2 = 0.10. The top participants’ trait-level reports of fear on the AQ ( M = 30.25, SD = 14.16) were not different from the bottom condition and were also well below the acrophobe range. Overall, participants’ state and trait-level reports of fear were positively correlated, regardless of the viewing condition, r (47) = 0.50, p <0.0001. To test whether fear moderated the overestimation of height, the height and size estimates were correlated with participants’ ratings of state-level fear on the SUDS and their trait-level fear score on the AQ. There was a positive correlation between SUDS ratings and the height estimates, r (47) = 0.42, p = 0.003, and a similar trend for the size estimates, r (47) = 0.27, p = 0.06 (see Figure 3a and 3b , respectively). Participants who were more anxious about the balcony (higher scores on the SUDS) estimated the height to be taller and the size of the target to be larger. In addition, there was a positive correlation between participants’ scores on the AQ and their height estimates, r (47) = 0.33, p = 0.02 (see Figure 4 ). In contrast, there was no relationship between scores on the AQ and size estimates, r (47) = 0.14, p = 0.33. Participants who had scored higher on the AQ perceived the height of the balcony as taller but the target did not appear bigger.

Participants who had scored higher on the AQ perceived the height of the balcony as taller but the target did not appear bigger.  Discussion When participants stood on the top of a balcony, they estimated its height to be 31% taller than participants who stood at the bottom. Accordingly, participants who viewed from the top also overestimated the size of a target on the ground to be 22% larger than participants who viewed the same target from the ground. The results of the size estimation task suggest that other measures of spatial layout elicit similar overestimations when compared to distance estimation tasks. Furthermore, both results suggest that a gross overestimation of height and size are observed when participants view from the top compared to the bottom. The overestimation of size from the top is an important finding because it controls for a potential confound in this experiment. Specifically, participants in the top viewing condition may have estimated the height of the balcony to be taller because the distance actually is greater if they are judging from their eye height to the target. However, the estimates of the size of the target should have been accurate in both the top and bottom viewing conditions if the distance estimates were accurate (which one would expect if participants judged from their eye height). The overestimation of the size of the target from the top provides further evidence for an overestimation of apparent distance. Thus, in addition to providing an important converging measure of distance perception, the size-matching task controlled for the possible influence of eye height on apparent distance between the top and bottom viewing conditions. The overestimation of height with the visual matching task was also correlated with participants’ state- and trait-level fear of heights. Even though participants were non-acrophobes, their estimates of the height correlated with their fear of heights in both viewing conditions. This finding was surprising because we had thought that the fear measures would be more likely to correlate with the estimates from the top. One possible explanation for this finding is that people who are afraid of heights are simply influenced by the appearance of a height, regardless of where they stand to view it. The sight of the height may be enough to trigger their state- or trait-level fears associated with heights and influence their estimates from the top or the ground. However, it should be noted that the trait-level ratings of fear only correlated with the height estimates, but not the size estimates. This finding suggests that people with a trait-level fear of heights may only overestimate the parameter that is related to their fear. In other words, it may not be that everything in the environment becomes larger when someone high in height fear views a height, but rather that only the elicitor of their fear, the height itself, is distorted. One potential problem with this experiment is that the overestimation of height from the top may be due to looking down in general. The act of looking down may have resulted in the large overestimation from the top. Experiment 1b was performed to assess whether looking down resulted in an overestimation of a lower height. The experiment was also performed to estimate the range of extents for which this overestimation occurs from the top. Lower heights may not be overestimated because they do not evoke fear and optical cues that specify distance are more apparent at these locations.  Discussion When participants stood on the top of a balcony, they estimated its height to be 31% taller than participants who stood at the bottom.

Experiment 1b: Visually Matched Estimates of a Lower Height from the Top Method Participants Twenty-four University of Virginia undergraduates (18 female, 6 male) participated in the experiment for a free snack. Apparatus A lower balcony (1.60m) was used in this experiment. A large orange disk made of core board (45.72 cm in diameter) marked the distance to be judged. Tape measures were used to record the size and distance estimates. Procedure In this experiment, all participants viewed the height from the top of the balcony. The bottom viewing condition was not run because the target was either at or below eye level for most of the participants. All participants stood on the balcony and estimated the distance to the target and the size of the target as in Experiment 1a. All participants completed the SUDS and AQ after the perceptual estimates. Results Height A one-sample t-test was performed to determine whether the height estimates from the top of the small height were different from the actual height of the balcony. Visually matched estimates of the height were significantly greater than the actual height of the balcony, t (1, 23) = 2.75, p = 0.01, d = 0.83. On average, participants estimated the height of the balcony to be 1.84 m ( SD = 0.39) tall. This represented a 14% overestimation of the actual height of the balcony. Participants overestimated the height of a lower balcony, but not to the extent of the overestimation observed in Experiment 1a. Size A one-sample t-test showed that size estimates of the target were not significantly different from the actual size of the target, t (1, 23) = -1.60, p = 0.12. On average, participants estimated the size of the target to be 43.97 cm ( SD = 5.33) wide. This represented a 4% underestimation of the actual size of the target. Size estimates were positively correlated with height estimates, r (23) = 0.48, p = 0.02. Even though participants showed an overestimation of height with the distance measure, they did not overestimate the size of the target. Fear To test whether fear moderated the overestimation of height, we correlated the height and size estimates with participants’ SUDS ratings and their scores on the AQ. Overall, SUDS ratings were low ( M = 5.29, SD = 4.68) and AQ scores were a little higher than in the previous experiment ( M = 32.83, SD = 18.07). Participants’ scores on the SUDS and AQ were highly correlated, r (23) = 0.58, p = 0.003. There was a negative correlation between participants’ scores on the AQ and their size estimates, r (23) = -0.44, p = 0.03. Participants who had higher trait-level fear estimated the size of the target to be smaller, so it does not seem as if fear moderated the perception of height in this experiment. There was no relationship between SUDS ratings and size estimates, p = 0.30 or height estimates, p = 0.83. There was also no relation between participants’ height estimates and their scores on the AQ, p = 0.41. Discussion This experiment suggests that participants do not overestimate a small height from above as much as the larger height used in Experiment 1a. Therefore, looking down in general seems to produce about half of the overestimation of height (14%) than that observed in Experiment 1a (60%). Also, there was no overestimation of size, suggesting that the participants in this experiment may have used their eye height to scale distance to the object (rather than judging from the railing as they were told), which did not result in an overestimation of size. The overestimation of height did not correlate with state- or trait-level fear. This is not surprising, given that the height was not tall and probably did not evoke physiological fear responses. Also, participants with higher trait-level fear estimated the size of the targets to be smaller, suggesting an opposite trend from the previous experiment.

Size A one-sample t-test showed that size estimates of the target were not significantly different from the actual size of the target, t (1, 23) = -1.60, p = 0.12. On average, participants estimated the size of the target to be 43.97 cm ( SD = 5.33) wide. This represented a 4% underestimation of the actual size of the target. Size estimates were positively correlated with height estimates, r (23) = 0.48, p = 0.02. Even though participants showed an overestimation of height with the distance measure, they did not overestimate the size of the target. Fear To test whether fear moderated the overestimation of height, we correlated the height and size estimates with participants’ SUDS ratings and their scores on the AQ. Overall, SUDS ratings were low ( M = 5.29, SD = 4.68) and AQ scores were a little higher than in the previous experiment ( M = 32.83, SD = 18.07). Participants’ scores on the SUDS and AQ were highly correlated, r (23) = 0.58, p = 0.003. There was a negative correlation between participants’ scores on the AQ and their size estimates, r (23) = -0.44, p = 0.03. Participants who had higher trait-level fear estimated the size of the target to be smaller, so it does not seem as if fear moderated the perception of height in this experiment. There was no relationship between SUDS ratings and size estimates, p = 0.30 or height estimates, p = 0.83. There was also no relation between participants’ height estimates and their scores on the AQ, p = 0.41. Discussion This experiment suggests that participants do not overestimate a small height from above as much as the larger height used in Experiment 1a. Therefore, looking down in general seems to produce about half of the overestimation of height (14%) than that observed in Experiment 1a (60%). Also, there was no overestimation of size, suggesting that the participants in this experiment may have used their eye height to scale distance to the object (rather than judging from the railing as they were told), which did not result in an overestimation of size. The overestimation of height did not correlate with state- or trait-level fear. This is not surprising, given that the height was not tall and probably did not evoke physiological fear responses. Also, participants with higher trait-level fear estimated the size of the targets to be smaller, suggesting an opposite trend from the previous experiment.  Method Participants Twenty-four University of Virginia undergraduates (18 female, 6 male) participated in the experiment for a free snack. Apparatus A lower balcony (1.60m) was used in this experiment. A large orange disk made of core board (45.72 cm in diameter) marked the distance to be judged. Tape measures were used to record the size and distance estimates. Procedure In this experiment, all participants viewed the height from the top of the balcony. The bottom viewing condition was not run because the target was either at or below eye level for most of the participants. All participants stood on the balcony and estimated the distance to the target and the size of the target as in Experiment 1a. All participants completed the SUDS and AQ after the perceptual estimates.

Results Height A one-sample t-test was performed to determine whether the height estimates from the top of the small height were different from the actual height of the balcony.

Experiment 1c: Visually Matched Estimates of Height and Size from the Top and Bottom of a Different Height This experiment is similar to Experiment 1a, except that a different location was used. This experiment examined whether the effect seen in the previous experiment (1a) was specific to optical cues available at the location of that balcony. In addition, the use of a slightly taller balcony in this experiment could increase participants’ fear associated with the height. Method Participants Forty-eight University of Virginia undergraduates (31 female, 17 male) participated in the experiment for $4 or for a course requirement. There were 13 females in the bottom viewing condition and 18 in the top viewing condition. There were 11 males in the bottom viewing condition and 6 in the top viewing condition. Due to an experimenter error, data for the AQ was not recorded for one participant in the top condition. Apparatus The balcony used in this experiment was 10.06 m high. The same orange disk used in Experiments 1a and 1b (45.72 cm in diameter) marked the distance and size to be judged. Tape measures were used to record the size and distance estimates. Measures In addition to the SUDS and AQ participants rated and then estimated the likelihood of being injured if they fell from the height (0 being no injury at all and 100 being death). We introduced this measure to deliberately make participants think about the danger and costs associated with the environment. Design Participants were randomly assigned to the top or bottom viewing condition. Each participant estimated the height of the balcony and then the size of the target disk. Procedure The only slight difference between this experiment and the previous experiments included the addition of the injury rating and a slight change in the way participants performed the matching task. However, the matching task in this experiment differed slightly from Experiment 1a. Because the balcony was not wide enough to conduct the matching task to the side of the participants, participants at the top and the bottom of the height were asked to turn around 180 degrees to move an experimenter to be the same distance from them as they were from the target. Also, participants were asked to complete the SUDS rating, then they gave their injury rating, and then they completed the AQ. Results Height As in Experiment 1a, participants in the top viewing condition overestimated the height of the balcony with the visual matching task, whereas participants in the bottom condition overestimated height less (see Figure 5a ). A one-way ANOVA showed that height estimates made from the top ( M = 17.60, SD = 4.72) were significantly larger than those made from the bottom ( M = 12.68, SD = 3.07), F (1, 47) = 18.33, p < 0.0001, ? p 2 = 0.29. Participants who viewed the height from the top overestimated by 74%, whereas participants who viewed the height from the bottom overestimated by 26%. The magnitude of overestimation difference between the top and bottom condition was 48%. Size As in Experiment 1a , participants overestimated the size of the target disk when viewing from the top, but not when viewing from the bottom (see Figure 5b ). A one-way ANOVA showed that the size overestimation from the top ( M = 56.91, SD = 13.43) was significantly different from the estimates made from the bottom ( M = 48.16, SD = 10.93), F (1,47) = 6.14, p = 0.02, ? p 2 = 0.12. Participants who viewed the target from the top overestimated its size by 24%, whereas participants who viewed the target from the bottom overestimated its size by only 5%. The size estimates were positively correlated with the height estimates, r (46) = 0.56, p < 0.0001. Fear On average, participants who viewed the height from the bottom reported low feelings of state-level fear on the SUDS question ( M = 12.21, SD = 13.10) and low trait-level scores on the AQ ( M = 29.75, SD = 14.93). Again, the state-level ratings are not surprising given that these participants were standing on the ground. The bottom participants’ ratings of injury due to falling from the height were in the middle of the range of possible scores ( M = 57.21, SD = 25.01). The participants in the top viewing condition reported significantly higher state-level fear ( M = 26.06, SD = 24.10) than the bottom participants, F (1, 47) = 6.12, p = 0.02, ? p 2 = 0.12. The trait-level reports of fear for participants viewing from the top on the AQ ( M = 35.78, SD = 19.73) were not significantly higher than the participants viewing from the bottom, p = 0.24, and were also well below the acrophobe range. The top participants’ ratings of injury due to falling from the height were fairly high ( M = 68.13, SD = 21.61), but were not significantly higher than the bottom participants’ ratings, p = 0.11. Interestingly, participants’ state and trait-level reports of fear were not correlated, regardless of the viewing condition, p = 0.13, though there was a trend in this direction. Also, AQ scores were not correlated with injury scores, p = 0.52. However, injury ratings and SUDS scores were correlated for participants viewing from the top, r (22) = 0.44, p = 0.03, and the overall correlation, regardless of condition approached significance, r (46) = 0.26, p = 0.07. To test whether fear was a factor that moderated the overestimation of height, we correlated the height and size estimates with participants’ ratings of state-level fear on the SUDS question, their ratings of potential injury, and their trait-level fear score on the AQ. There was a positive correlation between SUDS ratings and the size estimates, r (46) = 0.28, p = 0.05, but no relation between SUDS scores and height estimates, p = 0.44. Participants who were more anxious about the balcony estimated the size of the target to be larger. Trait-level fear, as measured with the AQ, did not relate to the height or size estimates, p = 0.84 and 0.62, respectively. Predicted injury sustained from falling also did not correlate with the height or size estimates, p = 0.12 and 0.72, respectively. Interestingly, injury ratings, SUDS ratings, and scores on the AQ did not correlate with each other. Discussion This experiment replicated the overestimation of height and size observed in Experiment 1a. It shows, therefore, that the results from previous experiments were not due to the particular balconies used in those experiments. However, the overestimation of height was not related to participants’ state- or trait-level ratings of fear. Participants’ size estimates were positively correlated with their state-level fear ratings, but this correlation was small. Therefore, the conclusions about fear (state- or trait-level) influencing perception are tentative at best. Participants had to turn farther away from the height to perform the matching task in this experiment, which may have reduced their state-level fear associated with the height. Also, participants were randomly selected from the participant pool and the group of participants in this experiment may have not been as afraid of heights (trait-level) as the group in Experiment 1a. Other differences in the heights could also have resulted in reduced fear reactions. For example, the balcony used in Experiment 1a had a steel railing, whereas the balcony used in this experiment had a solid brick wall at waist height to prevent participants from falling. The brick wall may have made them feel safer. Also, it is important to note that fear of falling (as assessed by the injury or SUDS rating) may not be the only relevant variable of interest when assessing fear of heights, which could account for an inconsistency in the findings with the fear measures that were used across these studies. In fact, most people with fear of heights express multiple fears related to being in a high place, and some seem not to have a fear of falling at all ( Menzies & Clark, 1995 ). Instead, many report a fear of losing control or panicking while on the height that would put them in danger (i.e., ’fear of fear’). Thus, likelihood of injury is not the only relevant variable for describing the relationship between actual and estimated distance and size, and measuring the fear reactions in a more individualized way is outside of the scope of this paper.

Results Height As in Experiment 1a, participants in the top viewing condition overestimated the height of the balcony with the visual matching task, whereas participants in the bottom condition overestimated height less (see Figure 5a ). A one-way ANOVA showed that height estimates made from the top ( M = 17.60, SD = 4.72) were significantly larger than those made from the bottom ( M = 12.68, SD = 3.07), F (1, 47) = 18.33, p < 0.0001, ? p 2 = 0.29. Participants who viewed the height from the top overestimated by 74%, whereas participants who viewed the height from the bottom overestimated by 26%. The magnitude of overestimation difference between the top and bottom condition was 48%. Size As in Experiment 1a , participants overestimated the size of the target disk when viewing from the top, but not when viewing from the bottom (see Figure 5b ). A one-way ANOVA showed that the size overestimation from the top ( M = 56.91, SD = 13.43) was significantly different from the estimates made from the bottom ( M = 48.16, SD = 10.93), F (1,47) = 6.14, p = 0.02, ? p 2 = 0.12. Participants who viewed the target from the top overestimated its size by 24%, whereas participants who viewed the target from the bottom overestimated its size by only 5%. The size estimates were positively correlated with the height estimates, r (46) = 0.56, p < 0.0001. Fear On average, participants who viewed the height from the bottom reported low feelings of state-level fear on the SUDS question ( M = 12.21, SD = 13.10) and low trait-level scores on the AQ ( M = 29.75, SD = 14.93). Again, the state-level ratings are not surprising given that these participants were standing on the ground. The bottom participants’ ratings of injury due to falling from the height were in the middle of the range of possible scores ( M = 57.21, SD = 25.01). The participants in the top viewing condition reported significantly higher state-level fear ( M = 26.06, SD = 24.10) than the bottom participants, F (1, 47) = 6.12, p = 0.02, ? p 2 = 0.12. The trait-level reports of fear for participants viewing from the top on the AQ ( M = 35.78, SD = 19.73) were not significantly higher than the participants viewing from the bottom, p = 0.24, and were also well below the acrophobe range. The top participants’ ratings of injury due to falling from the height were fairly high ( M = 68.13, SD = 21.61), but were not significantly higher than the bottom participants’ ratings, p = 0.11. Interestingly, participants’ state and trait-level reports of fear were not correlated, regardless of the viewing condition, p = 0.13, though there was a trend in this direction. Also, AQ scores were not correlated with injury scores, p = 0.52. However, injury ratings and SUDS scores were correlated for participants viewing from the top, r (22) = 0.44, p = 0.03, and the overall correlation, regardless of condition approached significance, r (46) = 0.26, p = 0.07. To test whether fear was a factor that moderated the overestimation of height, we correlated the height and size estimates with participants’ ratings of state-level fear on the SUDS question, their ratings of potential injury, and their trait-level fear score on the AQ. There was a positive correlation between SUDS ratings and the size estimates, r (46) = 0.28, p = 0.05, but no relation between SUDS scores and height estimates, p = 0.44. Participants who were more anxious about the balcony estimated the size of the target to be larger. Trait-level fear, as measured with the AQ, did not relate to the height or size estimates, p = 0.84 and 0.62, respectively. Predicted injury sustained from falling also did not correlate with the height or size estimates, p = 0.12 and 0.72, respectively. Interestingly, injury ratings, SUDS ratings, and scores on the AQ did not correlate with each other.

Discussion This experiment replicated the overestimation of height and size observed in Experiment 1a. It shows, therefore, that the results from previous experiments were not due to the particular balconies used in those experiments. However, the overestimation of height was not related to participants’ state- or trait-level ratings of fear. Participants’ size estimates were positively correlated with their state-level fear ratings, but this correlation was small. Therefore, the conclusions about fear (state- or trait-level) influencing perception are tentative at best. Participants had to turn farther away from the height to perform the matching task in this experiment, which may have reduced their state-level fear associated with the height. Also, participants were randomly selected from the participant pool and the group of participants in this experiment may have not been as afraid of heights (trait-level) as the group in Experiment 1a. Other differences in the heights could also have resulted in reduced fear reactions. For example, the balcony used in Experiment 1a had a steel railing, whereas the balcony used in this experiment had a solid brick wall at waist height to prevent participants from falling. The brick wall may have made them feel safer. Also, it is important to note that fear of falling (as assessed by the injury or SUDS rating) may not be the only relevant variable of interest when assessing fear of heights, which could account for an inconsistency in the findings with the fear measures that were used across these studies. In fact, most people with fear of heights express multiple fears related to being in a high place, and some seem not to have a fear of falling at all ( Menzies & Clark, 1995 ). Instead, many report a fear of losing control or panicking while on the height that would put them in danger (i.e., ’fear of fear’). Thus, likelihood of injury is not the only relevant variable for describing the relationship between actual and estimated distance and size, and measuring the fear reactions in a more individualized way is outside of the scope of this paper.

Experiment 2: Multiple Size Estimates from Top, Bottom and Horizontal Viewing Angles Experiment 2 tested whether participants overestimated height by examining a range of target sizes. In addition, a horizontal viewing condition was introduced to serve as a baseline for participants’ estimates of distance and size. This baseline was employed to confirm that there was nothing about the particular target used in the previous experiments that resulted in abnormal size or distance estimates. Also, repeated estimation of size allowed for a test of whether fear influences the slope of the function of size estimates or the intercept of the function. Method Participants Seventy-two University of Virginia undergraduates (36 female, 36 male) participated in the experiment for $5. There were 13 females in the horizontal viewing condition and bottom viewing conditions and 10 females in the top viewing condition. There were 11 males in the horizontal and bottom viewing conditions and 14 males in the top viewing condition. Apparatus The balcony used was the same as that described in Experiment 1a. Additional targets were added to test a range of sizes. The targets, all different colors, were made of core board. The pink target was 17.78 cm in diameter, the yellow target was 31.75 cm, the orange target (used in the previous experiments) was 45.72 cm, and the red target was 59.69 cm. For the horizontal viewing condition, the targets were displayed on a metal speaker stand that was 1.07 m tall. Magnets affixed to the back of the targets enabled them to be easily attached and removed from the top of the stand. The stand was placed 8 m from the participants’ feet along the horizontal ground plane. Design Participants were randomly assigned to the top, bottom, or horizontal viewing condition. Each participant estimated the size of each of the four target disks once. The order of presentation of the four targets was randomized. Each participant also made one estimate of the distance from oneself to the target disk viewed at that time. In the top viewing condition, participants estimated the distance from the top of the railing (approximately waist high) to the ground. In the horizontal and bottom viewing conditions, participants estimated the distance from their feet to the target. Procedure As in the previous experiments, the target was displayed for the participant and they adjusted a tape measure held by the experimenter to be the same length as the diameter of the target. The order of presentation of the targets was randomized and counterbalanced across conditions. Participants would turn (180 degrees) away while the targets were being switched by the other experimenter. After estimating the sizes of the four targets, participants were asked to estimate the distance to the final target by performing the visual matching task described in the previous experiments. Finally, all participants completed the SUDS and then the AQ. In addition, participants in the horizontal viewing condition were asked to report their general level of anxiety while standing on the horizontal ground plane for the SUDS. Results Size A 4 (target size) × 3 (condition) repeated measures ANOVA was performed with target size as a within-subjects variable and condition as a between-subjects variable. As expected, the analysis indicated a within-subjects effect of size, F (3,207) = 706.47, p < 0.0001, ? p 2 = 0.91 and a between-subjects effect of condition, F (1,69) = 10.68, p < 0.0001, ? p 2 = 0.24. Post-hoc analyses using Tukey’s HSD showed that participants in the top viewing condition estimated the size of the targets to be significantly greater than participants in the bottom and horizontal viewing conditions, p <0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively. This difference was significant for each target size (see Table 1 ). The horizontal and bottom conditions’ size estimates were not significantly different from one another, p = 0.51. There was no size × condition interaction, p = .07, though it trended toward significance. Height A one-way ANOVA comparing the visually matched estimates of distance for each condition revealed that there was an effect of condition on estimates of distance, F (1,69) = 55.80, p < 0.0001, ? p 2 = 0.61 (see Figure 6 ). Post-hoc analyses using Tukey’s HSD showed that the top ( M = 11.95, SD = 1.99), bottom ( M = 10.14, SD = 1.88), and horizontal ( M = 6.86, SD = 1.03) viewing conditions were all significantly different from each other, p = 0.001 for the bottom and top comparison , p < 0.0001 for the bottom and horizontal comparison, and p < 0.0001 for the top and horizontal comparison. The top viewing condition showed a 52% overestimation, the bottom condition showed a 29% overestimation and the horizontal condition underestimated the distance by 13%. There was no correlation between the last target size viewed and the distance estimate, p = 0.41, so it does not seem as if the finally viewed target size was related to participants’ estimates of the distance to the target. Fear Average error in size estimation was computed by subtracting actual size of the target from participants’ size estimates for that target. Underestimations of size were set to zero, though there were only a few underestimations and they were all in the horizontal viewing condition. Deviations from the actual size for each target size were added together and the resulting number was divided by four (the total number of targets). To test whether fear moderated the overestimation of height, average error in size estimates was correlated with participants’ SUDS ratings and their scores on the AQ. Participants’ scores on the two fear scales were correlated, r (71) = 0.36, p = 0.002. There was a positive correlation between participants’ SUDS ratings and the average error of their size estimates, r (71) = 0.30, p = 0.01 (see Figure 7 ). Participants who had higher state-level fear perceived larger targets. There was no relation between scores for the AQ and size estimates, p = 0.76 or distance estimates, p = 0.46. There was also no relation between participants’ height estimates and their SUDS ratings, p = 0.55. Linear mixed models (LMM) were used to calculate the intercepts and slopes for the ratios of perceived to actual size over the different targets sizes. This statistical method was chosen because it computes model parameter estimates (intercept and slope) while taking into account the repeated measures nature of the data. Separate LMM were computed for the low and high fear SUDS conditions. Intercept and participant were specified as random factors and target size was specified as a fixed factor. In addition, LMM allows for the specification of the appropriate variance structure (see Moser, 2004 ; Singer, 1998 ). An unstructured variance matrix provided the best fit for both models, indicating the residuals were not highly correlated in either SUDS condition. The slope of the low fear SUDS condition ( B 1 = -.022, SE = .002, t (32) = 9.73, p < .001) was significantly different from zero, as was the slope of the high fear condition ( B 1 = -.002, SE = .003, t (38) = 5.60, p < .001). Most importantly, the slope of the low fear condition was reliably steeper than that for the high fear condition, t (70) = 17.81, p <.001, d = 0.30, R 2 = .08 (see Figure 8 ). Both the intercept for the low fear condition ( B 0 = 1.623, SE = .048, t (32) = 33.93, p < .001) and high fear condition ( B 0 = 1.623, SE = .087, t (38) = 18.61, p < .001) were greater than zero. However, no reliable difference was found between intercepts, t (70) = .04, p =.97, d = .02, R 2 < .01. The slope results indicate fear differentially affects the function of size perception, with the gap in perceived size between the high and low fear groups increasing as targets become larger. Although the data in both conditions do not appear particularly linear, non-linear models were overspecified. This overspecification is probably due to having only 4 size estimates per participant. With an increased number and range of size estimates, it is certainly plausible that power functions with negative exponents could provide the best fit for both fear groups. However, all size functions are likely to asymptote at 1, given that under full cue-viewing conditions size is going be bounded by a ratio of 1. Given the miniscule effect size for the intercepts between groups ( R 2 < .01) no statistical evidence was found to support the notion that effects of fear on size perception can be attributed to a simple linear shift. Discussion This experiment replicated the size results of Experiments 1a and 1c with a variety of target sizes, in that they overestimated size more when standing at the top of the height as compared to the bottom. However, the overestimation of size in this experiment was greater overall than in the previous experiments. We believe this may be due to the changed procedure, in which participants had to turn more to complete the matching task or it could also be related to the increased time spent on the height. A horizontal (control) viewing condition was added, and the distance and size estimates for the horizontal viewing condition were within the expected range. Therefore, it is unlikely that there was something special about the targets that produced a size overestimation in previous experiments. Participants also overestimated height more from the top than the bottom, also replicating Experiments 1a and 1c. However, a horizontal distance of the same extent as the balcony was underestimated, which is what was expected based on previous research ( Amorim, Loomis, & Fukusima, 1998 ; Cutting & Vishton, 1995 ; Loomis, Da Silva, Fujita, & Fukusima, 1992 ; Norman, Todd, Perotti, & Tittle, 1996 ). Participants’ estimates of size were related to their state-level ratings of fear. If they overestimated size, they were more likely to report feeling afraid of the height. This correlation was driven by participants who viewed the height from the top. Importantly, LMM analyses revealed that fear influenced the slope of the function of size estimates, not the intercept of the functions. This finding suggests that fear differentially influences the function of size estimates and is not due to a general tendency, in people who are afraid, to report every size as larger. There was no correlation between the trait-level ratings of fear and the overestimation of height for participants who viewed from the top or the bottom. A possible explanation for this null result is that participants gave their height estimate after estimating the size of each of the targets. The exposure time to the height was much longer in this experiment than in previous experiments because participants had to make many size estimates before making the height estimate and the fear estimate. This additional exposure time may have resulted in habituation to the height; accordingly, participants’ ratings of fear may have been reduced or conservative.  Experiment 2: Multiple Size Estimates from Top, Bottom and Horizontal Viewing Angles Experiment 2 tested whether participants overestimated height by examining a range of target sizes. In addition, a horizontal viewing condition was introduced to serve as a baseline for participants’ estimates of distance and size. This baseline was employed to confirm that there was nothing about the particular target used in the previous experiments that resulted in abnormal size or distance estimates. Also, repeated estimation of size allowed for a test of whether fear influences the slope of the function of size estimates or the intercept of the function.

There were 13 females in the horizontal viewing condition and bottom viewing conditions and 10 females in the top viewing condition. There were 11 males in the horizontal and bottom viewing conditions and 14 males in the top viewing condition. Apparatus The balcony used was the same as that described in Experiment 1a. Additional targets were added to test a range of sizes. The targets, all different colors, were made of core board. The pink target was 17.78 cm in diameter, the yellow target was 31.75 cm, the orange target (used in the previous experiments) was 45.72 cm, and the red target was 59.69 cm. For the horizontal viewing condition, the targets were displayed on a metal speaker stand that was 1.07 m tall. Magnets affixed to the back of the targets enabled them to be easily attached and removed from the top of the stand. The stand was placed 8 m from the participants’ feet along the horizontal ground plane. Design Participants were randomly assigned to the top, bottom, or horizontal viewing condition. Each participant estimated the size of each of the four target disks once. The order of presentation of the four targets was randomized. Each participant also made one estimate of the distance from oneself to the target disk viewed at that time. In the top viewing condition, participants estimated the distance from the top of the railing (approximately waist high) to the ground. In the horizontal and bottom viewing conditions, participants estimated the distance from their feet to the target. Procedure As in the previous experiments, the target was displayed for the participant and they adjusted a tape measure held by the experimenter to be the same length as the diameter of the target. The order of presentation of the targets was randomized and counterbalanced across conditions. Participants would turn (180 degrees) away while the targets were being switched by the other experimenter. After estimating the sizes of the four targets, participants were asked to estimate the distance to the final target by performing the visual matching task described in the previous experiments. Finally, all participants completed the SUDS and then the AQ. In addition, participants in the horizontal viewing condition were asked to report their general level of anxiety while standing on the horizontal ground plane for the SUDS. Results Size A 4 (target size) × 3 (condition) repeated measures ANOVA was performed with target size as a within-subjects variable and condition as a between-subjects variable. As expected, the analysis indicated a within-subjects effect of size, F (3,207) = 706.47, p < 0.0001, ? p 2 = 0.91 and a between-subjects effect of condition, F (1,69) = 10.68, p < 0.0001, ? p 2 = 0.24. Post-hoc analyses using Tukey’s HSD showed that participants in the top viewing condition estimated the size of the targets to be significantly greater than participants in the bottom and horizontal viewing conditions, p <0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively. This difference was significant for each target size (see Table 1 ). The horizontal and bottom conditions’ size estimates were not significantly different from one another, p = 0.51. There was no size × condition interaction, p = .07, though it trended toward significance. Height A one-way ANOVA comparing the visually matched estimates of distance for each condition revealed that there was an effect of condition on estimates of distance, F (1,69) = 55.80, p < 0.0001, ? p 2 = 0.61 (see Figure 6 ). Post-hoc analyses using Tukey’s HSD showed that the top ( M = 11.95, SD = 1.99), bottom ( M = 10.14, SD = 1.88), and horizontal ( M = 6.86, SD = 1.03) viewing conditions were all significantly different from each other, p = 0.001 for the bottom and top comparison , p < 0.0001 for the bottom and horizontal comparison, and p < 0.0001 for the top and horizontal comparison. The top viewing condition showed a 52% overestimation, the bottom condition showed a 29% overestimation and the horizontal condition underestimated the distance by 13%. There was no correlation between the last target size viewed and the distance estimate, p = 0.41, so it does not seem as if the finally viewed target size was related to participants’ estimates of the distance to the target. Fear Average error in size estimation was computed by subtracting actual size of the target from participants’ size estimates for that target. Underestimations of size were set to zero, though there were only a few underestimations and they were all in the horizontal viewing condition. Deviations from the actual size for each target size were added together and the resulting number was divided by four (the total number of targets). To test whether fear moderated the overestimation of height, average error in size estimates was correlated with participants’ SUDS ratings and their scores on the AQ. Participants’ scores on the two fear scales were correlated, r (71) = 0.36, p = 0.002. There was a positive correlation between participants’ SUDS ratings and the average error of their size estimates, r (71) = 0.30, p = 0.01 (see Figure 7 ). Participants who had higher state-level fear perceived larger targets. There was no relation between scores for the AQ and size estimates, p = 0.76 or distance estimates, p = 0.46. There was also no relation between participants’ height estimates and their SUDS ratings, p = 0.55. Linear mixed models (LMM) were used to calculate the intercepts and slopes for the ratios of perceived to actual size over the different targets sizes. This statistical method was chosen because it computes model parameter estimates (intercept and slope) while taking into account the repeated measures nature of the data. Separate LMM were computed for the low and high fear SUDS conditions. Intercept and participant were specified as random factors and target size was specified as a fixed factor. In addition, LMM allows for the specification of the appropriate variance structure (see Moser, 2004 ; Singer, 1998 ). An unstructured variance matrix provided the best fit for both models, indicating the residuals were not highly correlated in either SUDS condition. The slope of the low fear SUDS condition ( B 1 = -.022, SE = .002, t (32) = 9.73, p < .001) was significantly different from zero, as was the slope of the high fear condition ( B 1 = -.002, SE = .003, t (38) = 5.60, p < .001). Most importantly, the slope of the low fear condition was reliably steeper than that for the high fear condition, t (70) = 17.81, p <.001, d = 0.30, R 2 = .08 (see Figure 8 ). Both the intercept for the low fear condition ( B 0 = 1.623, SE = .048, t (32) = 33.93, p < .001) and high fear condition ( B 0 = 1.623, SE = .087, t (38) = 18.61, p < .001) were greater than zero. However, no reliable difference was found between intercepts, t (70) = .04, p =.97, d = .02, R 2 < .01. The slope results indicate fear differentially affects the function of size perception, with the gap in perceived size between the high and low fear groups increasing as targets become larger. Although the data in both conditions do not appear particularly linear, non-linear models were overspecified. This overspecification is probably due to having only 4 size estimates per participant. With an increased number and range of size estimates, it is certainly plausible that power functions with negative exponents could provide the best fit for both fear groups. However, all size functions are likely to asymptote at 1, given that under full cue-viewing conditions size is going be bounded by a ratio of 1. Given the miniscule effect size for the intercepts between groups ( R 2 < .01) no statistical evidence was found to support the notion that effects of fear on size perception can be attributed to a simple linear shift. Discussion This experiment replicated the size results of Experiments 1a and 1c with a variety of target sizes, in that they overestimated size more when standing at the top of the height as compared to the bottom. However, the overestimation of size in this experiment was greater overall than in the previous experiments. We believe this may be due to the changed procedure, in which participants had to turn more to complete the matching task or it could also be related to the increased time spent on the height. A horizontal (control) viewing condition was added, and the distance and size estimates for the horizontal viewing condition were within the expected range. Therefore, it is unlikely that there was something special about the targets that produced a size overestimation in previous experiments. Participants also overestimated height more from the top than the bottom, also replicating Experiments 1a and 1c. However, a horizontal distance of the same extent as the balcony was underestimated, which is what was expected based on previous research ( Amorim, Loomis, & Fukusima, 1998 ; Cutting & Vishton, 1995 ; Loomis, Da Silva, Fujita, & Fukusima, 1992 ; Norman, Todd, Perotti, & Tittle, 1996 ). Participants’ estimates of size were related to their state-level ratings of fear. If they overestimated size, they were more likely to report feeling afraid of the height. This correlation was driven by participants who viewed the height from the top. Importantly, LMM analyses revealed that fear influenced the slope of the function of size estimates, not the intercept of the functions. This finding suggests that fear differentially influences the function of size estimates and is not due to a general tendency, in people who are afraid, to report every size as larger. There was no correlation between the trait-level ratings of fear and the overestimation of height for participants who viewed from the top or the bottom. A possible explanation for this null result is that participants gave their height estimate after estimating the size of each of the targets. The exposure time to the height was much longer in this experiment than in previous experiments because participants had to make many size estimates before making the height estimate and the fear estimate. This additional exposure time may have resulted in habituation to the height; accordingly, participants’ ratings of fear may have been reduced or conservative.

Both the intercept for the low fear condition ( B 0 = 1.623, SE = .048, t (32) = 33.93, p < .001) and high fear condition ( B 0 = 1.623, SE = .087, t (38) = 18.61, p < .001) were greater than zero. However, no reliable difference was found between intercepts, t (70) = .04, p =.97, d = .02, R 2 < .01. The slope results indicate fear differentially affects the function of size perception, with the gap in perceived size between the high and low fear groups increasing as targets become larger. Although the data in both conditions do not appear particularly linear, non-linear models were overspecified. This overspecification is probably due to having only 4 size estimates per participant. With an increased number and range of size estimates, it is certainly plausible that power functions with negative exponents could provide the best fit for both fear groups. However, all size functions are likely to asymptote at 1, given that under full cue-viewing conditions size is going be bounded by a ratio of 1. Given the miniscule effect size for the intercepts between groups ( R 2 < .01) no statistical evidence was found to support the notion that effects of fear on size perception can be attributed to a simple linear shift.  Discussion This experiment replicated the size results of Experiments 1a and 1c with a variety of target sizes, in that they overestimated size more when standing at the top of the height as compared to the bottom. However, the overestimation of size in this experiment was greater overall than in the previous experiments. We believe this may be due to the changed procedure, in which participants had to turn more to complete the matching task or it could also be related to the increased time spent on the height. A horizontal (control) viewing condition was added, and the distance and size estimates for the horizontal viewing condition were within the expected range. Therefore, it is unlikely that there was something special about the targets that produced a size overestimation in previous experiments. Participants also overestimated height more from the top than the bottom, also replicating Experiments 1a and 1c. However, a horizontal distance of the same extent as the balcony was underestimated, which is what was expected based on previous research ( Amorim, Loomis, & Fukusima, 1998 ; Cutting & Vishton, 1995 ; Loomis, Da Silva, Fujita, & Fukusima, 1992 ; Norman, Todd, Perotti, & Tittle, 1996 ). Participants’ estimates of size were related to their state-level ratings of fear. If they overestimated size, they were more likely to report feeling afraid of the height. This correlation was driven by participants who viewed the height from the top. Importantly, LMM analyses revealed that fear influenced the slope of the function of size estimates, not the intercept of the functions. This finding suggests that fear differentially influences the function of size estimates and is not due to a general tendency, in people who are afraid, to report every size as larger. There was no correlation between the trait-level ratings of fear and the overestimation of height for participants who viewed from the top or the bottom. A possible explanation for this null result is that participants gave their height estimate after estimating the size of each of the targets. The exposure time to the height was much longer in this experiment than in previous experiments because participants had to make many size estimates before making the height estimate and the fear estimate. This additional exposure time may have resulted in habituation to the height; accordingly, participants’ ratings of fear may have been reduced or conservative.

Experiment 3: Triangulated walking measure of height from top and bottom viewing angles This experiment tested whether people overestimated heights with a visually directed action measure. Heights viewed from the top should be overestimated with a triangulated walking measure, given that this task is an indirect measure of distance perception ( Fukusima, Loomis, & Da Silva, 1997 ; Loomis et al., 1992 ). However, as stated previously, this task may measure apparent location rather than apparent distance. This is particularly true when an observer is standing at the top of a vertical extent because eye height information cannot be substituted for distance information as it can be when an observer is on the ground plane. Overall, this measure was employed because it is indirect and is not likely to be influenced by cognitions. Thus, participants would not have easily inferred the expected results and would not have been able to bias their responses accordingly. Moreover, blindwalking is a visually-guided action measure of distance perception that is usually accurate ( Fukusima et al., 1997 ; Loomis et al., 1992 ). Therefore, we wanted to test whether a relatively unbiased measure of distance perception, which also involved action, could be influenced by viewing a vertical extent rather than a horizontal one. Given the results of preliminary experiments done by Dilda, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson (2006) , a large overestimation of height was not predicted when viewing and blindwalking from the bottom. Dilda et al. showed that blindwalked estimates of the distance to targets placed on a ceiling were accurate up to approximately 6 meters. However, in this experiment, the degree of fear associated with the height was hypothesized to correlate with the amount of overestimation in the walking measure. Method Participants Twenty-eight University of Virginia undergraduates (19 female, 8 male) participated in the experiment for $5 or to satisfy a course requirement. There were 11 females in the bottom viewing condition and 8 in the top viewing condition. There were 3 males in the bottom viewing condition and 5 in the top viewing condition. Due to experimenter error, data for the SUDS and AQ were not recorded for two participants. Apparatus Participants viewed the orange target disk used in the previous experiments, from the same balcony as described in Experiment 1a. A blindfold was given to participants to perform the blindwalking task. A tape measure was used to measure the distance walked by the participant. Procedure Participants were randomly assigned to either the top or bottom viewing condition. The target was displaced 9 m to the left of the participants’ viewing positions when they were on the top and to the right of the participants’ viewing positions when they were on the bottom. The participant viewed the target from this alternate position and then walked without vision along a straight, oblique path until the participant believed he or she was directly above or below the target’s location (methodology adapted from Loomis et al., 1992 , see Figure 9 ). The distance that the observer walked served as his estimate of perceived distance to the target. In both conditions, the experimenter walked next to the participant while they blindwalked so as to limit veering from a straight path and to ensure safety. After participants completed the estimate, their walked distance was measured with the tape measure. All participants gave a SUDS rating after blindwalking to the target and completed the AQ after giving their blindwalked and SUDS estimates. Results Height Participants in the top viewing condition walked significantly farther than participants in the bottom viewing condition (see Figure 10 ). A one-way ANOVA showed that blindwalked estimates of distance on the top ( M = 11.84, SD = 2.11) were significantly larger than those on the bottom ( M = 8.88, SD = 1.04), F (1, 26) = 22.26, p < 0.0001, ? p 2 = 0.44. Participants who viewed the height from the top overestimated the distance to walk by 30%, whereas participants who viewed the height from the bottom underestimated the distance to walk by 2%. Fear As in most of the previous experiments, participants’ scores on the AQ and their SUDS ratings were highly correlated, r (26) = 0.79, p < 0.0001. There was no relation between SUDS ratings and blindwalked estimates on the top, p = 0.90, or the bottom, p = 0.70. There was also no relation between participants’ blindwalked estimates of height and their scores on the AQ for the top, p = 0.85, or the bottom, p = 0.65. Discussion With an indirect, visually guided action measure of distance, heights were overestimated more from the top than from the bottom. In this experiment, participants who viewed from the bottom were fairly accurate when blindwalking to the location of the target. This result was not surprising given recent research by Dilda et al. (2006) . However, the overestimation of distance from the top is surprising, because participants in the top condition were likely scared when they walked blindfolded on the balcony. The anxiety associated with walking blindfolded on a balcony could have resulted in an underestimation, so the distance walked by participants may have been conservative even though it was overestimated. Interestingly, the height overestimation in this experiment was less than in the previous experiments by a small amount. The fear associated with walking on the height may have attributed to the reduction of the effect. State- and trait-level fear ratings did not correlate with the blindwalked estimates of height. This result was expected for estimates made from the bottom, but not from the top. However, participants in this experiment had a much shorter exposure period to the height, so this lack of exposure could be a factor in the lack of correlation. Additionally, participants did not look straight over the railing in this experiment as in previous experiments. Instead, they had to look down and to their side, so “leaning” over the railing was less prevalent. Because the leaning is likely to increase feelings of fear, the participants in this experiment may not have experienced the same level of fear as in previous experiments. Or, it is possible that visually-guided action measures are not influenced by fear in the same manner as visually matched distance or size estimates.

General Discussion The experiments reported in this paper support the hypothesis that heights are consistently and reliably overestimated more from the top than the bottom. Experiment 1a and 1c demonstrated that heights are overestimated more from the top using both direct and indirect measures of vertical extent in two different locations. Experiment 1b showed that this overestimation from the top was smaller when the height was small. Experiment 1b also demonstrated that, in general, the act of looking down did not produce the overestimation seen in Experiments 1a and 1c. Experiment 2 replicated Experiments 1a and 1c using multiple target sizes. All of the sizes were overestimated from the top, but not from the bottom. A horizontal viewing condition was also added as a control, and the results replicated previous findings in the perception of spatial layout: horizontal distances were slightly underestimated and size estimates from a horizontal distance were fairly accurate. Therefore, the specific targets used in these experiments did not produce the overestimation of size. Experiment 3 replicated the overestimation of height from the top with another indirect measure of extent: triangulation by blindwalking. In this experiment, participants estimated height by walking until they believed they were directly above or below a target that was displaced from them horizontally. Participants who viewed the target from the top of the balcony overshot it, suggesting an overestimation of the perceived vertical distance to the target. With regard to fear influencing height, correlational data in Experiment 1a revealed that the overestimation of height was related to both state- and trait-level fear. People who were afraid overestimated height more than people who were unafraid. These results were partially replicated in Experiments 1c and 2. In those experiments, participants who reported higher state-level fear overestimated the size of the targets more. In Experiment 3, participants’ height and size estimates did not correlate with their state- or trait-level reports of fear. Further discussion of the findings and lack of findings for an influence of fear on perception will be discussed after discussion of the primary finding: heights are overestimated more from the top than the bottom. Optical Cues to Distance and the Overestimation of Height The major finding of this paper is that the overestimation of heights from the top compared to the bottom is extremely large when considered in the context of other normative biases in the perception of spatial layout. For instance, the maximum overestimation of height observed in the horizontal-vertical illusion in the real world is only 10 to15% (Yang et al., 1998). Similarly, maximum distance underestimation in outdoor environments is typically 10% ( Amorim, Loomis, & Fukusima, 1998 ; Cutting & Vishton, 1995 ; Loomis, Da Silva, Fujita, & Fukusima, 1992 ; Norman, Todd, Perotti, & Tittle, 1996 ). In the experiments presented, the overestimation of height from the top was greater than 30% for each of the locations and measures employed. Why was the overestimation so large? There are a variety of reasons why people may overestimate heights more from the top than the bottom. First, the top view lacks optical variables that often specify depth on the horizontal ground plane. For example, texture gradient is difficult to see when looking down from the top of the balcony, but easy to see from the bottom of the balcony looking up (see Figure 11 ). Therefore, the texture gradient provided by the bricks of the building could be a valuable cue to distance when viewing from the bottom. Likewise, the horizon and the observer’s eye height are useless cues for distance when viewing from the top because the observer is not standing on a true ground plane. As stated at the beginning of this paper, the reduction of optical cues to distance usually leads to an underestimation of distance with a variety of distance measures ( Gogel, 1965 ; Philbeck & Loomis, 1997 ). Assuming the overestimation of height in these experiments was due to the lack of optical cues for distance from the top, then it would be interesting to directly manipulate optical variables to test that assumption in future studies. 1 That people overestimated heights from the top – from an impoverished viewing condition with respect to available cues to scale distances – was surprising and challenges predictions from previous research on horizontal distance estimation in reduced cue environments. Even if viewing the height from the top was considered a full cue viewing condition, the results would be surprising, because most studies show accurate distance perception in full cue environments with a variety of measures ( Elliott, 1987 ; Fukusima et al., 1997 ; Gogel, 1976, 1979; Loomis et al., 1992 ; Rieser et al., 1990 ; Thomson, 1980, 1983 ). Does Fear Influence the Overestimation of Height? Another possible reason why the reduction of cues to distance resulted in an over-rather than an underestimation is that participants’ fear may have affected their height perceptions. If physiological fear is influential in the scaling of perceived height, then participants would be more likely to overestimate than underestimate. Previous work showed that participants were more likely to overestimate an uphill distance than the same distance on flat ground, even when geometry predicted that they should underestimate up-hill extents ( Stefanucci, Proffitt, Banton, & Epstein, 2005 ). This overestimation was attributed to the role of bio-energetic effort in scaling perceived distances. Participants may have overestimated uphill distances due to the increased effort associated with ascending hills as opposed to walking on level ground. In a similar vein, fear may play a role in perceiving large, potentially dangerous, vertical extents. The evidence in these studies regarding the influence of fear on perception is inconclusive. The results of Experiments 1a, 1c, and 2 are surprising in that they were obtained with students who were, on average, not afraid of heights. However, as Jackson and Cormack (2007) discussed, perceiving heights to be taller from the top has obvious evolutionary advantages. We believe that a better way to approach the question of whether fear influences the perception of height would be to test groups of individuals who are more or less afraid of heights. In fact, research done with collaborators in clinical psychology found that people with a higher trait-level fear of heights show increased overestimation of heights from the top in normative situations and when the consequences of the heights are magnified with an imagery task ( Clerkin, Cody, Stefanucci, Proffitt, & Teachman, 2008 ; Teachman, Stefanucci, Clerkin, Cody, & Proffitt, 2008 ). Recent research also suggests that fear may not only influence perception, but also behavior in height environments. A set of studies conducted by Pijpers, Oudejans, Holsheimer, and Bakker (2003) found that anxiety associated with rock climbing produced both physiological and behavioral changes in novice climbers. Climbers who were asked to take a higher route on the climbing wall (as opposed to a lower, safer route) exhibited significantly higher heart rates, more muscle fatigue, and higher blood lactate concentrations. The climbers who took the higher route also took longer to climb the route (even when route distance was equated), suggesting that the anxiety influenced their behavioral performance. In more recent work, this group has found that maximum reachability of climbers was influenced by anxiety, which also resulted in the use of more holds while actually climbing ( Pijpers, Oudejans, Bakker, & Beek, 2006 ). They also showed that climbers who were more anxious detected fewer lights in an attention task performed during climbing. Overall, their results suggest that anxiety can influence the perception of affordances. We believe that novice climbers would also perceive the heights as higher than advanced climbers and that this would be an interesting future study to pursue. Finally, recent work on the influence of fear on distance perception manipulated one component of fear – arousal – to ascertain whether it was sufficient to produce changes in both height and horizontal distance perception ( Stefanucci & Storbeck, 2008 ). Interestingly, the findings showed that participants who were aroused from viewing arousing images overestimated a height from the top, but not a horizontal extent when compared to participants who were not aroused. This suggests that the perception of horizontal extents may be unaffected by manipulations of arousal. An important step would be to identify whether certain fear manipulations that are relevant for horizontal distance estimation might affect the perception of distance on flat ground. For example, if people were asked to judge distances either to a fearful object or across a fearful object (like a spider or snake) than they may show differences in horizontal distance perception (i.e., people with spider fear may be more likely to judge the distance to a spider as shorter than people who are unafraid).  General Discussion The experiments reported in this paper support the hypothesis that heights are consistently and reliably overestimated more from the top than the bottom. Experiment 1a and 1c demonstrated that heights are overestimated more from the top using both direct and indirect measures of vertical extent in two different locations. Experiment 1b showed that this overestimation from the top was smaller when the height was small. Experiment 1b also demonstrated that, in general, the act of looking down did not produce the overestimation seen in Experiments 1a and 1c. Experiment 2 replicated Experiments 1a and 1c using multiple target sizes. All of the sizes were overestimated from the top, but not from the bottom. A horizontal viewing condition was also added as a control, and the results replicated previous findings in the perception of spatial layout: horizontal distances were slightly underestimated and size estimates from a horizontal distance were fairly accurate. Therefore, the specific targets used in these experiments did not produce the overestimation of size. Experiment 3 replicated the overestimation of height from the top with another indirect measure of extent: triangulation by blindwalking. In this experiment, participants estimated height by walking until they believed they were directly above or below a target that was displaced from them horizontally. Participants who viewed the target from the top of the balcony overshot it, suggesting an overestimation of the perceived vertical distance to the target. With regard to fear influencing height, correlational data in Experiment 1a revealed that the overestimation of height was related to both state- and trait-level fear. People who were afraid overestimated height more than people who were unafraid. These results were partially replicated in Experiments 1c and 2. In those experiments, participants who reported higher state-level fear overestimated the size of the targets more. In Experiment 3, participants’ height and size estimates did not correlate with their state- or trait-level reports of fear. Further discussion of the findings and lack of findings for an influence of fear on perception will be discussed after discussion of the primary finding: heights are overestimated more from the top than the bottom. Optical Cues to Distance and the Overestimation of Height The major finding of this paper is that the overestimation of heights from the top compared to the bottom is extremely large when considered in the context of other normative biases in the perception of spatial layout. For instance, the maximum overestimation of height observed in the horizontal-vertical illusion in the real world is only 10 to15% (Yang et al., 1998). Similarly, maximum distance underestimation in outdoor environments is typically 10% ( Amorim, Loomis, & Fukusima, 1998 ; Cutting & Vishton, 1995 ; Loomis, Da Silva, Fujita, & Fukusima, 1992 ; Norman, Todd, Perotti, & Tittle, 1996 ). In the experiments presented, the overestimation of height from the top was greater than 30% for each of the locations and measures employed. Why was the overestimation so large? There are a variety of reasons why people may overestimate heights more from the top than the bottom. First, the top view lacks optical variables that often specify depth on the horizontal ground plane. For example, texture gradient is difficult to see when looking down from the top of the balcony, but easy to see from the bottom of the balcony looking up (see Figure 11 ). Therefore, the texture gradient provided by the bricks of the building could be a valuable cue to distance when viewing from the bottom. Likewise, the horizon and the observer’s eye height are useless cues for distance when viewing from the top because the observer is not standing on a true ground plane. As stated at the beginning of this paper, the reduction of optical cues to distance usually leads to an underestimation of distance with a variety of distance measures ( Gogel, 1965 ; Philbeck & Loomis, 1997 ). Assuming the overestimation of height in these experiments was due to the lack of optical cues for distance from the top, then it would be interesting to directly manipulate optical variables to test that assumption in future studies. 1 That people overestimated heights from the top – from an impoverished viewing condition with respect to available cues to scale distances – was surprising and challenges predictions from previous research on horizontal distance estimation in reduced cue environments. Even if viewing the height from the top was considered a full cue viewing condition, the results would be surprising, because most studies show accurate distance perception in full cue environments with a variety of measures ( Elliott, 1987 ; Fukusima et al., 1997 ; Gogel, 1976, 1979; Loomis et al., 1992 ; Rieser et al., 1990 ; Thomson, 1980, 1983 ). Does Fear Influence the Overestimation of Height? Another possible reason why the reduction of cues to distance resulted in an over-rather than an underestimation is that participants’ fear may have affected their height perceptions. If physiological fear is influential in the scaling of perceived height, then participants would be more likely to overestimate than underestimate. Previous work showed that participants were more likely to overestimate an uphill distance than the same distance on flat ground, even when geometry predicted that they should underestimate up-hill extents ( Stefanucci, Proffitt, Banton, & Epstein, 2005 ). This overestimation was attributed to the role of bio-energetic effort in scaling perceived distances. Participants may have overestimated uphill distances due to the increased effort associated with ascending hills as opposed to walking on level ground. In a similar vein, fear may play a role in perceiving large, potentially dangerous, vertical extents. The evidence in these studies regarding the influence of fear on perception is inconclusive. The results of Experiments 1a, 1c, and 2 are surprising in that they were obtained with students who were, on average, not afraid of heights. However, as Jackson and Cormack (2007) discussed, perceiving heights to be taller from the top has obvious evolutionary advantages. We believe that a better way to approach the question of whether fear influences the perception of height would be to test groups of individuals who are more or less afraid of heights. In fact, research done with collaborators in clinical psychology found that people with a higher trait-level fear of heights show increased overestimation of heights from the top in normative situations and when the consequences of the heights are magnified with an imagery task ( Clerkin, Cody, Stefanucci, Proffitt, & Teachman, 2008 ; Teachman, Stefanucci, Clerkin, Cody, & Proffitt, 2008 ). Recent research also suggests that fear may not only influence perception, but also behavior in height environments. A set of studies conducted by Pijpers, Oudejans, Holsheimer, and Bakker (2003) found that anxiety associated with rock climbing produced both physiological and behavioral changes in novice climbers. Climbers who were asked to take a higher route on the climbing wall (as opposed to a lower, safer route) exhibited significantly higher heart rates, more muscle fatigue, and higher blood lactate concentrations. The climbers who took the higher route also took longer to climb the route (even when route distance was equated), suggesting that the anxiety influenced their behavioral performance. In more recent work, this group has found that maximum reachability of climbers was influenced by anxiety, which also resulted in the use of more holds while actually climbing ( Pijpers, Oudejans, Bakker, & Beek, 2006 ). They also showed that climbers who were more anxious detected fewer lights in an attention task performed during climbing. Overall, their results suggest that anxiety can influence the perception of affordances. We believe that novice climbers would also perceive the heights as higher than advanced climbers and that this would be an interesting future study to pursue. Finally, recent work on the influence of fear on distance perception manipulated one component of fear – arousal – to ascertain whether it was sufficient to produce changes in both height and horizontal distance perception ( Stefanucci & Storbeck, 2008 ). Interestingly, the findings showed that participants who were aroused from viewing arousing images overestimated a height from the top, but not a horizontal extent when compared to participants who were not aroused. This suggests that the perception of horizontal extents may be unaffected by manipulations of arousal. An important step would be to identify whether certain fear manipulations that are relevant for horizontal distance estimation might affect the perception of distance on flat ground. For example, if people were asked to judge distances either to a fearful object or across a fearful object (like a spider or snake) than they may show differences in horizontal distance perception (i.e., people with spider fear may be more likely to judge the distance to a spider as shorter than people who are unafraid).

Conclusions Two important findings emerge from this paper. First, heights are overestimated more from the top than the bottom. This overestimation is robust and proportionally larger than most other normative biases in the perception of spatial layout. Moreover, because the overestimation occurs using both direct and indirect measures of perception, there is good reason to believe that a perceptual bias rather than a cognitive bias causes this overestimation. Secondly, the results preliminarily indicate that fear may influence the overestimation of height. In three of the experiments the overestimation correlated with reports of fear. Though the fear results were mixed, the preliminary evidence for an influence of fear on the perception of height is promising and is being followed up ( Stefanucci & Storbeck, 2008 ; Teachman, Stefanucci, Clerkin, Cody, & Proffitt, 2008 ). Further investigation is needed before an influence of fear on height perception can be realized.
