Stroke in Minorities Synopsis Minorities in the United States have higher stroke risks, stroke occurrence at an earlier age, and for some groups, more severe strokes than non-Hispanic whites. Factors contributing to this disparity are explored. Characteristics of African American, Hispanic, and Native American stroke risk and incidence are reviewed. We mention recent interventions to raise the awareness of stroke risk factors and symptoms in minorities. The importance of the problem is discussed, and we suggest ways stroke in minorities may be reduced.  Conclusion Overall, African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans have higher stroke risks, stroke occurrence at an earlier age, and for some minorities possibly more severe strokes than non-Hispanic whites. The higher prevalence of risk factors, overall lower socioeconomic status, and health care system challenges for minority patients may contribute to stroke disparities. Stroke is a substantial burden on many minorities in terms of mortality, lost wages, and disability. There are steps, however, that we can take that may reduce this disparity. For example, sensitivity to the difficulties minority patients may have in negotiating a complicated health care system and doing what we can to reduce barriers to access to care may be important practice principles. We can do better in establishing rapport with our patients by better understanding their concerns and the cultural framework that underlie their behaviors and decision making. Whenever possible we should use interpreters to facilitate communication when we do not speak the native language of our patients. Being proactive in recognizing vascular risk factors and doing what it takes to reduce them is essential. We can target populations at risk with programs to heighten awareness of stroke symptoms and risk factors. Informing young people about stroke not only influences the next generation at risk for vascular disease, but also helps their parents and other older family members and friends better understand these disorders, their risk factors, prevention measures, and treatment. By determining what works to change behavior and by breaking down barriers to care we take critical steps toward reducing stroke disparities.
