TGF-?: A New Role for an Old AktTOR Nutrient overabundance is known to promote cellular hypertrophy, a significant pathological event in diseases like diabetes and cancer, although mechanisms have remained unclear. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Wu and Derynck provide a new model that links metabolism and cell growth by demonstrating that hyperglycemia can increase TGF-?-dependent activation of the mTOR pathway to promote cellular hyperplasia.
