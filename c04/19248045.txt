The Treatment of Multiple Myeloma Utilizing Vincristine, Carmustine (BCNU), Melphalan, Cyclophosphamide, and Prednisone (VBMCP) Alternating with High-Dose Cyclophosphamide and Alpha 2 Beta-Interferon Versus VBMCP Results of a Phase III Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study E5A93 Background A randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that aggressive initial therapy utilizing high-dose cyclophosphamide and alpha-2-interferon may be superior to standard combination alkylating agent regimens in the treatment of newly diagnosed myeloma. Methods This Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial evaluated 268 previously untreated patients with active multiple myeloma randomized to vincristine, carmustine (BCNU), melphalan, cyclophosphamide and prednisone (VBMCP) or VBMCP plus high-dose cyclophosphamide (HiCy) and recombinant ?2? interferon (IFN). Results The overall objective response was 62% in the VBMCP regimen and 68% in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN group. The near complete response (NCR) and complete response (CR) rates were 8.1% and 8.9%, respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) was 22.1 and 25.3 months, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) for patients treated with VBMCP was 37.1 months and 41.3 months for those treated with VBMCP + HiCy + IFN (P=0.38). The 5-year overall survival rates were not significantly different between the two arms, 26.4% and 33%, respectively. Lethal toxicities occurred in 15 patients, including 10 from infection, but there was no significant difference in lethal toxicities between the two regimens. Conclusion The study showed no significant benefit with the addition of high-dose cyclophosphamide and alpha-2 interferon to VBMCP.  PATIENTS AND METHODS Patient Selection and Accrual This study was conducted as ECOG protocol EST-E5A93 between April 1994 and December 2002. Eligibility required a new diagnosis of MM confirmed by either bone marrow plasmacytosis of at least 10% or biopsy-proven plasmacytoma as well as documented M protein in either serum or urine or characteristic osteolytic bone lesions. Measurable disease consisted of a serum M-protein level > 1 g/dL and urine monoclonal light chain excretion > 200 mg/24 h. or measurable soft tissue plasmacytoma. Patients with prior chemotherapy, smoldering multiple myeloma, localized plasmacytoma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance were excluded. Patients were required to have adequate organ and marrow function as defined by absolute neutrophils ? 1,000 mm3; platelets ? 50,000/ mm3; creatinine ? 5.0 mg/dL; bilirubin ? 2 mg/dL; SGOT ? 2.5 times upper limit of normal; and alkaline phosphatase ? 2.5 times upper limit of normal. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to entry. Treatment Plan Step 1 (induction) consisted of VBMCP (vincristine 1.2 mg/m2 [not to exceed 2.0 mg] IV day 1, BCNU 20 mg/m2 IV day 1, melphalan 8 mg/m2 PO days 1 - 4, cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m2 IV day 1, and prednisone 40 mg/ m2 PO days 1 - 7). Following 2 cycles of VBMCP given 35 days apart, patients entered step 2 (consolidation). In step 2, patients were randomized to Arm A, which consisted of VBMCP as above every 35 days or Arm B (VBMCP + high-dose cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV days 1- 4 plus prednisone 100 mg/m2 PO days 1 - 4 on cycles 3 and 5. ( Fig. 1 ). VBMCP was administered every even cycle starting with cycle 4, and IFN was given every odd cycle starting with cycle 7 at a dose of 5.0 × 106 U/m2 3 times weekly for 10 doses each cycle. Patients who obtained a plateau or complete response within 1 year continued treatment until 1 year from study entry. If a plateau or CR was achieved after 1 year, patients received 2 additional cycles of VBMCP and 2 cycles of IFN in arm B. Stratification factors included serum creatinine < 2.0 mg/dL and ? 2.0 – 5.0 mg/dL, performance status 0 - 1 and 2 - 4, plasma cell labeling index (PCLI) < 2%, ? 2% and beta-2 microglobulin < 4 mcg/mL, ? 4 mcg/mL. Treatment was discontinued in all patients at 2 years. Patients who had documented unequivocal progression or intolerable toxicity were removed from the study. All patients were observed until relapse or disease progression. Patients who relapsed or progressed after 3 months or more on observation received re-induction with their initial randomized regimen. Ciprofloxacin (500 mg b.i.d.) was strongly encouraged following each high-dose cyclophosphamide cycle. G-CSF 5 mcg/kg was given subcutaneously beginning on day 5 of each high-dose cyclophosphamide cycle and continued until the ANC reached 1,000/mm3. Dose Modification The initial cycle of chemotherapy was given at full dose regardless of blood counts. However, patients with creatinine 2.0 to 5.0 mg/dL received a 50% reduction of the calculated dosage for melphalan, BCNU, and cyclophosphamide. For second and subsequent cycles of chemotherapy, dosage modifications for melphalan, BCNU, and cyclophosphamide were calculated according to the leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet values. There was no dose modification for the two high-dose cyclophosphamide courses. IFN dosage was modified depending on the level of toxicity. Toxicity was evaluated using standard ECOG criteria 13 . All patients were followed to document the occurrence of a second malignancy. Response was evaluated using ECOG criteria. The criteria for objective response required ? 50% decrease in serum M protein and ? 50% reduction in the urine M protein if both were measurable. If the patient had light chain only, a 90% decrease in the 24-hour excretion of light chain was required. Objective response (OR) required a 50% decrease in the product of the cross diameters of any soft tissue plasmacytoma. There must be no progression of skeletal lytic lesions or persistence of hypercalcemia. Complete response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance of M protein from the serum defined by immunofixation and complete disappearance of M protein from the urine by immunofixation. The bone marrow aspirate/biopsy must contain ? 3% plasma cells. There must be no evidence of progressive disease by other parameters. A near-complete response (NCR) was defined as negative immunofixation of serum and urine but lacking a repeat bone marrow, or 3% - 6% bone marrow plasma cells remaining, or evidence of myeloma in the biopsy. Patients meeting objective response criteria but not CR or NCR were considered to have a partial response (PR). Disease progression was defined as an increase in serum M protein of 50% greater than the lowest response level and to a level of at least 1 g/dL, or an increase in urine light chain to 50% above the lowest response level if the resultant level exceeded 250 mg per 24 hours, new soft tissue plasmacytomas or an increase in existing plasmacytomas by 50%. The appearance of new lytic lesions or an increase of 50% in existing lesions constituted progression. Hypercalcemia > 12 mg/dL, hemoglobin decrease of 2.0 g/dL, increased bone marrow plasma cells > 50% or generalized bone pain all constituted progression. Statistical Methods The 2-sided Fisher's exact test 14 was used to test whether there were significant differences between treatment arms and patient characteristics. The 2-sided Wilcoxon test 15 was used to test whether there were significant differences between treatment arms in continuous patient characteristics. It was further used to compare the number of treatment cycles received between treatment arms. The 2-sided Fisher's exact test was also used to compare response and toxicity rates between treatment arms. Survival distributions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method 16 . Survival comparisons were performed using the 1-sided logrank test 17 for the primary overall survival (OS) analysis between treatment arms and the 2-sided logrank test for all other OS analyses and all PFS progression-free survival analyses. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess potential interaction 18 . Nominal P values were adjusted based on actual information time observed. For all other comparisons, a P value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant.  Patient Selection and Accrual This study was conducted as ECOG protocol EST-E5A93 between April 1994 and December 2002.

Written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to entry.  Treatment Plan Step 1 (induction) consisted of VBMCP (vincristine 1.2 mg/m2 [not to exceed 2.0 mg] IV day 1, BCNU 20 mg/m2 IV day 1, melphalan 8 mg/m2 PO days 1 - 4, cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m2 IV day 1, and prednisone 40 mg/ m2 PO days 1 - 7). Following 2 cycles of VBMCP given 35 days apart, patients entered step 2 (consolidation). In step 2, patients were randomized to Arm A, which consisted of VBMCP as above every 35 days or Arm B (VBMCP + high-dose cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV days 1- 4 plus prednisone 100 mg/m2 PO days 1 - 4 on cycles 3 and 5. ( Fig. 1 ). VBMCP was administered every even cycle starting with cycle 4, and IFN was given every odd cycle starting with cycle 7 at a dose of 5.0 × 106 U/m2 3 times weekly for 10 doses each cycle. Patients who obtained a plateau or complete response within 1 year continued treatment until 1 year from study entry. If a plateau or CR was achieved after 1 year, patients received 2 additional cycles of VBMCP and 2 cycles of IFN in arm B. Stratification factors included serum creatinine < 2.0 mg/dL and ? 2.0 – 5.0 mg/dL, performance status 0 - 1 and 2 - 4, plasma cell labeling index (PCLI) < 2%, ? 2% and beta-2 microglobulin < 4 mcg/mL, ? 4 mcg/mL.

It was further used to compare the number of treatment cycles received between treatment arms. The 2-sided Fisher's exact test was also used to compare response and toxicity rates between treatment arms. Survival distributions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method 16 . Survival comparisons were performed using the 1-sided logrank test 17 for the primary overall survival (OS) analysis between treatment arms and the 2-sided logrank test for all other OS analyses and all PFS progression-free survival analyses. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess potential interaction 18 . Nominal P values were adjusted based on actual information time observed. For all other comparisons, a P value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant.  RESULTS Two-hundred-sixty-eight patients were entered on the study. Two-hundred-thirty-six patients entered step 2 (randomization to VBMCP versus VBMCP + HiCy + IFN). The patient characteristics of those eligible at randomization are shown in Table 1 . The median age was 64 years. The treatment groups were well balanced for the stratification factors, except that a higher frequency of pain and radiographic bone abnormalities were found in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN regimen and the hemoglobin level was lower in the VBMCP regimen. Treatment The median number of cycles of treatment was 9 for the VBMCP arm and 11 for VBMCP + HiCy + IFN (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients who completed the assigned treatment was the same in both regimens (57%). The most common reason for discontinuation of therapy was progressive disease (17% in VBMCP and 13% in VBMCP + HiCy + IFN). The other causes for discontinuation did not differ statistically between the 2 treatment arms. Death without progressive disease occurred in 3 patients receiving VBMCP compared to 5 patients on the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN regimen. Response to therapy The overall response by treatment is shown in Table 2 . The overall objective response was 62% in the VBMCP regimen and 68% in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN arm. There was no significant difference between the treatment arms in objective response rates (P=0.402). Complete responses were found in 3.6% and 8.9%, respectively, while NCR response rates occurred in 4.5% and 0.0%, respectively. Thus, the CR + NCR rates were 8.1% and 8.9%, respectively. The NCR were probably included with the CR patients in previous studies. Progression-free survival Two-hundred-eighteen patients were included in the analysis of progression-free survival (PFS). Five patients were excluded because they were unevaluable for response or progression or had insufficient follow-up data. Patients were counted as an event if they progressed or died without documented progression within 3 months of their last disease evaluation. For patients who had progressed, the PFS was calculated as the time from randomization to time of progression. For patients who died, either without documented progression or within three months of their last disease evaluation, the PFS time was calculated as the time from randomization to time of death. Further, the patients who died both without documented progression and greater than 3 months from their last disease evaluation (not counted as an event), the PFS time was calculated as the time from randomization to time of last disease evaluation. Just the same, the remaining patients who did not experience progression or die have a censored PFS time at date of their last disease evaluation. Among the 218 patients, 148 (68%) had events. The median PFS time was 22.1 months (18.4, 27.6, 95% CI) in the VBMCP arm and 25.3 months in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN arm (21.3, 35.2 95% CI). There was not a statistically significant difference between treatment arms (p = 0.135). There were no statistically significant differences in PFS when analyzed by gender or by race ( Table 3 , Figure 2 ). Overall survival The median follow-up time was 88.1 months in arm A and 75.5 months in arm B. One-hundred seventy-five patients (78.5%) of the 223 patients have died. There were 89 deaths (80.2%) in the VBMCP arm and 86 deaths (76.8%) in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN arm. The median OS for patients treated with VBMCP was 37.1 months (31.7, 46.1, 95% CI) and 41.3 months (34.1,50.9, 95% CI) for those treated with VBMCP + HiCy + IFN (P = 0.38). There were no significantly statistical differences in OS when analyzed by gender (P = 0.37) or by race ( Table 4 , Fig. 3 ). However, within the white race, median OS for those treated with VBMCP was 36.5 months (30.9, 47.6, 95% CI) compared those treated with VBMCP + HiCy + IFN who had a median OS of 46.4 months (37.3, 55.6, 95% CI) (P = .021) ( Table 5 ) The 5 year overall survival was 26.4% (18.2, 35.3, 95% CI) for VBMCP and 33% (24.1, 42.2, 95% CI) for VBMCP + HiCy + IFN. We also looked at overall survival in the two therapy regimens on the basis of beta-2-microglobulin values as well as the International Staging System 19 ( Table 6 and 7 ). Overall survival was slightly longer in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN regimen for patients with better prognostic features (beta-2-microglobulin ? 6 and Stage I ISS) but the difference was not statistically significant. Toxicity Step 1 (VBMCP only): The most common grade 3 or higher toxicity was granulocytopenia (35%) followed by leucopenia (32%). Only 6% had thrombocytopenia. Infection occurred in 11%. Step 2 The most frequent grade 3 or higher toxicity on the VBMCP arm was granulocytopenia (49.1%) and 84% in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN arm (p = <0.001). Grade 3 or higher infections were seen in 8.8% of VBMCP patients versus 25.5% on the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN regimen (p = 0.001). Cardiac toxicity was more common in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN regimen (10.4% compared with 0.9% with VBMCP (p = 0.002). Thrombocytopenia was similar with both regimens. Grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicity occurred in 41% of the VBMCP group and in 70% of the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN group (p < 0.001) ( Table 8 ). Lethal toxicities occurred in 15 patients: 6 during induction (Step 1), 7 during consolidation (Step 2), and 2 during reinduction (Step 4). Three patients were on the VBMCP regimen and 4 patients were on the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN arm in step 2. Ten of 15 deaths were from infection, while 2 died of pulmonary emboli, 2 had a cardiac death and one died of an undefined systemic inflammatory response. Myelodysplastic syndrome occurred in 7 patients (6 in VBMCP arm), with 1 developing an acute leukemia.  RESULTS Two-hundred-sixty-eight patients were entered on the study. Two-hundred-thirty-six patients entered step 2 (randomization to VBMCP versus VBMCP + HiCy + IFN). The patient characteristics of those eligible at randomization are shown in Table 1 . The median age was 64 years. The treatment groups were well balanced for the stratification factors, except that a higher frequency of pain and radiographic bone abnormalities were found in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN regimen and the hemoglobin level was lower in the VBMCP regimen.

The most common reason for discontinuation of therapy was progressive disease (17% in VBMCP and 13% in VBMCP + HiCy + IFN). The other causes for discontinuation did not differ statistically between the 2 treatment arms. Death without progressive disease occurred in 3 patients receiving VBMCP compared to 5 patients on the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN regimen.

There was no significant difference between the treatment arms in objective response rates (P=0.402). Complete responses were found in 3.6% and 8.9%, respectively, while NCR response rates occurred in 4.5% and 0.0%, respectively. Thus, the CR + NCR rates were 8.1% and 8.9%, respectively. The NCR were probably included with the CR patients in previous studies. Progression-free survival Two-hundred-eighteen patients were included in the analysis of progression-free survival (PFS). Five patients were excluded because they were unevaluable for response or progression or had insufficient follow-up data. Patients were counted as an event if they progressed or died without documented progression within 3 months of their last disease evaluation. For patients who had progressed, the PFS was calculated as the time from randomization to time of progression. For patients who died, either without documented progression or within three months of their last disease evaluation, the PFS time was calculated as the time from randomization to time of death.

There was not a statistically significant difference between treatment arms (p = 0.135). There were no statistically significant differences in PFS when analyzed by gender or by race ( Table 3 , Figure 2 ). Overall survival The median follow-up time was 88.1 months in arm A and 75.5 months in arm B. One-hundred seventy-five patients (78.5%) of the 223 patients have died. There were 89 deaths (80.2%) in the VBMCP arm and 86 deaths (76.8%) in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN arm. The median OS for patients treated with VBMCP was 37.1 months (31.7, 46.1, 95% CI) and 41.3 months (34.1,50.9, 95% CI) for those treated with VBMCP + HiCy + IFN (P = 0.38). There were no significantly statistical differences in OS when analyzed by gender (P = 0.37) or by race ( Table 4 , Fig. 3 ). However, within the white race, median OS for those treated with VBMCP was 36.5 months (30.9, 47.6, 95% CI) compared those treated with VBMCP + HiCy + IFN who had a median OS of 46.4 months (37.3, 55.6, 95% CI) (P = .021) ( Table 5 ) The 5 year overall survival was 26.4% (18.2, 35.3, 95% CI) for VBMCP and 33% (24.1, 42.2, 95% CI) for VBMCP + HiCy + IFN. We also looked at overall survival in the two therapy regimens on the basis of beta-2-microglobulin values as well as the International Staging System 19 ( Table 6 and 7 ). Overall survival was slightly longer in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN regimen for patients with better prognostic features (beta-2-microglobulin ? 6 and Stage I ISS) but the difference was not statistically significant. Toxicity Step 1 (VBMCP only): The most common grade 3 or higher toxicity was granulocytopenia (35%) followed by leucopenia (32%). Only 6% had thrombocytopenia. Infection occurred in 11%. Step 2 The most frequent grade 3 or higher toxicity on the VBMCP arm was granulocytopenia (49.1%) and 84% in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN arm (p = <0.001). Grade 3 or higher infections were seen in 8.8% of VBMCP patients versus 25.5% on the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN regimen (p = 0.001). Cardiac toxicity was more common in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN regimen (10.4% compared with 0.9% with VBMCP (p = 0.002). Thrombocytopenia was similar with both regimens. Grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicity occurred in 41% of the VBMCP group and in 70% of the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN group (p < 0.001) ( Table 8 ). Lethal toxicities occurred in 15 patients: 6 during induction (Step 1), 7 during consolidation (Step 2), and 2 during reinduction (Step 4). Three patients were on the VBMCP regimen and 4 patients were on the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN arm in step 2. Ten of 15 deaths were from infection, while 2 died of pulmonary emboli, 2 had a cardiac death and one died of an undefined systemic inflammatory response. Myelodysplastic syndrome occurred in 7 patients (6 in VBMCP arm), with 1 developing an acute leukemia.

The median PFS time was 22.1 months (18.4, 27.6, 95% CI) in the VBMCP arm and 25.3 months in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN arm (21.3, 35.2 95% CI). There was not a statistically significant difference between treatment arms (p = 0.135). There were no statistically significant differences in PFS when analyzed by gender or by race ( Table 3 , Figure 2 ).  Overall survival The median follow-up time was 88.1 months in arm A and 75.5 months in arm B. One-hundred seventy-five patients (78.5%) of the 223 patients have died. There were 89 deaths (80.2%) in the VBMCP arm and 86 deaths (76.8%) in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN arm. The median OS for patients treated with VBMCP was 37.1 months (31.7, 46.1, 95% CI) and 41.3 months (34.1,50.9, 95% CI) for those treated with VBMCP + HiCy + IFN (P = 0.38). There were no significantly statistical differences in OS when analyzed by gender (P = 0.37) or by race ( Table 4 , Fig. 3 ). However, within the white race, median OS for those treated with VBMCP was 36.5 months (30.9, 47.6, 95% CI) compared those treated with VBMCP + HiCy + IFN who had a median OS of 46.4 months (37.3, 55.6, 95% CI) (P = .021) ( Table 5 ) The 5 year overall survival was 26.4% (18.2, 35.3, 95% CI) for VBMCP and 33% (24.1, 42.2, 95% CI) for VBMCP + HiCy + IFN. We also looked at overall survival in the two therapy regimens on the basis of beta-2-microglobulin values as well as the International Staging System 19 ( Table 6 and 7 ). Overall survival was slightly longer in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN regimen for patients with better prognostic features (beta-2-microglobulin ? 6 and Stage I ISS) but the difference was not statistically significant.

Toxicity Step 1 (VBMCP only): The most common grade 3 or higher toxicity was granulocytopenia (35%) followed by leucopenia (32%). Only 6% had thrombocytopenia. Infection occurred in 11%. Step 2 The most frequent grade 3 or higher toxicity on the VBMCP arm was granulocytopenia (49.1%) and 84% in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN arm (p = <0.001). Grade 3 or higher infections were seen in 8.8% of VBMCP patients versus 25.5% on the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN regimen (p = 0.001). Cardiac toxicity was more common in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN regimen (10.4% compared with 0.9% with VBMCP (p = 0.002). Thrombocytopenia was similar with both regimens. Grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicity occurred in 41% of the VBMCP group and in 70% of the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN group (p < 0.001) ( Table 8 ). Lethal toxicities occurred in 15 patients: 6 during induction (Step 1), 7 during consolidation (Step 2), and 2 during reinduction (Step 4). Three patients were on the VBMCP regimen and 4 patients were on the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN arm in step 2. Ten of 15 deaths were from infection, while 2 died of pulmonary emboli, 2 had a cardiac death and one died of an undefined systemic inflammatory response. Myelodysplastic syndrome occurred in 7 patients (6 in VBMCP arm), with 1 developing an acute leukemia.

DISCUSSION The main aim of this study was to improve upon the theoretically most active inductive regimen consisting of VBMCP with high-dose cyclophosphamide in an effort to intensify the chemotherapeutic effect. The underlying hypothesis was that a more intense induction would lead to a higher quality and more durable response, and better overall survival. Thus a regimen employing a more intensive induction with VBMCP plus high-dose cyclophosphamide and alpha-2-IFN was compared to VBMCP in this phase III trial. At the time the study was designed, VBMCP appeared to be a promising alternative to MP and was therefore chosen as the control arm. The study was designed before the arrival of new agents such as thalidomide, lenalidomide and bortezomib. Thus the experimental arm used agents thought to possess additive anti-myeloma activity such as interferon and high-dose cyclophosphamide. 4 , 20 . Our study shows no significant difference in the overall response rate between the two arms; overall response was noted in 62% of patients in the VBMCP regimen versus 68% in the VBMCP plus HiCy plus IFN regimen, although the latter arm had a trend towards higher CR rates. Progression-free survival (PFS) was also not significantly different between the two arms; 22.1 months in the VBMCP arm versus 25.3 months in the VBMCP plus HiCy plus IFN regimen (P=0.135). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the median OS between the two arms, 37.1 months for VBMCP versus 41 months for those treated with VBMCP plus Hi-Cy plus IFN (P=0.38). We found that grade 3 or higher infections were more common in the VBMCP + HiCy + IFN regimen (25.5% vs. 8.8%), although deaths due to infection were not different in the 2 regimens. The incidence of MDS was low in this trial (2.6%). Since this trial was designed and accrued, interest in using VBMCP and other similar combination chemotherapy regimens in newly diagnosed patients has markedly decreased as a result of a series of trials that failed to show survival advantage compared with MP. In one randomized study of 479 previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma, the response rate for VBMCP was 72% versus 51% for MP. Response duration was also longer with VBMCP (median 24 months) compared to MP (median 18 months). However, overall survival for VBMCP (median 30 months) was not statistically different than that for MP (median 28 months) (P=0.30) 3 . A meta-analysis of randomized trials confirmed a lack of survival benefit with combination chemotherapy despite improved response rates 9 . Similarly, despite some studies showing modest efficacy with interferon as induction 4 or maintenance 21 , more recent studies 22 and meta-analysis have highlighted the limited value of interferon as anti-myeloma therapy. This study shows no benefit with the addition of high dose cyclophosphamide and interferon to the treatment regimen. In addition, there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two arms in either high-risk or low-risk patients based on beta-2-microglobulin values or the International Staging System. Although this may reflect the low therapeutic value of these agents in myeloma in the context of then available alkylator-based therapy, it may reflect that early administration of all available active agents in myeloma may not always be of clinical value in the absence of good preclinical data. Such a strategy also carries the risk of fewer options at the time of relapse. One of the lessons learnt from this trial are that in the future, given the number of new active agents for myeloma, clinical trials investigating multi-drug combinations to improve response and outcome should be based on strong preclinical data and with a clear hypothesis that can be tested during the conduct of the trial. In this trial the CR rate in both arms was low, and based upon what we know now it partly explains why the experimental arm did not result in a significant improvement in outcome. The present trial does have important limitations. Since the trial was designed, MPT 23 , 24 and VMP 25 have demonstrated an overall survival advantage to MP. Moreover, VBMCP is no longer recommended as initial therapy for most patients. This highlights the problems facing large cooperative group phase III trials in an era in which treatment advances are occurring rapidly. Endpoints such as PFS and OS require many years of follow up, and thus results of randomized trials run the risk of losing relevance by the time results are published. We conclude that VBMCP + HiCy + IFN was not significantly more effective than VBMCP alone. Neither regimen can now be recommended as initial therapy because of the arrival of novel agents including thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide. These regimens are active and may have an important role in relapsed multiple myeloma.
