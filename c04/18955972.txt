Caspase independent cell death: leaving the set without the final cut Apoptosis is dependent upon caspase activation leading to substrate cleavage and, ultimately, cell death. Although required for the apoptotic phenotype, it has become apparent that cells frequently die even when caspase function is blocked. This process, termed caspase independent cell death (CICD), occurs in response to most intrinsic apoptotic cues provided that mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation has occurred. Death receptor ligation can also trigger a form of CICD termed necroptosis. In this review we will examine the molecular mechanisms governing CICD, highlight recent findings demonstrating recovery from conditions of CICD and discuss potential pathophysiological roles for these processes.
