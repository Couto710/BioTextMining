Caffeine, Artificial Sweetener, and Fluid Intake in Anorexia Nerovsa Objective The current paper provides an analysis of the use of artificial sweeteners, caffeine, and excess fluids in patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. Method Seventy subjects with anorexia nervosa (AN) were recruited to participate in an ecologic momentary assessment study which included nutritional analysis using the Nutrition Data Systems for Research (NDS-R), a computer based dietary recall system. Results When subtypes were compared, AN-restricting subtype (AN-R) subjects and AN-Binge-Purge (AN-B/P) subjects did not differ in quantity of aspartame, caffeine, or water consumed. Daily water consumption was related to daily vomiting frequency in AN-B/P but not to daily exercise frequency in either AN-R or AN-B/P subjects. Conclusion Caffeine, water, and aspartame consumption can be variable in AN patients and the consumption of these substances appears to be only modestly related to purging behavior.

Conclusion Caffeine, water, and aspartame consumption can be variable in AN patients and the consumption of these substances appears to be only modestly related to purging behavior.  Method Subjects (N=70) were recruited from three sites in the Midwestern region of the United States. The sample included 43 AN-R and 27 AN-B/P subjects. Subjects were diagnosed using the SCID-I patient version. 15 Subjects recalled their consumption in person or over the phone on two or three separate days using the Nutrition Data Systems for Research (NDS-R), a system created at the Nutrition Coordinating Center in the Division of Epidemiology and School of Public Health at the University of Minnesota. Subjects were interviewed in the evening and data from the prior 24 hours were entered into the NDS-R by trained raters. The NDS-R system provides a nutrient and caloric breakdown of each food item consumed and has been shown to be a useful assessment tool. 16 , 17 Purging behaviors were assessed using ecologic momentary assessment (EMA) with palm top computers. 18 Subjects entered their exercise, vomiting, and laxative use episodes into the palm top computers over a two-week period when the instrument signaled them to do so. The instrument signaled participants at six semi-random times throughout the day. Participants were also instructed to record these behaviors if they occurred at a time other than when the participant was signaled. The EMA protocol coincided with the days the NDS-R was administered, allowing a temporal alignment of consumption and purging patterns for each subject. This research was reviewed and approved by an institutional review board.  Results The mean BMI of the sample was 17.3 (SD = .9) and the mean age was 24.8 (SD=7.8). The BMI for the AN-R group (M= 17.4 SD = 1.47) and AN-B/P group (M = 17.1, SD = 1.7) did not differ significantly (p = .337). The mean age of the AN-R (M = 23.8, SD= 7.2) and AN-B/P (M = 26.6, SD = 8.5) groups did not differ significantly (p = .147). Additional demographic information is provided in Table 1 . Subjects' entries in the NDS-R database included 785 eating episodes in the AN-R group and 431 eating episodes in the AN-B/P group. Water, caffeine, and aspartame consumption did not differ significantly between groups although the AN-B/P group consumed numerically more of each type of substance compared than the AN-R group. The results are shown in Table 2 . A mixed-effects linear model was used with water, caffeine, and aspartame each serving as a dependent variable in three analyses. Diagnosis and the hour of the meal served as the independent variables. Results of the consumption patterns are found in Table 3 . Water consumption did not significantly differ across diagnoses; however, water intake increased significantly across time of day. Most importantly, the two subtypes differed in their hourly pattern of fluid consumption. AN-R participants' consumption stayed somewhat consistent across time and AN-B/P subjects' intake increased ( Figure 1 ). No significant difference emerged in the aspartame consumption across diagnoses or time of day ( Figure 2 ). Caffeine use, similarly, did not differ across diagnoses but decreased in both groups as the day progressed ( Figure 3 ). Additional multilinear modeling was used to assess the relationship between the frequency of vomiting episodes per day and the quantity of water consumed per day in AN-B/P subjects. Results suggested that daily vomiting episodes were associated with greater water consumption. Neither caffeine nor water intake related to the number of exercise episodes of AN-R and AN-B/P subjects. Results are found in Table 5.

Discussion Prior literature has suggested that individuals with eating disorders may use excessive amounts of water, caffeine, and/or sweeteners. The purpose of the current study was to examine daily differences in consumption of these substances among AN-R and AN-B/P subjects. Using NDS-R to assess the quantity of the substance consumed throughout the day and EMA to assess purging behavior, the results of the investigation were only partially consistent with our hypotheses. Specifically, consumption of caffeine, sweeteners, and fluids appeared to be greater in the AN-B/P group, compared to AN-R group, but the differences were not statistically significant. Contrary to our hypothesis, caffeine use decreased throughout the day in both groups. Similarly, caffeine consumption was not related to exercise in either of the AN subgroups. The findings suggest that daily water consumption is related to increased number of vomiting episodes, but not to compensation for daily exercise episodes. Hart and colleagues note, “There are currently no published descriptions of fluid consumption patterns (type and amount) in patients with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS)” (p. 55) prior to their study. 1 Our description of consumption patterns are similar to those of Hart and colleagues who found no difference between fluid intake in eating disorder patients with and without purging behavior. 1 Also consistent with Hart and colleagues, the range of fluid consumption found in this research was quite diverse both between and within AN subtypes. 1 This variability suggests that some patients appear to limit intake, whereas others over-consume fluids. Indeed, fluid restriction and fluid over-consumption have both been documented in the literature. 5 , 14 , 19 The results of this study are not consistent with previous research that suggests ED subjects (AN, BN, and EDNOS) who binge eat and purge tend to consume more caffeine. 1 , 12 However, caffeine use decreased throughout the day in both AN-R and AN-B/P groups. This suggests that caffeine may not be used to increase energy throughout the day. To the authors' knowledge, only one other study has examined artificial sweetener use in ED subjects and our results are similar to that study. 3 In terms of sweetener consumption, the consumption of aspartame varied among AN-R and AN-B/P groups. AN-B/P subjects consumed more sweeteners than AN-R subjects. Aspartame consumption did not change significantly throughout the day. Klein and colleagues suggested that the drive for use of sweetener is likely related to “an appetitive drive in the eating-disordered populations” or “orosensory stimulation” (p. 344). 3 There are several limitations to the current study. First, subject recall was used to enter data into the NDS-R system for nutritional analysis. The NDS-R system relies on accurate reporting of the patient's consumption. Accurate report of consumption is especially challenging in a population that may be overly concerned about consumption patterns. In addition, our data analysis did not include a comparison of specific foods or drinks that contained sweeteners, fluids, and caffeine. Directly comparing the specific food products consumed, as opposed to only the nutritional breakdown of the foods, may provide additional information about the reasons for consumption. For example, chocolate that contains caffeine may have been ingested for the taste, and not necessarily for the stimulant effects. Moreover, an assessment of hunger and fullness rating when patients were signaled using their palm top computer would have been advantageous in examining the relationship between consumption of each substance and purging episodes. Lastly, our study did not include aged-matched, healthy control subjects which would have provided additional information about the severity of aberrant consumption patterns in the AN participants. Very little research has examined consumption of water, caffeine, and sweeteners among individuals with eating disorders and the inconsistency in the research findings thus far warrants addition investigation. It remains unclear as to the reasons for excessive consumption of these substances in eating disorder patients and closer analysis of patients' rationale or motivation to over-consume these nutritional components is needed. Our findings suggest that overconsumption of caffeine may not be for the purpose of increasing energy as was hypothesized by previous authors. Water consumption appeared to be related to some purging behaviors (i.e., vomit episodes), but not exercise episodes. The medical complications that can occur from overuse of the aforementioned substances speak to the clinical relevance of querying patients as to their overuse of caffeine, sweeteners, and water. Providing patient with education related to the medical sequelae secondary to the overuse of these substances is also indicated.
