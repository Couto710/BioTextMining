Serum YKL-40 and IL-6 Levels in Hodgkin Lymphoma Purpose Serum levels of the inflammatory markers YKL-40 and IL-6 are increased in many conditions, including cancers. We examined serum YKL-40 and IL-6 levels in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), a tumor with strong immunologic reaction to relatively few tumor cells, especially in nodular sclerosis HL. Experimental Design We analyzed Danish and Swedish patients with incident HL (N=470) and population controls from Denmark (N= 245 for YKL-40; N= 348 for IL-6). Serum YKL-40 and IL-6 levels were determined by ELISA, and log-transformed data were analysed by linear regression, adjusting for age and sex. Results Serum levels of YKL-40 and IL-6 were increased in HL patients compared to controls (YKL-40: 3.6-fold, IL-6: 8.3-fold; both p<0.0001). In samples from pre-treatment HL patients (N=176), levels were correlated with more advanced stages (ptrend 0.0001 for YKL-40 and 0.013 for IL-6) and in those with B symptoms, but levels were similar in nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity subtypes, by EBV status, and in younger (<45 years old) and older patients. Patients tested soon after treatment onset had significantly lower levels than pre-treatment patients, but even >6 months after treatment onset, serum YKL-40 and IL-6 levels remained significantly increased, compared to controls. In patients who died (N=12), pre-treatment levels for both YKL-40 and IL-6 were higher than in survivors, although not statistically significantly. Conclusions Serum YKL-40 and IL-6 levels were increased in untreated HL patients and those with more advanced stages but did not differ significantly by HL histology. Following treatment, serum levels were significantly lower.  Results Levels in healthy individuals (N=245 for YKL-40, N=348 for IL-6) are presented in Figure 1 . We used serum levels estimated in 35-year-old women as the reference value for statistical comparisons, 35 years being the median age of the HL cases. For YKL-40, this baseline serum level was 39 ng/mL. Serum YKL-40 levels increased by a factor of 1.15 per decade of age (95% CI: 1.12?1.19; ptrend=<0.0001), and the age-adjusted median level was lower in males than females by a factor of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.82?1.04). For serum IL-6, the baseline level was 1.3 pg/mL, and levels increased by a factor of 1.07 per decade of age (95% CI: 1.00?1.15; ptrend= 0.07). After age-adjustment, serum IL-6 levels in males were higher than females by a factor of 1.15 (95% CI: 0.98?1.34). The characteristics of the 470 HL patients in the present study are provided in Table 1 . Males and females were equally represented and the bimodal age distribution was typical of HL, as was the predominance (69%) of nodular sclerosis (NS) HL. For 388 patients, stage was known. For 98 patients, treatment status at the time of blood collection was not certain. The age, sex and histology distributions did not differ between cases with and without known treatment status, but YKL-40 and IL-6 levels were similar to those in treated patients, suggesting the majority of those without treatment information had been treated (data not presented). Among 176 HL patients with pre-treatment samples, age- and sex-adjusted serum levels of both YKL-40 and IL-6 were significantly higher than in healthy persons at all ages (overall relative values: YKL-40: 3.6, 95% CI: 3.1?4.2, and IL-6: 8.3; 5.94?11.7; Figure 1 ). Relative serum levels of YKL-40 and IL-6 were not significantly different in 67 younger (<45 year old) vs. 129 older HL patients (p=0.86 and p=0.30, respectively) and the two groups were therefore combined for analysis. YKL-40 and IL-6 were moderately correlated (r=0.31; p<0.0001) with each other. After adjustment for age and sex, median serum levels of YKL-40 levels were 3.7-fold higher in patients with NS HL (95% CI: 3.1?4.5,) and 3.1-fold higher in patients with mixed cellularity (MC) HL (95% CI: 1.9?5.1), compared to the normal subjects. Similarly, serum IL-6 levels were increased 9.0-fold in NS HL (95% CI: 6.3?12.9) and 8.4-fold for MC HL (95% CI: 3.3?21.6). Other specified HL subtypes occurred too infrequently to allow robust comparisons. Patients with MC HL were older and more likely to be male than NS HL patients. After adjusting for the age and sex difference, serum YKL-40 and IL-6 levels did not differ significantly between NS and MC HL in pre-treatment samples (p=0-86 and p=0.37, respectively). Pre-treatment serum levels were higher in patients with more advanced disease stages (Ptrend YKL-40 = 0.0001 and IL-6 = 0.013; Table 2 ). Data about B symptoms were available only for Danish patients. Of 55 subjects with pre-treatment samples and data, 18 (33%) had B symptoms. Relative serum YKL-40 levels were higher in patients with B symptoms (1.8; 95% CI: 1.3?2.3) than those without B symptoms. IL-6 levels were also higher in patients with B symptoms than those without B symptoms, although the difference was not statistically significant (1.3; 95% CI: 0.5?3.0). The 38 patients with Epstein-Barr virus-positive tumors had marginally lower serum YKL-40 levels (median relative level: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.6?1.0) but marginally higher serum IL-6 levels (1.3; 95% CI: 0.7?2.2) than 125 patients with EBV-negative tumors, after adjustment for age and sex. In 196 samples obtained after treatment onset, serum levels of YKL-40 and IL-6 were also modestly correlated (r=0.27; p=0.001). The timing of the sample collection varied among the 196 patients with serum obtained after therapy had started. Serum levels of YKL-40 were lower in treated patients, even when the treatment had only been recently started, being 61%, 56%, and 70% of the pre-treatment levels at 0?2 (N=98), 3?5 (N=21) and ?6 months (N=29) after therapy onset, respectively. Correspondingly, IL-6 levels were 66%, 42%, and 47% of pre-treatment levels at 0?2, 3?5 and ?6 months, respectively ( Table 2 ). Overall, serum levels ?6 months after treatment onset were lower than in pre-treatment samples (p=0.007 for YKL-40 and p<0.01 for IL-6), but they remained 2.5 - fold (95% CI: 1.8?3.5, p<0.0001) higher for YKL-40 and 2.2-fold (95% CI: 1.0?5.1, p=0.06) higher for IL-6 than levels in healthy subjects. Twelve HL patients with pre-treatment samples had died by the end of follow-up in 2005, including 11 with NS HL. Although both serum YKL-40 and IL-6 levels were higher in NS HL patients who died than survivors with NS HL, the differences were not statistically significant. The hazard ratios for death were 1.58 (95% CI: 0.75?3.33) for serum YKL-40 and 1.12 (0.75?1.66) for serum IL-6, per log unit change. Twelve additional subjects with samples collected after treatment onset died, and, in them, serum levels of YKL-40 and IL-6, while higher than in survivors, were also not statistically significant predictors of prognosis.  Results Levels in healthy individuals (N=245 for YKL-40, N=348 for IL-6) are presented in Figure 1 . We used serum levels estimated in 35-year-old women as the reference value for statistical comparisons, 35 years being the median age of the HL cases.

After adjusting for the age and sex difference, serum YKL-40 and IL-6 levels did not differ significantly between NS and MC HL in pre-treatment samples (p=0-86 and p=0.37, respectively). Pre-treatment serum levels were higher in patients with more advanced disease stages (Ptrend YKL-40 = 0.0001 and IL-6 = 0.013; Table 2 ). Data about B symptoms were available only for Danish patients. Of 55 subjects with pre-treatment samples and data, 18 (33%) had B symptoms. Relative serum YKL-40 levels were higher in patients with B symptoms (1.8; 95% CI: 1.3?2.3) than those without B symptoms.

Correspondingly, IL-6 levels were 66%, 42%, and 47% of pre-treatment levels at 0?2, 3?5 and ?6 months, respectively ( Table 2 ). Overall, serum levels ?6 months after treatment onset were lower than in pre-treatment samples (p=0.007 for YKL-40 and p<0.01 for IL-6), but they remained 2.5 - fold (95% CI: 1.8?3.5, p<0.0001) higher for YKL-40 and 2.2-fold (95% CI: 1.0?5.1, p=0.06) higher for IL-6 than levels in healthy subjects. Twelve HL patients with pre-treatment samples had died by the end of follow-up in 2005, including 11 with NS HL. Although both serum YKL-40 and IL-6 levels were higher in NS HL patients who died than survivors with NS HL, the differences were not statistically significant. The hazard ratios for death were 1.58 (95% CI: 0.75?3.33) for serum YKL-40 and 1.12 (0.75?1.66) for serum IL-6, per log unit change. Twelve additional subjects with samples collected after treatment onset died, and, in them, serum levels of YKL-40 and IL-6, while higher than in survivors, were also not statistically significant predictors of prognosis.  Discussion Compared to healthy subjects, serum levels of YKL-40 and IL-6 were high in pre-treatment samples of patients with both NS and MC HL. In patients with HL, pre-treatment serum levels of YKL-40 and IL-6 were correlated directly with both disease stage and presence of B symptoms (YKL-40 only) but similarly increased in patients who were younger (<45 years) versus older at onset, had NS and MC HL subtypes, or by tumor EBV status. In treated patients, serum YKL-40 and IL-6 levels were significantly lower than in pre-treatment patients, but both levels still remained significantly higher than in healthy controls, even ?6 months after therapy onset. Although levels were not significantly correlated with prognosis, we had limited power to evaluate prognosis since few people died during the follow-up period of this study. The pathology and clinical symptoms of HL involve a complex interplay of chemokines and cytokines derived from both the HRS cells and the surrounding reactive cells 1 . This reactivity appears to involve the immune system 2 , 3 . Only a small percentage of the tumor mass in HL is composed of neoplastic cells, and the majority of the mass is created by the immunologic reaction surrounding the tumor cells 2 . The higher serum levels of YKL-40 might be mediated by tumor cells expressing IL-6 (known to be produced excessively by HRS and the surrounding reactive cells 1 , 8 - 10 ), by the immunologic reaction induced by these cells 2 , 13 , or by tissue destruction and remodeling related to the tumor mass. A reasonably intact immune system appears to be essential for the manifestation of the sclerosing reaction characteristic of NS HL, since it is not seen in persons who are profoundly immunosuppressed 3 . In contrast, patients with MC HL may have less immunological reaction to their tumors. Since YKL-40 and IL-6 levels were similar in NS and MC HL, after adjustment for age and sex, we speculate that the differences in the immune responses to HRS cells are not driving YKL-40 or IL-6 production. Rather, cytokine signals from the malignant cells or tissue damage from the tumor mass (including the immunologic reaction to it) may be more important triggers. However, IL-6 levels were found to be increased in the unaffected identical twin mates of persons with HL, leading those authors to suggest that IL-6 response may be a marker of susceptibility to HL 10 . Compared to pre-treatment samples, average serum levels of YKL-40 and especially IL-6 were lower in patients whose samples were obtained within weeks after therapy onset, possibly reflecting a rapid response to therapy. However, even ?6 months after therapy onset, serum levels of YKL-40 and IL-6 both remained higher than in healthy persons. In treated patients, most samples would have been collected while they were still on therapy, and thus the declines may have been due either to clearing of tumor tissue or to therapy itself, such as by its effect on immunocytes or other cells. Consistent with studies in other cancer types 4 , 5 , 7 , serum YKL-40 and IL-6 levels in pre-treatment samples correlated with disease burden, as measured by stage, and were higher in individuals who later died than in survivors. However, few of these patients died during follow-up, and we cannot be confident about the relationship between level and survival. In addition, we were not able to identify whether deaths were related to therapy, disease progression or other reasons. In summary, we found that serum levels of YKL-40 and IL-6 are higher in pre-treatment HL cases than healthy controls and in patients with more advanced stages of HL, but they were similar in NS and MC HL. Further work will be needed to determine whether these proteins act as direct mediators or surrogate markers of the disease process in HL.
