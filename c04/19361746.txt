Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients with relapsed chemorefractory aggressive non-hodgkin lymphomas Patients with chemorefractory aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) generally have poor clinical outcomes with available therapies. Allogeneic transplantation may be curative, but few studies are available to guide transplant decision making in this setting. We examined allogeneic transplantation outcomes for 46 patients with chemorefractory, aggressive NHL patients who had either stable disease (SD, n=32) or progressive disease (PD, n=14), respectively, following last salvage treatment. The median age was 46 years (range 22–63 yrs). 39 patients received matched sibling allografts, while 7 underwent unrelated donor transplantation. Diagnoses included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=18), Burkitt’s lymphoma (n=3), transformed B-cell lymphoma (n=5), mantle cell lymphoma (n=11) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (n=9). The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range 2–8). Median follow-up of surviving patients is 5-years. 5-year overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and relapse rate for the whole cohort (n=46) were 38%, 34%, and 35% respectively. The rate of grade II–IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 43%. Of the 33 evaluable patients 75% developed chronic GVHD. Overall non-relapse mortality rate was 34%. The 5-year OS and PFS rates for patients with SD and PD were 46% vs. 21% (p-value=0.01; log-rank test), and 46% vs. 7% (p-value=0.0002; log-rank test) respectively. This study confirms that allogeneic transplant is curative for a subset of chemorefractory patients with SD. However, patients with PD had uniformly poor outcomes following allografting with conventional conditioning approaches. Given the outcomes seen here in the setting of PD, such patients should proceed with transplant only in the setting of investigational therapy.  Patient characteristics 108 patients with aggressive NHL underwent allogeneic HSCT between 1988 and 2007 at our institution. Forty-six patients with chemorefractory disease following salvage chemotherapy, undergoing allogeneic transplantation between 1994 and 2007 met the inclusion criteria of this study. The median age was 46 years (range 22–63 yrs). Median Karnofsky performance status at the time of transplantation was 90 (range 60–100). 39 patients received matched sibling allografts, while 7 underwent unrelated donor SCT. All except 3 patients received myeloablative conditioning. Histological diagnosis (confirmed by review at Ohio State University) included DLBCL (n=18), BL (n=3), transformed B-cell lymphoma (n=5), MCL (n=11) and PTCL (n=9). The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range 2–8). No patient previously underwent autologous HSCT. At the time of transplantation 41 (89%) patients had advanced stage (Ann Arbor stage III/IV) disease, 23 (50%) patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 36 (78%) had extranodal involvement, while 14 (30%) patients had bulky disease (lymph nodes > 5cm). Among the patients with bulky disease 8 had SD, while 6 had PD (p-value = 0.22) before allografting. Four patients (9%) had central nervous system (leptomeningeal), and 29 (63%) had bone marrow involvement at the time of transplantation. None of the patients were positive for human immunodeficiency virus or human T-lymphotropic virus.  Response to salvage therapy At the time of allogeneic HSCT, out of the 46 patients with chemorefractory disease following salvage chemotherapy, 32 patients had SD while 14 patients had PD according to standard criteria [ 20 ]. Table 1 compares the baseline characteristics of chemorefractory patients with SD or PD at the time of transplantation. Five patients had PD following salvage chemotherapy because of development of (histology confirmed) new lesions. Patients in the SD or PD groups were comparable in terms of patient age, disease stage, histologies, stem cell source, CD34 dose, T-cell dose, and GVHD prophylaxis regimen. Patients with SD were more heavily pre-treated (median number of therapies 4), compared to PD patients (median number of therapies 2), while a higher proportion of patients in PD had elevated LDH. 31% (n=10) of B-cell lymphoma patients in SD group and 21% (n=3) in PD group had not previously received rituximab with salvage chemotherapy (p-value=0.49). All patients with SD received myeloablative conditioning, while 3 patients with PD had reduced-intensity conditioning.  Transplantation outcomes Median follow-up of surviving patients following allogeneic HSCT is 5-years. Median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 14 days and 22 days respectively. Rate of grade II-IV GVHD was 43% (n=20) overall, and 35% (n=5) and 46% (n=15) in PD group and SD group (p-value = 0.48) respectively ( Table 2 ). Among the 33 evaluable patients rate of chronic GVHD was 75% overall. In patients with PD and SD rates of chronic GVHD were 52% (7 evaluable patients), and 80% (26 evaluable patients) respectively (p-value = 0.19). The cumulative incidence of NRM at 5-years in the SD group and PD group was 29% (n=10), and 43% (n=6) (p-value = 0.24; Gray’s test) respectively. The corresponding day 100 NRM rates were 9% and 43% respectively. In the PD group causes of death included; disease progression (n=5), pulmonary failure (n=2), acute GVHD (n=1), pulmonary aspergillosis with acute GVHD (n=1), sepsis (n=1) and veno-occlusive disease (VOD) (n=1). Causes of death among SD group were; disease progression (n=8), sepsis with (n=2) and without GVHD (n=3), pulmonary failure (n=1), GVHD (n=2), and VOD (n=2).  Response rates and Survival Following HSCT the rates of CR, PR, SD and PD in patients with PD at the time of transplantation were 21% (n=3), 7% (n=1), 36% (n=5), and 36% (n=5) respectively ( Table 2 ). The response rates in the SD group in similar order were 65% (n=23), 16% (n=3), 13% (n=4), and 6% (n=2). Overall response rate (CR+PR) was markedly superior in SD group compared to the PD group (81% vs. 28% respectively; p-value=0.0005). Immunosuppressive medications were withdrawn in two PD group patients at the time of disease progression. In the first patient with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (who initially entered CR after HSCT), tapering immunosuppression at the time of histologically proven relapse on day +310 produced a second CR lasting 7 months. In the second patient with angioimmunoblastic lymphoma discontinuation of immunosuppressive at the time of disease progression (day +120) did not induce any GVL effect. Another patient in the PD group received DLI at the time of disease relapse, which produced a CR lasting +11 months. DLI was given to two patients in the SD group. The first patient received DLI because of secondary graft failure, and remains disease free at last follow-up. The second patient was given DLI because of persistent disease after transplantation which produced a CR lasting 4 months. At last follow-up 3 patients in PD group are alive. Two patients are currently in remission (with no active chronic GVHD), while the third patient (on immunosuppression for extensive chronic GVHD) is currently undergoing chemotherapy after disease relapse. Interestingly all 3 surviving patients in the PD group received RIC at the time of transplantation. None of the patients undergoing myeloablative conditioning survived beyond 6 months post-HSCT. 14 SD group patients are currently alive and all have no evidence of disease. Four patients are currently on immunosuppressive medications for extensive chronic GVHD. Among the four patients with active leptomeningeal involvement before myeloablative transplantation, one patient is alive and in remission 9 years post transplantation, two patients died at 5 and 6 months post transplant because of disease progression, while the fourth patient died at 3 months post allografting, while in remission secondary to pulmonary aspergillosis. The 5-year actuarial overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and relapse rate for the whole cohort (n=46) was 38%, 34%, and 35% respectively. Cumulative incidence of disease relapse was higher in patients with PD compared to patients with SD (50% vs. 25%; p-value = 0.08). The 5-year OS and PFS rates for patients with SD and PD were 46% vs. 21% (p-value=0.01; log-rank test) ( Figure 1 ), and 46% vs. 7% (p-value=0.0002; log-rank test) ( Figure 2 ) respectively. 5-year OS for patients with DLBCL, PTCL, MCL, BL and transformed B-cell lymphoma was 38%, 33%, 18%, 33% and 100% respectively. 5-year PFS in similar order was 38%, 22%, 18%, 33% and 80%. The rate of NRM for patients with DLBCL, PTCL, MCL, BL and transformed B-cell lymphoma was 38%, 33%, 55%, 0%, and 0% respectively. Relapse rates for these patients in identical order were 24%, 44%, 27%, 66%, and 20%. Development of chronic GVHD was not associated with OS (p-value=0.7), PFS (p-value=0.5) or lower relapse rates (p-value=0.6). In order to address the patient selection bias inherently associated with evolving transplantation practices over time and the general advances in supportive care, outcomes of patients transplanted between 1994–2000 (Group-O; n=20) were compared with those transplanted between 2001–2007 (Group-N; n=26). The 5-year OS for patients in Group-O and Group-N was 40% and 38% (p-value=0.99) respectively. 5-year PFS in similar order was 40% and 30% (p-value=0.70) respectively. On multivariate logistic regression analysis PD at the time of transplantation was the only variable predicting for inferior PFS (p-value=0.03), but not inferior OS (p-value=0.19).  Patients and Methods Patient population Patients with a history of histologically confirmed aggressive NHL undergoing allogeneic HSCT were identified from a prospectively maintained database of all patients undergoing HSCT at Ohio State University. Acceptable histologies included DLBCL, Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL), transformed B-cell lymphoma, PTCL, and MCL [ 17 – 19 ]. Patients with a diagnosis of indolent lymphoma and those with lymphoblastic lymphoma were not included in this study. Patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation with an untreated relapse (i.e. patients not receiving salvage chemotherapy before transplant) were also excluded. For aggressive NHL patients receiving salvage chemotherapy before transplantation, response to salvage therapy was assessed according to standard criteria [ 20 ]. Patients achieving partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to salvage chemotherapy were considered to have chemosensitive disease and were excluded from this analysis. Those patients with an available normal gallium or PET (positron emission tomography)-scan before transplantation (regardless of the presence or absence of residual radiographic abnormalities on CT-scans) were also excluded. Aggressive NHL patients who had chemorefractory disease [i.e. patients with stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD)] as specified by Cheson et al. criteria [ 20 ] following salvage chemotherapy, constitute the subject of this study. Transplantation procedure and supportive care All patients were treated in HEPA-filtered inpatient bone marrow transplantation unit, and received fungal, herpes zoster, bacterial and Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis. Patients and their donors were tested for HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C by at least standard serologic typing and for HLA-DRB1 by high-resolution techniques. Unmanipulated hematopoietic stem cells (mobilized from peripheral blood or harvested from non-stimulated marrow) were infused through a central venous catheter on day zero. Allogeneic HSCT recipients were monitored weekly for cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation with hybrid capture assay. Ganciclovir or foscarnet were used at the discretion of treating physician for patients with evidence of CMV reactivation. All patients received irradiated and leukoreduced blood products. CMV negative products were used for CMV seronegative patients. Neutrophil engraftment was defined as first of 3 successive days with ANC ? 0.5 × 109/L after post-transplantation nadir. Platelet engraftment was considered to have occurred on the first of three consecutive days with platelet count 20 × 109/L or higher, in the absence of platelet transfusion. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was graded using standard criteria [ 21 ]. Patients achieving neutrophil engraftment were evaluable for acute GVHD, while patients surviving at least 100 days post-transplantation were evaluable for chronic GVHD. Post-HSCT monitoring Patients underwent restaging bone marrow aspiration and biopsy (if abnormal before transplantation) and computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis on day +60 (or earlier if clinically indicated) after HSCT. Imaging studies were repeated at 3 monthly intervals for first three years and annually thereafter through 5 years after HSCT. All post-transplant radiographic studies were retrospectively reviewed and responses assessed according to standard criteria [ 20 ]. In the ambulatory setting (post-allografting) patients were followed at least weekly until day +90, then every 4–6 weeks up to day +180, followed by outpatient visits at least every 12 weeks till three years post-transplantation. Relapse or disease progression was histologically confirmed (when possible). Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were not routinely performed in patients with persistent disease or relapse post-transplantation. Data collection and statistical analysis Data were collected using retrospective chart and database review. All available pathological, radiological and autopsy reports were reviewed. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. OS was defined as the time from transplant to death from any cause, and surviving patients were censored at last follow-up. PFS from transplantation was calculated using death and disease progression and/or relapse as events. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was defined as death from any cause other than disease progression or relapse. Cumulative incidence was estimated for NRM and relapse risk, with relapse as a competing risk for the former and death in remission for the latter. Gary’s test was used to assess the difference between various subgroups for NRM and relapse rate. All calculations were performed using the SPSS 13.0 statistical package (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL), except competing risk analysis for the cumulative incidence of NRM and relapse risk, which was performed by using R-Project (version 2.8.0; http://www.r-project.org/ ). All p-values are two sided.

The response rates in the SD group in similar order were 65% (n=23), 16% (n=3), 13% (n=4), and 6% (n=2). Overall response rate (CR+PR) was markedly superior in SD group compared to the PD group (81% vs. 28% respectively; p-value=0.0005). Immunosuppressive medications were withdrawn in two PD group patients at the time of disease progression. In the first patient with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (who initially entered CR after HSCT), tapering immunosuppression at the time of histologically proven relapse on day +310 produced a second CR lasting 7 months. In the second patient with angioimmunoblastic lymphoma discontinuation of immunosuppressive at the time of disease progression (day +120) did not induce any GVL effect. Another patient in the PD group received DLI at the time of disease relapse, which produced a CR lasting +11 months. DLI was given to two patients in the SD group. The first patient received DLI because of secondary graft failure, and remains disease free at last follow-up. The second patient was given DLI because of persistent disease after transplantation which produced a CR lasting 4 months. At last follow-up 3 patients in PD group are alive. Two patients are currently in remission (with no active chronic GVHD), while the third patient (on immunosuppression for extensive chronic GVHD) is currently undergoing chemotherapy after disease relapse. Interestingly all 3 surviving patients in the PD group received RIC at the time of transplantation. None of the patients undergoing myeloablative conditioning survived beyond 6 months post-HSCT. 14 SD group patients are currently alive and all have no evidence of disease. Four patients are currently on immunosuppressive medications for extensive chronic GVHD. Among the four patients with active leptomeningeal involvement before myeloablative transplantation, one patient is alive and in remission 9 years post transplantation, two patients died at 5 and 6 months post transplant because of disease progression, while the fourth patient died at 3 months post allografting, while in remission secondary to pulmonary aspergillosis. The 5-year actuarial overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and relapse rate for the whole cohort (n=46) was 38%, 34%, and 35% respectively. Cumulative incidence of disease relapse was higher in patients with PD compared to patients with SD (50% vs. 25%; p-value = 0.08). The 5-year OS and PFS rates for patients with SD and PD were 46% vs. 21% (p-value=0.01; log-rank test) ( Figure 1 ), and 46% vs. 7% (p-value=0.0002; log-rank test) ( Figure 2 ) respectively. 5-year OS for patients with DLBCL, PTCL, MCL, BL and transformed B-cell lymphoma was 38%, 33%, 18%, 33% and 100% respectively. 5-year PFS in similar order was 38%, 22%, 18%, 33% and 80%. The rate of NRM for patients with DLBCL, PTCL, MCL, BL and transformed B-cell lymphoma was 38%, 33%, 55%, 0%, and 0% respectively. Relapse rates for these patients in identical order were 24%, 44%, 27%, 66%, and 20%. Development of chronic GVHD was not associated with OS (p-value=0.7), PFS (p-value=0.5) or lower relapse rates (p-value=0.6). In order to address the patient selection bias inherently associated with evolving transplantation practices over time and the general advances in supportive care, outcomes of patients transplanted between 1994–2000 (Group-O; n=20) were compared with those transplanted between 2001–2007 (Group-N; n=26). The 5-year OS for patients in Group-O and Group-N was 40% and 38% (p-value=0.99) respectively. 5-year PFS in similar order was 40% and 30% (p-value=0.70) respectively. On multivariate logistic regression analysis PD at the time of transplantation was the only variable predicting for inferior PFS (p-value=0.03), but not inferior OS (p-value=0.19).  Discussion Allogeneic HSCT remains the sole curative modality for high-risk relapsed aggressive NHL patients [ 11 – 16 ]. Studies focusing solely on the outcomes of patients with chemorefractory disease at the time of transplantation have not been previously reported. We report here 5-year OS and PFS rates of 38% and 34% respectively for patients with chemorefractory aggressive lymphomas. This study highlights the heterogeneity in transplant outcomes for chemorefractory aggressive NHL patients. The group of patients with SD following salvage chemotherapy in our study had encouraging 5-year OS and PFS rates of 46% each. These results are quite encouraging, especially in the context of the dismal outcomes of these high-risk patients with standard chemotherapy or autologous HSCT. Caution however needs to be exercised while interpreting these results, as patient selection certainly is partly responsible for these favorable outcomes, since even these poor prognosis chemorefractory patients with SD, were judged young and healthy enough to undergo myeloablative allogeneic HSCT. Nonetheless survival rates of SD group in this study are comparable to previous studies reporting allogeneic transplantation outcomes of relapsed aggressive NHL (with similar inherent selection biases) [ 12 – 15 ]. Doocey et al. reported 5-year OS of 48% in a cohort of 44 aggressive NHL patients (including 9 with chemorefractory disease) [ 13 ]. Similarly French [ 14 ] and Japanese [ 12 ] registry data have reported OS rates of 41% and 42% respectively with allografting in aggressive NHL. Although these studies included patients with refractory disease, their outcomes were not reported separately. Interestingly in Doocey et al’s [ 13 ], the relapse rate in patients with refractory disease was not significantly different from patients with chemosensitive disease. Inferior OS for chemorefractory patients was seen in Italian registry data, but that study included a substantial proportion of patients with indolent histologies and Hodgkins disease [ 9 ]. Majority of the patients in previously reported studies of allogeneic transplantation for aggressive NHL received total body irradiation (TBI) based conditioning regimens. In contrast, none of the patients in this study received TBI, which suggests that non-TBI based conditioning regimens at least produces outcomes comparable to TBI conditioning in aggressive NHL following allogeneic HSCT. Importantly this study identifies a cohort of chemorefractory patients with PD following salvage chemotherapy, which despite receiving mostly myeloablative transplantation had dismal 5-year OS and PFS of 21% and 7% respectively. Patients exhibiting disease progression despite combination salvage chemotherapy clearly represent a group with extremely poor prognosis, who are unlikely to benefit from allografting and should be spared the toxicities of donor transplantation. At the same time chemorefractory patients with SD perhaps have a less aggressive disease biology, and if transplant eligible, they appear to have at least a reasonable chance of long term survival with allogeneic transplantation. This is noteworthy because these SD patients have a uniformly poor outcome if they undergo high-dose therapy and autologous transplantation. Such divergent outcomes indicate that the encouraging results of chemorefractory patients in our study are likely a result of immune-mediated lymphoma eradication, and are not simply due to the intensity of conditioning chemotherapy administered. Since functional imaging (PET-scanning) or biopsies to confirm active lymphoma were not routinely performed in all the patients with SD in this study, it is possible that these favorable outcomes are due to a chance inclusion of large proportion of patients with residual radiographic abnormalities merely representing “non-viable lymphoma”. However survival outcomes of 14 patients in SD group who had either a positive PET-scan or histology confirmed viable lymphoma at the time of transplantation were comparable to entire group overall (5-year OS of 45%, compared to 46% in patients without such evidence). The overall NRM rate of 34% in this study for high-risk patients predominantly undergoing myeloablative allogeneic is comparable to previous studies of myeloablative allogeneic transplantation in aggressive NHL, where NRM rates have ranged from 20–45% [ 12 , 15 , 22 , 23 ]. In the modern era of transplantation NRM rates over 30% even following ablative conditioning are unacceptably high. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) transplantation is an attractive modality which has shown impressively low NRM rates without compromising efficacy in the indolent lymphomas [ 10 , 24 ]. However for patients with relapsed aggressive lymphomas, NRM rates with RIC allogeneic transplantation, with a few exceptions [ 9 , 25 ] have been surprisingly high (range 25–38%) [ 26 – 28 ]. For patients with chemosensitive disease overall survival rates have been encouraging (45–80%) [ 25 , 28 , 29 ]. Information about outcomes of chemorefractory patients following RIC is limited, but at least two studies suggest significantly inferior outcomes of such patients compared to those with chemosensitive relapse [ 26 , 29 ]. Prospective trials comparing myeloablative conditioning with RIC in the setting of chemorefractory aggressive NHL are unlikely to be performed, and the choice of conditioning regimen will continue to largely depend on patient age, performance status, disease bulk and physician preference. In conclusion a subgroup of chemorefractory patients with stable disease by standard radiograph criteria following salvage chemotherapy can experience favorable outcomes following allogeneic transplantation and should not be excluded solely based on the lack of evidence of chemosensitive disease. Patients with PD have a dismal prognosis despite allogeneic transplantation, should not be considered for allogeneic transplantation except in the setting of a clinical trial.
