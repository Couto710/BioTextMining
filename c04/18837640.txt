Addiction to Prescription Opioids: Characteristics of the Emerging Epidemic and Treatment with Buprenorphine Dependence on and abuse of prescription opioid drugs is now a major health problem, with initiation of prescription opioid abuse exceeding cocaine in young people. Coincident with the emergence of abuse and dependence on prescription opioids, there has been an increased emphasis on the treatment of pain. Pain is now the “5th vital sign” and physicians face disciplinary action for failure to adequately relieve pain. Thus, physicians are whipsawed between the imperative to treat pain with opioids and the fear of producing addiction in some patients. In this article we characterize the emerging epidemic of prescription opioid abuse, discuss the utility of buprenorphine in the treatment of addiction to prescription opioids, and present illustrative case histories of successful treatment with buprenorphine.  Conclusions Prescription opioids remain safe and effective pharmacotherapies for surgical, traumatic, and malignant pain, and although controversial, are widely prescribed for chronic non-malignant pain. However, over the last decade marked increase in abuse of and addiction to prescription opioids has occurred. Opioid prescribing by physicians for pain has increased in medical offices and emergency rooms, and some of these appropriately treated patients develop addiction. Fortunately, for those who do develop addiction, opioid substitution with buprenorphine and medical management of iatrogenic addiction in office settings appears safe and efficacious. Although the treatment of pain is better than the disease, the ethical imperatives of pain relief and therapeutic beneficence mandate development of analgesics with lower abuse liability, better methods to detect patients at risk for developing addiction, and improved treatments for patients who become addicted.
