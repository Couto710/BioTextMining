Even Cancers Want Commitment: Lineage Identity and Medulloblastoma Formation In this issue of Cancer Cell , Yang et al. (2008) and Sch√ºller et al. (2008) show that Hedgehog activation in either multipotent neural stem cells or developmentally restricted progenitors causes only medulloblastomas to form. These data suggest that some stem cell-derived tumors must commit to a specific lineage in order to grow.
