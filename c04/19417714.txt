Findings From The Vision In Preschoolers (VIP) Study The Vision in Preschoolers (VIP) Study Group conducted a multi-center, multi-disciplinary, two phase study to evaluate the performance of vision screening tests for identifying preschool children with amblyopia, strabismus, significant refractive error, or unexplained reduced visual acuity (VA). The results of the Vision in Preschoolers (VIP) Study provide evidence-based guidelines for preschool vision screening. The best screening tests administered by eye care professionals were noncycloplegic retinoscopy, Retinomax Autorefractor, SureSight Vision Screener, and linear, crowded Lea Symbols® visual acuity (VA) at 10 feet. The best screening tests administered by trained nurses and/or lay screeners were Retinomax, SureSight, and VIP single, crowded Lea Symbols® VA screening test system at 5 feet. Eye care professionals can improve detection of strabismus by combining unilateral cover test with a refraction test and trained lay screeners can improve detection of strabismus by combining Stereo Smile II with SureSight. The best performing tests had high testability whether performed by trained eye care professionals, nurses or lay screeners (?98%). Although very few children were unable to complete these tests, a child who was ‘unable’ was much more likely to have a vision problem than a child who passed; therefore children who are unable to complete one of these tests should be referred for further evaluation. When screening using the Retinomax, repeated testing to achieve the manufacturer's suggested confidence number is valuable and improves specificity. Federal initiatives to increase the number of preschool children receiving vision screening or examination will increase the number of preschool children identified with amblyopia, strabismus and/or significant refractive error. Although there is general agreement regarding the importance of early detection of amblyopia, controversy exists regarding the importance of early detection of refractive error. Because of the high prevalence of significant refractive errors and lack of evidenced-based guidelines for correction of refractive error in preschool children, future research is needed to evaluate the value of correcting refractive errors in preschoolers who do not have amblyopia and/or strabismus.  Future Research Federal initiatives are in progress to increase the number of preschool children receiving vision screening or examination. 17 , 18 Results from the VIP study provide important information to guide the development and implementation of more effective screening protocols. There is consensus that amblyopia is valuable to detect early, because it can lead to loss of vision unless detected and treated during childhood. 1 Because the best tests for detection of amblyopia or ? 1 targeted condition are also the best tests for detection of significant refractive error, increased vision screening will result in an increased number of preschool children identified as having significant refractive error. Although significant refractive error is often associated with amblyopia and strabismus 5 , 8 and is the most prevalent and easily corrected vision disorder, 1 , 19 consensus has not been reached on the value of detecting refractive errors in preschool children. 20 The decision of whether to prescribe refractive correction for preschool children who do not have amblyopia and/or strabismus (particularly for those with hyperopia) can be challenging because evidence-based guidelines are not available and most young children have some degree of hyperopia. In addition, children with vision problems generally do not complain because they do not understand their symptoms are abnormal and/or cannot communicate their symptoms. Studies have shown that hyperopia may interfere with learning and development, 21 - 27 which may indicate that correction may be of value. Because of the high prevalence of significant refractive errors in preschool children, future research is needed to determine whether correction of refractive errors is beneficial in preschoolers who do not have amblyopia and/or strabismus.
