Stimulation of the wrist acupuncture point P6 for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting Background Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are common complications following surgery and anaesthesia. Drugs to prevent PONV are only partially effective. An alternative approach is to stimulate the P6 acupoint on the wrist. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of P6 acupoint stimulation in preventing PONV. Search strategy We searched CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library , Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2008), EMBASE (January 1988 to September 2008), ISI Web of Science (January 1965 to September 2008), the National Library of Medicine publication list of acupuncture studies, and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria All randomized trials of techniques that stimulated the P6 acupoint compared with sham treatment or drug therapy for the prevention of PONV. Interventions used in these trials included acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, transcutaneous nerve stimulation, laser stimulation, capsicum plaster, an acu-stimulation device, and acupressure in patients undergoing surgery. Primary outcomes were the risks of nausea and vomiting. Secondary outcomes were the need for rescue antiemetic therapy and adverse effects. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the data. We collected adverse effect information from the trials. We used a random-effects model and reported relative risk (RR) with associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Main results We included 40 trials involving 4858 participants; four trials reported adequate allocation concealment. Twelve trials did not report all outcomes. Compared with sham treatment P6 acupoint stimulation significantly reduced: nausea (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.83); vomiting (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.83), and the need for rescue antiemetics (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.83). Heterogeneity among trials was moderate. There was no clear difference in the effectiveness of P6 acupoint stimulation for adults and children; or for invasive and noninvasive acupoint stimulation. There was no evidence of difference between P6 acupoint stimulation and antiemetic drugs in the risk of nausea (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.13), vomiting (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.31), or the need for rescue antiemetics (RR 0.82, 95%CI 0.59 to 1.13). The side effects associated with P6 acupoint stimulation were minor. There was no evidence of publication bias from contour-enhanced funnel plots. Authors’ conclusions P6 acupoint stimulation prevented PONV. There was no reliable evidence for differences in risks of postoperative nausea or vomiting after P6 acupoint stimulation compared to antiemetic drugs.  METHODS Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of techniques intended to stimulate the P6 acupoint, compared with either sham treatment or antiemetic drugs, for the prevention of PONV. ’Sham treatment’ was defined as a device applied in a non-P6 location, or any attempt to imitate (give the illusion of) P6 acupoint stimulation. Therefore, for trials that assessed acupressure wristbands, wristbands without studs placed at the P6 acupoint were considered as adequate sham treatment and these trials were included in the review. Types of participants All surgical patients without age limitation. The age limits for children were defined by each study. Types of interventions Techniques intended to stimulate the P6 acupoint: acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, laser acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical stimulation, an acu-stimulation device, acupressure, and capsicum plaster; versus sham treatment or drug therapy for the prevention of PONV. These diverse techniques were considered as one entity in the main analysis, consistent with the concept that stimulating the correct acupuncture point is more important than the nature of the stimulus ( Mann 1987 ). There was no restriction on the duration of P6 acupoint stimulation or when it was applied. Types of outcome measures We did separate meta-analyses for each of the following primary and secondary outcomes. Trials could report more than one primary or secondary outcome. Primary outcomes Risk of postoperative nausea. Risks of postoperative vomiting. This was defined as either retching or vomiting, or both. Postoperative nausea and vomiting were not combined as we could not be certain that patients who vomited were also nauseated. If the authors reported several incidences of the outcome measure (for example 0 to 6 hours, 6 to 24 hours, 0 to 24 hours), the longest cumulative follow-up data from the end of surgery were used (in this case, 0 to 24 hours). Secondary outcomes Risk of patients requiring a rescue antiemetic drug. Risk of side effects. Search methods for identification of studies Electronic searches We searched the following for relevant trials. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library , Issue 3, 2008), in Appendix 1 . Electronic databases: MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2008), in Appendix 2 ; EMBASE (January 1988 to September 2008), in Appendix 3 ; ISI Web of Science (January 1965 to September 2008), in Appendix 4 ; and National Library of Medicine publication list of acupuncture studies ( http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/cbm/acupuncture.html ). Reference lists of relevant articles, reviews, and trials. We combined the following MeSH and text words with the filters for identifying randomized controlled trials: ’postoperative complications’, ’nausea and vomiting’, ’acupuncture’, ’acupuncture therapy’, ’acupuncture points’, ’acupressure’, ’transcutaneous electric nerve stimulator’, and ’electro-acupuncture’. There was no language restriction. We excluded studies of P6 acupoint stimulation to treat established PONV, or to prevent intraoperative nausea or vomiting. Searching other resources We did not search for conference proceedings or seek unpublished trials. Grey literature has not been peer-reviewed and there is some evidence that it is of lower quality than published studies ( McAuley 2000 ). Data collection and analysis We selected trials identified by our search that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. There was no disagreement between authors about inclusion and exclusion of studies for this review. We examined all selected trials for duplicate data; where we found duplication, we used the results of the main trial report. We extracted data independently, using a standardized data collection form, and we resolved any discrepancies in data extraction by discussion. We assessed the quality of the included trials independently, under open conditions. We graded the risk of bias for each study in the domains of sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, healthcare providers, and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and comparison of baseline characteristics for each group in a ’Risk of bias’ table ( Higgins 2008 ). We graded each domain as yes (low risk of bias), no (high risk of bias), or unclear (uncertain risk of bias) according to the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( Higgins 2008 ). We collected data on the type, duration, and timing of P6 acupoint stimulation, as well as the type and dose of prophylactic antiemetic drug. We recorded details of the patient population and type of surgery. We did not consider factors such as the severity of PONV or the number of episodes of vomiting. We used the random-effects model to combine data, as we expected that the treatments and conditions in these trials would be heterogeneous. This model incorporates both between-study (different treatment effects) and within-study (sampling error) variability ( Mosteller 1996 ). We calculated the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI), and analysed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic as a measure of the proportion of total variation in the estimates of treatment effect that is due to heterogeneity between studies. We conducted sensitivity analyses to estimate the robustness of results according to sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessor (adequate versus inadequate or unclear), selective reporting (adequate versus inadequate or unclear), and control event rate (? 20%, > 20%). We undertook exploratory a priori subgroup analyses, which included trials in adults versus trials in children and trials according to type of P6 acupoint stimulation (invasive versus noninvasive). To test whether the subgroups were different from one another, we tested the interaction using the technique outlined by Altman and Bland ( Altman 2003 ). We used the contour-enhanced funnel plot to differentiate asymmetry due to publication bias from that due to other factors ( Peters 2008 ), using STATA statistical software (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, version 10). Contour-enhanced funnel plots display the area of statistical significance on a funnel plot ( Peters 2008 ) to improve the correct identification of the presence or absence of publication bias. This was used in conjunction with the ’trim and fill’ method ( Duval 2000 ) to inform the likely location of missing studies, using STATA statistical software (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, version 10), as suggested by Peters ( Peters 2008 ). Publication bias would be expected when the usual funnel plot is asymmetrical but assessment of the contour-enhanced funnel plot indicates that missing studies are located where nonsignificant studies would be plotted ( Peters 2008 ). We estimated the number needed to treat (NNT) for different baseline risk for nausea and vomiting using the RR ( Smeeth 1999 ) to assess whether P6 acupoint stimulation is worthwhile for individuals. We estimated the 95% CI around the number needed to treat using the method outlined by Altman ( Altman 1998 ).

RESULTS Description of studies See: Characteristics of included studies ; Characteristics of excluded studies . The search identified 67 trials of P6 acupoint stimulation for PONV. The flow chart ( Figure 1 ) shows the results of the literature search (the number of hits) and the culling process to reduce the total to 40 included studies. Included studies We included 40 trials, involving 4858 participants, conducted between 1986 and 2008. All trials but one ( Gieron 1993 ) were published in English. Most trials recruited healthy adults undergoing elective surgery. Seven trials recruited children ( Butkovic 2005 ; Lewis 1991 ; Rusy 2002 ; Schlager 1998 ; Shenkman 1999 ; Wang 2002 ; Yentis 1992 ). One trial recruited both children and adults ( Amir 2007 ). Most participants had general anaesthesia. Women having elective Caesarean delivery received spinal anaesthesia in four studies ( Duggal 1998 ; Habib 2006 ; Harmon 2000 ; Ho 1996 ). There were 10 types of P6 acupoint stimulation: needle acupuncture ( Dundee 1986 ; Dundee 1989 ; Sharma 2007 ; Streitberger 2004 ; Yentis 1992 ); infiltration of dextrose ( Tavlan 1996 ; Wang 2002 ; Yang 1993 ); semipermanent needles ( Andrzejowski 1996 ); electrical stimulation of needles ( Amir 2007 ; Dundee 1989 ; Ho 1989 ; Rusy 2002 ); transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( Fassoulaki 1993 ; Gan 2004 ; Habib 2006 ; Ho 1989 ); laser stimulation ( Butkovic 2005 ; Schlager 1998 ); an acu-stimulation device ( White 2002 ; Zarate 2001 ); and acupressure ( Agarwal 2000 ; Agarwal 2002 ; Alkaissi 1999 ; Alkaissi 2002 ; Allen 1994 ; Barsoum 1990 ; Duggal 1998 ; Ferrara-Love 1996 ; Gieron 1993 ; Harmon 1999 ; Harmon 2000 ; Ho 1996 ; Klein 2004 ; Lewis 1991 ; Samad 2003 ; Schultz 2003 ; Turgut 2007 ). Two studies used conventional peripheral nerve stimulation ( Arnberger 2007 ; Liu 2008 ). One trial each used: both acupressure and acupuncture ( Shenkman 1999 ); and a capsicum plaster ( Misra 2005 ). The type of surgery; type, timing, and duration of stimulation of the P6 acupoint; and the follow-up time for assessing PONV varied greatly. P6 stimulation was compared with five antiemetic drugs: metoclopramide ( Butkovic 2005 ; Dundee 1989 ); cyclizine ( Dundee 1989 ); prochlorperazine ( Barsoum 1990 ; Ho 1989 ); droperidol ( Schultz 2003 ; Wang 2002 ; Yang 1993 ; Yentis 1992 ); and ondansetron ( Agarwal 2002 ; Gan 2004 ; Misra 2005 ; Sharma 2007 ; Tavlan 1996 ; White 2002 ). Excluded studies We excluded 27 trials. Please see ’ Characteristics of excluded studies ’ for more information. Risk of bias in included studies Allocation sequence was generated using a computer-generated random numbers table ( Agarwal 2000 ; Arnberger 2007 ; Gan 2004 ; Harmon 1999 ; Ho 1996 ; Klein 2004 ; Misra 2005 ; White 2002 ; Zarate 2001 ), a table of random numbers ( Agarwal 2002 ; Duggal 1998 ; Liu 2008 ; Samad 2003 ; Schultz 2003 ), a block design procedure ( Rusy 2002 ), and a yoking randomization based on a computer-generated list ( Wang 2002 ). Four of the 40 trials reported adequate allocation concealment ( Arnberger 2007 ; Gan 2004 ; Schultz 2003 ; Streitberger 2004 ). In 34 trials the allocation concealment was unclear, and in one trial ( Ferrara-Love 1996 ) it was inadequate. Patients were not blinded in one study ( Sharma 2007 ) because acupuncture needles inserted before induction of anaesthesia had to be kept in situ in the operating room in two of the three intervention groups. There was no blinding of healthcare providers in two studies ( Arnberger 2007 ; Sharma 2007 ). The outcome assessor was not blinded in two studies ( Gieron 1993 ; Sharma 2007 ). Twelve trials did not report all four outcomes: postoperative nausea, postoperative vomiting, rescue antiemetic drugs, and adverse events in their studies ( Alkaissi 1999 ; Allen 1994 ; Barsoum 1990 ; Butkovic 2005 ; Fassoulaki 1993 ; Ferrara-Love 1996 ; Habib 2006 ; Harmon 2000 ; Ho 1989 ; Lewis 1991 ; Schultz 2003 ; Yang 1993 ). All studies except one ( Dundee 1989 ) reported the between-group comparisons of baseline characteristics. A ’Risk of bias’ graph captures the review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item, presented as percentages across all included trials ( Figure 2 ). A ’Risk of bias’ summary captures the review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item for each included trial ( Figure 3 ). There was one study with a low risk of bias ( Gan 2004 ), as all key domains were rated ’Yes’. Of the 16 studies with a high risk of bias (one or more key domains were rated ’No’), 12 of these were due to selective reporting. The risk of bias in the remaining 23 studies was unclear. Effects of interventions See: Summary of findings for the main comparison; Summary of findings 2 P6 acupoint stimulation versus sham treatment Nausea (see Analysis 1.1) Twenty-seven trials examined P6 acupoint stimulation for the prevention of nausea, in a total of 2962 participants (Analysis 1.1). P6 acupoint stimulation reduced the risk of nausea (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.83) but there was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 60%) ( Figure 4 ). The ’trim and fill’ method did not trim or add any more studies to the contour-enhanced funnel plot ( Figure 5 ). The estimated number needed to treat for different baseline risks of nausea is shown in ’Additional Table 1 ’. There was no evidence of an interaction between the estimated effect of P6 stimulation and the sensitivity and subgroup analyses that were prespecified: adequate compared with unclear or inadequate sequence generation (Analyses 1.1.2, 1.1.3: z statistic ?0.79, P = 0.43); allocation concealment (Analyses 1.1.4, 1.1.5: z statistic 0.32, P = 0.75); blinding of outcome assessor (Analyses 1.1.6, 1.1.7: z statistic ?1.64, P = 0.10); selective reporting (Analyses 1.1.8, 1.1.9: z statistic ?0.72, P = 0.47); control event rates ? 20% or more than 20% (Analyses 1.1.10, 1.1.11: z statistic 0.70, P = 0.48); children compared with adults (Analyses 1.1.12, 1.1.13: z statistic ?1.13, P = 0.26); invasive compared with noninvasive P6 acupoint stimulation (Analyses 1.1.14, 1.1.15: z statistic ?0.63, P = 0.53). Vomiting (see Analysis 1.2) Thirty-two trials examined P6 acupoint stimulation for the prevention of vomiting, in 3385 participants. P6 acupoint stimulation reduced the risk of vomiting (RR 0.70, 95%CI 0.59 to 0.83) but there was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 53%) ( Figure 6 ). The ’trim and fill’ method did not trim or add any more studies to the contour-enhanced funnel plot ( Figure 7 ). The estimated number needed to treat for different baseline risks of vomiting is shown in ’Additional Table 1 ’. There was no evidence of an interaction between the estimated effect of P6 stimulation and the prespecified sensitivity and subgroup analyses: adequate compared with unclear or inadequate sequence generation (Analyses 1.1.2, 1.1.3: z statistic 0.42, P = 0.68); allocation concealment (Analyses 1.1.4, 1.1.5: z statistic 0.25, P = 0.80); blinding of outcome assessor (Analyses 1.1.6, 1.1.7: z statistic 0, P = 1.00); selective reporting (Analyses 1.1.8, 1.1.9: z statistic 0.24, P = 0.81); control event rates ? 20% or more than 20% (Analyses 1.1.10, 1.1.11: z statistic 1.10, P = 0.27); children compared with adults (Analyses 1.1.12, 1.1.13: z statistic ?0.41, P = 0.68); invasive compared with noninvasive P6 acupoint stimulation (Analyses 1.1.14, 1.1.15, z statistic ?0.85, P = 0.40). Rescue antiemetic (Analysis 1.3) The risk that a rescue antiemetic was required was less after P6 stimulation than after sham treatment (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.83) ( Figure 8 ). There was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 43%). Three trials did not specify the type of rescue antiemetic drug used ( Alkaissi 2002 ; Duggal 1998 ; Ferrara-Love 1996 ). We included the data excluded by one trial for persistent vomiting ( Fassoulaki 1993 ). Side effects Overall, the side effects associated with P6 acupoint stimulation were minor and self-limiting. No side effects were observed for patients receiving acupuncture ( Dundee 1986 ; Dundee 1989 ; Sharma 2007 ); acupressure, in several trials ( Agarwal 2000 ; Agarwal 2002 ; Gieron 1993 ; Harmon 1999 ; Ho 1996 ; Klein 2004 ; Lewis 1991 ); or transcutaneous electro-acupoint stimulation by a peripheral nerve stimulator ( Liu 2008 ). Haematomas occurred in one patient in the acupuncture group and in two patients in the placebo acupuncture group ( Streitberger 2004 ). Although no side effects were reported in associated with an acu-stimulation device ( White 2002 ), another trial reported mild cutaneous irritation ( Zarate 2001 ). Pain was reported at the acupuncture site in one trial ( Yang 1993 ). There was no significant difference in the incidence of redness and irritation at the puncture site between P6 acupoint stimulation and sham treatment groups ( Shenkman 1999 ). Patients complained of feeling tired and sleepy during electro-acupuncture stimulation ( Ho 1989 ). Two trials ( Alkaissi 2002 ; Duggal 1998 ) reported that acupressure bands felt uncomfortable; produced red indentation; or caused itching, headache and dizziness, swollen wrists, and blistering at the site of the button. One patient complained of mild irritation at the site of capsicum plaster application ( Misra 2005 ). P6 acupoint stimulation versus antiemetic drug Nausea (Analysis 2.1) There was no difference in the risk of postoperative nausea for P6 acupoint stimulation compared to pooled antiemetic drugs (Analysis 2.1.6: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.13) ( Agarwal 2002 ; Dundee 1989 ; Gan 2004 ; Misra 2005 ; Schultz 2003 ; Sharma 2007 ; Tavlan 1996 ; Wang 2002 ; White 2002 ). There was minor heterogeneity between the trials (I2 = 37%) ( Figure 9 ). The ’trim and fill’ method did not trim or add any more studies to the contour-enhanced funnel plot ( Figure 10 ). The level of sequence generation modified the estimated effect of P6 stimulation on nausea (Analyses 2.1.7, 2.1.8: z statistic 2.02, P = 0.04). There was no evidence of any interaction between the estimated effect of P6 stimulation and the prespecified sensitivity and subgroup analyses: allocation concealment (Analyses 2.1.9, 2.1.10: z statistic 0.27, P = 0.79); blinding of outcome assessor (Analyses 2.1.11, 2.1.12: z statistic ?1.03, P = 0.30); selective reporting (Analyses 2.1.13, 2.1.14: z statistic 0.15, P = 0.88). Vomiting (Analysis 2.2) There was no difference in the risk of postoperative vomiting for P6 acupoint stimulation compared to pooled antiemetic drugs (Analysis 2.2.6: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.31) ( Agarwal 2002 ; Barsoum 1990 ; Butkovic 2005 ; Dundee 1989 ; Gan 2004 ; Ho 1989 ; Misra 2005 ; Schultz 2003 ; Sharma 2007 ; Tavlan 1996 ; Wang 2002 ; White 2002 ; Yang 1993 ; Yentis 1992 ). Trial results were homogeneous (I2 = 0%) ( Figure 11 ). The ’trim and fill’ method did not trim or add any more studies to the contour-enhanced funnel plot ( Figure 12 ). There was no evidence of an interaction between the effect of P6 stimulation and the prespecified sensitivity and subgroup analyses: sequence generation (Analyses 2.2.7, 2.2.8: z statistic ?0.04, P = 0.97); allocation concealment (Analyses 2.2.9, 2.2.10: z statistic 0.64, P = 0.52); blinding of outcome assessor (Analyses 2.2.11, 2.2.12: z statistic ?0.18, P = 0.86); selective reporting (Analyses 2.2.13, 2.2.14: z statistic ?0.56, P = 0.58). Rescue antiemetic (Analysis 2.3) There was no difference in the risk of requiring rescue antiemetics for P6 acupoint stimulation compared to pooled antiemetic drugs (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.13) ( Agarwal 2002 ; Butkovic 2005 ; Gan 2004 ; Misra 2005 ; Sharma 2007 ; Wang 2002 ; White 2002 ). Trial results were homogeneous (I2 = 0%) ( Figure 13 ). Side effects Restlessness was less frequent in the acupuncture group than after roperidol (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.87) ( Yentis 1992 ). P6 acupoint stimulation and antiemetic combination versus sham One trial examined this comparison ( Schultz 2003 ). There was no difference between groups for the risk of nausea (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.55) and vomiting (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.21).

CI: Confidence interval; RR: Risk ratio; GRADE Working Group grades of evidance High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.

Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate. 1 No risk factors for postoperative nausea and vomiting typically have control rates of 10%; most studies in this systematic review had high risk patients with two or more risk factors for postoperative nausea and vomiting, therefore we assumed a risk of 40%. 2 Total number of events is less than 300 3 Restlessness was more frequent after droperidol group than after acupuncture.  RESULTS Description of studies See: Characteristics of included studies ; Characteristics of excluded studies . The search identified 67 trials of P6 acupoint stimulation for PONV. The flow chart ( Figure 1 ) shows the results of the literature search (the number of hits) and the culling process to reduce the total to 40 included studies. Included studies We included 40 trials, involving 4858 participants, conducted between 1986 and 2008. All trials but one ( Gieron 1993 ) were published in English. Most trials recruited healthy adults undergoing elective surgery. Seven trials recruited children ( Butkovic 2005 ; Lewis 1991 ; Rusy 2002 ; Schlager 1998 ; Shenkman 1999 ; Wang 2002 ; Yentis 1992 ). One trial recruited both children and adults ( Amir 2007 ). Most participants had general anaesthesia. Women having elective Caesarean delivery received spinal anaesthesia in four studies ( Duggal 1998 ; Habib 2006 ; Harmon 2000 ; Ho 1996 ). There were 10 types of P6 acupoint stimulation: needle acupuncture ( Dundee 1986 ; Dundee 1989 ; Sharma 2007 ; Streitberger 2004 ; Yentis 1992 ); infiltration of dextrose ( Tavlan 1996 ; Wang 2002 ; Yang 1993 ); semipermanent needles ( Andrzejowski 1996 ); electrical stimulation of needles ( Amir 2007 ; Dundee 1989 ; Ho 1989 ; Rusy 2002 ); transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( Fassoulaki 1993 ; Gan 2004 ; Habib 2006 ; Ho 1989 ); laser stimulation ( Butkovic 2005 ; Schlager 1998 ); an acu-stimulation device ( White 2002 ; Zarate 2001 ); and acupressure ( Agarwal 2000 ; Agarwal 2002 ; Alkaissi 1999 ; Alkaissi 2002 ; Allen 1994 ; Barsoum 1990 ; Duggal 1998 ; Ferrara-Love 1996 ; Gieron 1993 ; Harmon 1999 ; Harmon 2000 ; Ho 1996 ; Klein 2004 ; Lewis 1991 ; Samad 2003 ; Schultz 2003 ; Turgut 2007 ). Two studies used conventional peripheral nerve stimulation ( Arnberger 2007 ; Liu 2008 ). One trial each used: both acupressure and acupuncture ( Shenkman 1999 ); and a capsicum plaster ( Misra 2005 ). The type of surgery; type, timing, and duration of stimulation of the P6 acupoint; and the follow-up time for assessing PONV varied greatly. P6 stimulation was compared with five antiemetic drugs: metoclopramide ( Butkovic 2005 ; Dundee 1989 ); cyclizine ( Dundee 1989 ); prochlorperazine ( Barsoum 1990 ; Ho 1989 ); droperidol ( Schultz 2003 ; Wang 2002 ; Yang 1993 ; Yentis 1992 ); and ondansetron ( Agarwal 2002 ; Gan 2004 ; Misra 2005 ; Sharma 2007 ; Tavlan 1996 ; White 2002 ). Excluded studies We excluded 27 trials. Please see ’ Characteristics of excluded studies ’ for more information. Risk of bias in included studies Allocation sequence was generated using a computer-generated random numbers table ( Agarwal 2000 ; Arnberger 2007 ; Gan 2004 ; Harmon 1999 ; Ho 1996 ; Klein 2004 ; Misra 2005 ; White 2002 ; Zarate 2001 ), a table of random numbers ( Agarwal 2002 ; Duggal 1998 ; Liu 2008 ; Samad 2003 ; Schultz 2003 ), a block design procedure ( Rusy 2002 ), and a yoking randomization based on a computer-generated list ( Wang 2002 ). Four of the 40 trials reported adequate allocation concealment ( Arnberger 2007 ; Gan 2004 ; Schultz 2003 ; Streitberger 2004 ). In 34 trials the allocation concealment was unclear, and in one trial ( Ferrara-Love 1996 ) it was inadequate. Patients were not blinded in one study ( Sharma 2007 ) because acupuncture needles inserted before induction of anaesthesia had to be kept in situ in the operating room in two of the three intervention groups. There was no blinding of healthcare providers in two studies ( Arnberger 2007 ; Sharma 2007 ). The outcome assessor was not blinded in two studies ( Gieron 1993 ; Sharma 2007 ). Twelve trials did not report all four outcomes: postoperative nausea, postoperative vomiting, rescue antiemetic drugs, and adverse events in their studies ( Alkaissi 1999 ; Allen 1994 ; Barsoum 1990 ; Butkovic 2005 ; Fassoulaki 1993 ; Ferrara-Love 1996 ; Habib 2006 ; Harmon 2000 ; Ho 1989 ; Lewis 1991 ; Schultz 2003 ; Yang 1993 ). All studies except one ( Dundee 1989 ) reported the between-group comparisons of baseline characteristics. A ’Risk of bias’ graph captures the review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item, presented as percentages across all included trials ( Figure 2 ). A ’Risk of bias’ summary captures the review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item for each included trial ( Figure 3 ). There was one study with a low risk of bias ( Gan 2004 ), as all key domains were rated ’Yes’. Of the 16 studies with a high risk of bias (one or more key domains were rated ’No’), 12 of these were due to selective reporting. The risk of bias in the remaining 23 studies was unclear. Effects of interventions See: Summary of findings for the main comparison; Summary of findings 2 P6 acupoint stimulation versus sham treatment Nausea (see Analysis 1.1) Twenty-seven trials examined P6 acupoint stimulation for the prevention of nausea, in a total of 2962 participants (Analysis 1.1). P6 acupoint stimulation reduced the risk of nausea (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.83) but there was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 60%) ( Figure 4 ). The ’trim and fill’ method did not trim or add any more studies to the contour-enhanced funnel plot ( Figure 5 ). The estimated number needed to treat for different baseline risks of nausea is shown in ’Additional Table 1 ’. There was no evidence of an interaction between the estimated effect of P6 stimulation and the sensitivity and subgroup analyses that were prespecified: adequate compared with unclear or inadequate sequence generation (Analyses 1.1.2, 1.1.3: z statistic ?0.79, P = 0.43); allocation concealment (Analyses 1.1.4, 1.1.5: z statistic 0.32, P = 0.75); blinding of outcome assessor (Analyses 1.1.6, 1.1.7: z statistic ?1.64, P = 0.10); selective reporting (Analyses 1.1.8, 1.1.9: z statistic ?0.72, P = 0.47); control event rates ? 20% or more than 20% (Analyses 1.1.10, 1.1.11: z statistic 0.70, P = 0.48); children compared with adults (Analyses 1.1.12, 1.1.13: z statistic ?1.13, P = 0.26); invasive compared with noninvasive P6 acupoint stimulation (Analyses 1.1.14, 1.1.15: z statistic ?0.63, P = 0.53). Vomiting (see Analysis 1.2) Thirty-two trials examined P6 acupoint stimulation for the prevention of vomiting, in 3385 participants. P6 acupoint stimulation reduced the risk of vomiting (RR 0.70, 95%CI 0.59 to 0.83) but there was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 53%) ( Figure 6 ). The ’trim and fill’ method did not trim or add any more studies to the contour-enhanced funnel plot ( Figure 7 ). The estimated number needed to treat for different baseline risks of vomiting is shown in ’Additional Table 1 ’. There was no evidence of an interaction between the estimated effect of P6 stimulation and the prespecified sensitivity and subgroup analyses: adequate compared with unclear or inadequate sequence generation (Analyses 1.1.2, 1.1.3: z statistic 0.42, P = 0.68); allocation concealment (Analyses 1.1.4, 1.1.5: z statistic 0.25, P = 0.80); blinding of outcome assessor (Analyses 1.1.6, 1.1.7: z statistic 0, P = 1.00); selective reporting (Analyses 1.1.8, 1.1.9: z statistic 0.24, P = 0.81); control event rates ? 20% or more than 20% (Analyses 1.1.10, 1.1.11: z statistic 1.10, P = 0.27); children compared with adults (Analyses 1.1.12, 1.1.13: z statistic ?0.41, P = 0.68); invasive compared with noninvasive P6 acupoint stimulation (Analyses 1.1.14, 1.1.15, z statistic ?0.85, P = 0.40). Rescue antiemetic (Analysis 1.3) The risk that a rescue antiemetic was required was less after P6 stimulation than after sham treatment (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.83) ( Figure 8 ). There was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 43%). Three trials did not specify the type of rescue antiemetic drug used ( Alkaissi 2002 ; Duggal 1998 ; Ferrara-Love 1996 ). We included the data excluded by one trial for persistent vomiting ( Fassoulaki 1993 ). Side effects Overall, the side effects associated with P6 acupoint stimulation were minor and self-limiting. No side effects were observed for patients receiving acupuncture ( Dundee 1986 ; Dundee 1989 ; Sharma 2007 ); acupressure, in several trials ( Agarwal 2000 ; Agarwal 2002 ; Gieron 1993 ; Harmon 1999 ; Ho 1996 ; Klein 2004 ; Lewis 1991 ); or transcutaneous electro-acupoint stimulation by a peripheral nerve stimulator ( Liu 2008 ). Haematomas occurred in one patient in the acupuncture group and in two patients in the placebo acupuncture group ( Streitberger 2004 ). Although no side effects were reported in associated with an acu-stimulation device ( White 2002 ), another trial reported mild cutaneous irritation ( Zarate 2001 ). Pain was reported at the acupuncture site in one trial ( Yang 1993 ). There was no significant difference in the incidence of redness and irritation at the puncture site between P6 acupoint stimulation and sham treatment groups ( Shenkman 1999 ). Patients complained of feeling tired and sleepy during electro-acupuncture stimulation ( Ho 1989 ). Two trials ( Alkaissi 2002 ; Duggal 1998 ) reported that acupressure bands felt uncomfortable; produced red indentation; or caused itching, headache and dizziness, swollen wrists, and blistering at the site of the button. One patient complained of mild irritation at the site of capsicum plaster application ( Misra 2005 ). P6 acupoint stimulation versus antiemetic drug Nausea (Analysis 2.1) There was no difference in the risk of postoperative nausea for P6 acupoint stimulation compared to pooled antiemetic drugs (Analysis 2.1.6: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.13) ( Agarwal 2002 ; Dundee 1989 ; Gan 2004 ; Misra 2005 ; Schultz 2003 ; Sharma 2007 ; Tavlan 1996 ; Wang 2002 ; White 2002 ). There was minor heterogeneity between the trials (I2 = 37%) ( Figure 9 ). The ’trim and fill’ method did not trim or add any more studies to the contour-enhanced funnel plot ( Figure 10 ). The level of sequence generation modified the estimated effect of P6 stimulation on nausea (Analyses 2.1.7, 2.1.8: z statistic 2.02, P = 0.04). There was no evidence of any interaction between the estimated effect of P6 stimulation and the prespecified sensitivity and subgroup analyses: allocation concealment (Analyses 2.1.9, 2.1.10: z statistic 0.27, P = 0.79); blinding of outcome assessor (Analyses 2.1.11, 2.1.12: z statistic ?1.03, P = 0.30); selective reporting (Analyses 2.1.13, 2.1.14: z statistic 0.15, P = 0.88). Vomiting (Analysis 2.2) There was no difference in the risk of postoperative vomiting for P6 acupoint stimulation compared to pooled antiemetic drugs (Analysis 2.2.6: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.31) ( Agarwal 2002 ; Barsoum 1990 ; Butkovic 2005 ; Dundee 1989 ; Gan 2004 ; Ho 1989 ; Misra 2005 ; Schultz 2003 ; Sharma 2007 ; Tavlan 1996 ; Wang 2002 ; White 2002 ; Yang 1993 ; Yentis 1992 ). Trial results were homogeneous (I2 = 0%) ( Figure 11 ). The ’trim and fill’ method did not trim or add any more studies to the contour-enhanced funnel plot ( Figure 12 ). There was no evidence of an interaction between the effect of P6 stimulation and the prespecified sensitivity and subgroup analyses: sequence generation (Analyses 2.2.7, 2.2.8: z statistic ?0.04, P = 0.97); allocation concealment (Analyses 2.2.9, 2.2.10: z statistic 0.64, P = 0.52); blinding of outcome assessor (Analyses 2.2.11, 2.2.12: z statistic ?0.18, P = 0.86); selective reporting (Analyses 2.2.13, 2.2.14: z statistic ?0.56, P = 0.58). Rescue antiemetic (Analysis 2.3) There was no difference in the risk of requiring rescue antiemetics for P6 acupoint stimulation compared to pooled antiemetic drugs (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.13) ( Agarwal 2002 ; Butkovic 2005 ; Gan 2004 ; Misra 2005 ; Sharma 2007 ; Wang 2002 ; White 2002 ). Trial results were homogeneous (I2 = 0%) ( Figure 13 ). Side effects Restlessness was less frequent in the acupuncture group than after roperidol (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.87) ( Yentis 1992 ). P6 acupoint stimulation and antiemetic combination versus sham One trial examined this comparison ( Schultz 2003 ). There was no difference between groups for the risk of nausea (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.55) and vomiting (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.21).

There were 10 types of P6 acupoint stimulation: needle acupuncture ( Dundee 1986 ; Dundee 1989 ; Sharma 2007 ; Streitberger 2004 ; Yentis 1992 ); infiltration of dextrose ( Tavlan 1996 ; Wang 2002 ; Yang 1993 ); semipermanent needles ( Andrzejowski 1996 ); electrical stimulation of needles ( Amir 2007 ; Dundee 1989 ; Ho 1989 ; Rusy 2002 ); transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( Fassoulaki 1993 ; Gan 2004 ; Habib 2006 ; Ho 1989 ); laser stimulation ( Butkovic 2005 ; Schlager 1998 ); an acu-stimulation device ( White 2002 ; Zarate 2001 ); and acupressure ( Agarwal 2000 ; Agarwal 2002 ; Alkaissi 1999 ; Alkaissi 2002 ; Allen 1994 ; Barsoum 1990 ; Duggal 1998 ; Ferrara-Love 1996 ; Gieron 1993 ; Harmon 1999 ; Harmon 2000 ; Ho 1996 ; Klein 2004 ; Lewis 1991 ; Samad 2003 ; Schultz 2003 ; Turgut 2007 ). Two studies used conventional peripheral nerve stimulation ( Arnberger 2007 ; Liu 2008 ). One trial each used: both acupressure and acupuncture ( Shenkman 1999 ); and a capsicum plaster ( Misra 2005 ). The type of surgery; type, timing, and duration of stimulation of the P6 acupoint; and the follow-up time for assessing PONV varied greatly. P6 stimulation was compared with five antiemetic drugs: metoclopramide ( Butkovic 2005 ; Dundee 1989 ); cyclizine ( Dundee 1989 ); prochlorperazine ( Barsoum 1990 ; Ho 1989 ); droperidol ( Schultz 2003 ; Wang 2002 ; Yang 1993 ; Yentis 1992 ); and ondansetron ( Agarwal 2002 ; Gan 2004 ; Misra 2005 ; Sharma 2007 ; Tavlan 1996 ; White 2002 ).  Included studies We included 40 trials, involving 4858 participants, conducted between 1986 and 2008. All trials but one ( Gieron 1993 ) were published in English. Most trials recruited healthy adults undergoing elective surgery. Seven trials recruited children ( Butkovic 2005 ; Lewis 1991 ; Rusy 2002 ; Schlager 1998 ; Shenkman 1999 ; Wang 2002 ; Yentis 1992 ). One trial recruited both children and adults ( Amir 2007 ). Most participants had general anaesthesia.

Risk of bias in included studies Allocation sequence was generated using a computer-generated random numbers table ( Agarwal 2000 ; Arnberger 2007 ; Gan 2004 ; Harmon 1999 ; Ho 1996 ; Klein 2004 ; Misra 2005 ; White 2002 ; Zarate 2001 ), a table of random numbers ( Agarwal 2002 ; Duggal 1998 ; Liu 2008 ; Samad 2003 ; Schultz 2003 ), a block design procedure ( Rusy 2002 ), and a yoking randomization based on a computer-generated list ( Wang 2002 ). Four of the 40 trials reported adequate allocation concealment ( Arnberger 2007 ; Gan 2004 ; Schultz 2003 ; Streitberger 2004 ). In 34 trials the allocation concealment was unclear, and in one trial ( Ferrara-Love 1996 ) it was inadequate. Patients were not blinded in one study ( Sharma 2007 ) because acupuncture needles inserted before induction of anaesthesia had to be kept in situ in the operating room in two of the three intervention groups. There was no blinding of healthcare providers in two studies ( Arnberger 2007 ; Sharma 2007 ). The outcome assessor was not blinded in two studies ( Gieron 1993 ; Sharma 2007 ). Twelve trials did not report all four outcomes: postoperative nausea, postoperative vomiting, rescue antiemetic drugs, and adverse events in their studies ( Alkaissi 1999 ; Allen 1994 ; Barsoum 1990 ; Butkovic 2005 ; Fassoulaki 1993 ; Ferrara-Love 1996 ; Habib 2006 ; Harmon 2000 ; Ho 1989 ; Lewis 1991 ; Schultz 2003 ; Yang 1993 ). All studies except one ( Dundee 1989 ) reported the between-group comparisons of baseline characteristics. A ’Risk of bias’ graph captures the review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item, presented as percentages across all included trials ( Figure 2 ). A ’Risk of bias’ summary captures the review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item for each included trial ( Figure 3 ). There was one study with a low risk of bias ( Gan 2004 ), as all key domains were rated ’Yes’. Of the 16 studies with a high risk of bias (one or more key domains were rated ’No’), 12 of these were due to selective reporting. The risk of bias in the remaining 23 studies was unclear.

Effects of interventions See: Summary of findings for the main comparison; Summary of findings 2 P6 acupoint stimulation versus sham treatment Nausea (see Analysis 1.1) Twenty-seven trials examined P6 acupoint stimulation for the prevention of nausea, in a total of 2962 participants (Analysis 1.1). P6 acupoint stimulation reduced the risk of nausea (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.83) but there was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 60%) ( Figure 4 ). The ’trim and fill’ method did not trim or add any more studies to the contour-enhanced funnel plot ( Figure 5 ). The estimated number needed to treat for different baseline risks of nausea is shown in ’Additional Table 1 ’. There was no evidence of an interaction between the estimated effect of P6 stimulation and the sensitivity and subgroup analyses that were prespecified: adequate compared with unclear or inadequate sequence generation (Analyses 1.1.2, 1.1.3: z statistic ?0.79, P = 0.43); allocation concealment (Analyses 1.1.4, 1.1.5: z statistic 0.32, P = 0.75); blinding of outcome assessor (Analyses 1.1.6, 1.1.7: z statistic ?1.64, P = 0.10); selective reporting (Analyses 1.1.8, 1.1.9: z statistic ?0.72, P = 0.47); control event rates ? 20% or more than 20% (Analyses 1.1.10, 1.1.11: z statistic 0.70, P = 0.48); children compared with adults (Analyses 1.1.12, 1.1.13: z statistic ?1.13, P = 0.26); invasive compared with noninvasive P6 acupoint stimulation (Analyses 1.1.14, 1.1.15: z statistic ?0.63, P = 0.53). Vomiting (see Analysis 1.2) Thirty-two trials examined P6 acupoint stimulation for the prevention of vomiting, in 3385 participants. P6 acupoint stimulation reduced the risk of vomiting (RR 0.70, 95%CI 0.59 to 0.83) but there was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 53%) ( Figure 6 ). The ’trim and fill’ method did not trim or add any more studies to the contour-enhanced funnel plot ( Figure 7 ). The estimated number needed to treat for different baseline risks of vomiting is shown in ’Additional Table 1 ’. There was no evidence of an interaction between the estimated effect of P6 stimulation and the prespecified sensitivity and subgroup analyses: adequate compared with unclear or inadequate sequence generation (Analyses 1.1.2, 1.1.3: z statistic 0.42, P = 0.68); allocation concealment (Analyses 1.1.4, 1.1.5: z statistic 0.25, P = 0.80); blinding of outcome assessor (Analyses 1.1.6, 1.1.7: z statistic 0, P = 1.00); selective reporting (Analyses 1.1.8, 1.1.9: z statistic 0.24, P = 0.81); control event rates ? 20% or more than 20% (Analyses 1.1.10, 1.1.11: z statistic 1.10, P = 0.27); children compared with adults (Analyses 1.1.12, 1.1.13: z statistic ?0.41, P = 0.68); invasive compared with noninvasive P6 acupoint stimulation (Analyses 1.1.14, 1.1.15, z statistic ?0.85, P = 0.40). Rescue antiemetic (Analysis 1.3) The risk that a rescue antiemetic was required was less after P6 stimulation than after sham treatment (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.83) ( Figure 8 ). There was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 43%). Three trials did not specify the type of rescue antiemetic drug used ( Alkaissi 2002 ; Duggal 1998 ; Ferrara-Love 1996 ). We included the data excluded by one trial for persistent vomiting ( Fassoulaki 1993 ). Side effects Overall, the side effects associated with P6 acupoint stimulation were minor and self-limiting. No side effects were observed for patients receiving acupuncture ( Dundee 1986 ; Dundee 1989 ; Sharma 2007 ); acupressure, in several trials ( Agarwal 2000 ; Agarwal 2002 ; Gieron 1993 ; Harmon 1999 ; Ho 1996 ; Klein 2004 ; Lewis 1991 ); or transcutaneous electro-acupoint stimulation by a peripheral nerve stimulator ( Liu 2008 ). Haematomas occurred in one patient in the acupuncture group and in two patients in the placebo acupuncture group ( Streitberger 2004 ). Although no side effects were reported in associated with an acu-stimulation device ( White 2002 ), another trial reported mild cutaneous irritation ( Zarate 2001 ). Pain was reported at the acupuncture site in one trial ( Yang 1993 ). There was no significant difference in the incidence of redness and irritation at the puncture site between P6 acupoint stimulation and sham treatment groups ( Shenkman 1999 ). Patients complained of feeling tired and sleepy during electro-acupuncture stimulation ( Ho 1989 ). Two trials ( Alkaissi 2002 ; Duggal 1998 ) reported that acupressure bands felt uncomfortable; produced red indentation; or caused itching, headache and dizziness, swollen wrists, and blistering at the site of the button. One patient complained of mild irritation at the site of capsicum plaster application ( Misra 2005 ). P6 acupoint stimulation versus antiemetic drug Nausea (Analysis 2.1) There was no difference in the risk of postoperative nausea for P6 acupoint stimulation compared to pooled antiemetic drugs (Analysis 2.1.6: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.13) ( Agarwal 2002 ; Dundee 1989 ; Gan 2004 ; Misra 2005 ; Schultz 2003 ; Sharma 2007 ; Tavlan 1996 ; Wang 2002 ; White 2002 ). There was minor heterogeneity between the trials (I2 = 37%) ( Figure 9 ). The ’trim and fill’ method did not trim or add any more studies to the contour-enhanced funnel plot ( Figure 10 ). The level of sequence generation modified the estimated effect of P6 stimulation on nausea (Analyses 2.1.7, 2.1.8: z statistic 2.02, P = 0.04). There was no evidence of any interaction between the estimated effect of P6 stimulation and the prespecified sensitivity and subgroup analyses: allocation concealment (Analyses 2.1.9, 2.1.10: z statistic 0.27, P = 0.79); blinding of outcome assessor (Analyses 2.1.11, 2.1.12: z statistic ?1.03, P = 0.30); selective reporting (Analyses 2.1.13, 2.1.14: z statistic 0.15, P = 0.88). Vomiting (Analysis 2.2) There was no difference in the risk of postoperative vomiting for P6 acupoint stimulation compared to pooled antiemetic drugs (Analysis 2.2.6: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.31) ( Agarwal 2002 ; Barsoum 1990 ; Butkovic 2005 ; Dundee 1989 ; Gan 2004 ; Ho 1989 ; Misra 2005 ; Schultz 2003 ; Sharma 2007 ; Tavlan 1996 ; Wang 2002 ; White 2002 ; Yang 1993 ; Yentis 1992 ). Trial results were homogeneous (I2 = 0%) ( Figure 11 ). The ’trim and fill’ method did not trim or add any more studies to the contour-enhanced funnel plot ( Figure 12 ). There was no evidence of an interaction between the effect of P6 stimulation and the prespecified sensitivity and subgroup analyses: sequence generation (Analyses 2.2.7, 2.2.8: z statistic ?0.04, P = 0.97); allocation concealment (Analyses 2.2.9, 2.2.10: z statistic 0.64, P = 0.52); blinding of outcome assessor (Analyses 2.2.11, 2.2.12: z statistic ?0.18, P = 0.86); selective reporting (Analyses 2.2.13, 2.2.14: z statistic ?0.56, P = 0.58). Rescue antiemetic (Analysis 2.3) There was no difference in the risk of requiring rescue antiemetics for P6 acupoint stimulation compared to pooled antiemetic drugs (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.13) ( Agarwal 2002 ; Butkovic 2005 ; Gan 2004 ; Misra 2005 ; Sharma 2007 ; Wang 2002 ; White 2002 ). Trial results were homogeneous (I2 = 0%) ( Figure 13 ). Side effects Restlessness was less frequent in the acupuncture group than after roperidol (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.87) ( Yentis 1992 ). P6 acupoint stimulation and antiemetic combination versus sham One trial examined this comparison ( Schultz 2003 ). There was no difference between groups for the risk of nausea (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.55) and vomiting (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.21).

The corresponding risk (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI). CI: Confidence interval; RR: Risk ratio; GRADE Working Group grades of evidance High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate. 1 No risk factors for postoperative nausea and vomiting typically have control rates of 10%; most studies in this systematic review had high risk patients with two or more risk factors for postoperative nausea and vomiting, therefore we assumed a risk of 40%. 2 Total number of events is less than 300 3 Restlessness was more frequent after droperidol group than after acupuncture.

Rescue antiemetic (Analysis 1.3) The risk that a rescue antiemetic was required was less after P6 stimulation than after sham treatment (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.83) ( Figure 8 ). There was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 43%). Three trials did not specify the type of rescue antiemetic drug used ( Alkaissi 2002 ; Duggal 1998 ; Ferrara-Love 1996 ). We included the data excluded by one trial for persistent vomiting ( Fassoulaki 1993 ). Side effects Overall, the side effects associated with P6 acupoint stimulation were minor and self-limiting. No side effects were observed for patients receiving acupuncture ( Dundee 1986 ; Dundee 1989 ; Sharma 2007 ); acupressure, in several trials ( Agarwal 2000 ; Agarwal 2002 ; Gieron 1993 ; Harmon 1999 ; Ho 1996 ; Klein 2004 ; Lewis 1991 ); or transcutaneous electro-acupoint stimulation by a peripheral nerve stimulator ( Liu 2008 ). Haematomas occurred in one patient in the acupuncture group and in two patients in the placebo acupuncture group ( Streitberger 2004 ).

Rescue antiemetic (Analysis 2.3) There was no difference in the risk of requiring rescue antiemetics for P6 acupoint stimulation compared to pooled antiemetic drugs (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.13) ( Agarwal 2002 ; Butkovic 2005 ; Gan 2004 ; Misra 2005 ; Sharma 2007 ; Wang 2002 ; White 2002 ). Trial results were homogeneous (I2 = 0%) ( Figure 13 ). Side effects Restlessness was less frequent in the acupuncture group than after roperidol (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.87) ( Yentis 1992 ). P6 acupoint stimulation and antiemetic combination versus sham One trial examined this comparison ( Schultz 2003 ). There was no difference between groups for the risk of nausea (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.55) and vomiting (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.21). ADDITIONAL SUMMARY OF FINDINGS [Explanation] Acupoint P6 stimulation versus sham to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting Patient or population: patients with a desire to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting Settings: Surgery Intervention: Acupoint P6 stimulation versus antiemetic Outcomes Illustrative comparative risks * (95% CI) Relative effect (95% CI) No of Participants (studies) Quality of the evidence (GRADE) Comments Assumed risk Corresponding risk Control Acupoint P6 stimulation versus sham Nausea - All antiemetics combined Low risk population 1 RR 0.82 (0.6 to 1.13) 660 (9) ???? moderate 2 100 per 1000 82 per 1000 (60 to 113) High risk population 1 400 per 1000 328 per 1000 (240 to 452) Vomiting - All antiemetics combined Low risk population 1 RR 1.01 (0.77 to 1.31) 1036 (14) ???? moderate 2 100 per 1000 101 per 1000 (77 to 131) High risk population 1 400 per 1000 404 per 1000 (308 to 524) Rescue antiemetic Medium risk population RR 0.82 (0.59 to 1.13) 527 (7) ???? moderate 2 180 per 1000 148 per 1000 (106 to 203) Adverse effects 3 633 per 1000 298 per 1000 (165 to 551) RR 0.47 (0.26 to 0.87) 60 (1) * The basis for the assumed risk (e.g. the median control group risk across studies) is provided in footnotes. The corresponding risk (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI). CI: Confidence interval; RR: Risk ratio; GRADE Working Group grades of evidance High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate. 1 No risk factors for postoperative nausea and vomiting typically have control rates of 10%; most studies in this systematic review had high risk patients with two or more risk factors for postoperative nausea and vomiting, therefore we assumed a risk of 40%. 2 Total number of events is less than 300 3 Restlessness was more frequent after droperidol group than after acupuncture.  P6 acupoint stimulation versus sham treatment Nausea (see Analysis 1.1) Twenty-seven trials examined P6 acupoint stimulation for the prevention of nausea, in a total of 2962 participants (Analysis 1.1). P6 acupoint stimulation reduced the risk of nausea (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.83) but there was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 60%) ( Figure 4 ). The ’trim and fill’ method did not trim or add any more studies to the contour-enhanced funnel plot ( Figure 5 ). The estimated number needed to treat for different baseline risks of nausea is shown in ’Additional Table 1 ’. There was no evidence of an interaction between the estimated effect of P6 stimulation and the sensitivity and subgroup analyses that were prespecified: adequate compared with unclear or inadequate sequence generation (Analyses 1.1.2, 1.1.3: z statistic ?0.79, P = 0.43); allocation concealment (Analyses 1.1.4, 1.1.5: z statistic 0.32, P = 0.75); blinding of outcome assessor (Analyses 1.1.6, 1.1.7: z statistic ?1.64, P = 0.10); selective reporting (Analyses 1.1.8, 1.1.9: z statistic ?0.72, P = 0.47); control event rates ? 20% or more than 20% (Analyses 1.1.10, 1.1.11: z statistic 0.70, P = 0.48); children compared with adults (Analyses 1.1.12, 1.1.13: z statistic ?1.13, P = 0.26); invasive compared with noninvasive P6 acupoint stimulation (Analyses 1.1.14, 1.1.15: z statistic ?0.63, P = 0.53). Vomiting (see Analysis 1.2) Thirty-two trials examined P6 acupoint stimulation for the prevention of vomiting, in 3385 participants. P6 acupoint stimulation reduced the risk of vomiting (RR 0.70, 95%CI 0.59 to 0.83) but there was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 53%) ( Figure 6 ). The ’trim and fill’ method did not trim or add any more studies to the contour-enhanced funnel plot ( Figure 7 ). The estimated number needed to treat for different baseline risks of vomiting is shown in ’Additional Table 1 ’. There was no evidence of an interaction between the estimated effect of P6 stimulation and the prespecified sensitivity and subgroup analyses: adequate compared with unclear or inadequate sequence generation (Analyses 1.1.2, 1.1.3: z statistic 0.42, P = 0.68); allocation concealment (Analyses 1.1.4, 1.1.5: z statistic 0.25, P = 0.80); blinding of outcome assessor (Analyses 1.1.6, 1.1.7: z statistic 0, P = 1.00); selective reporting (Analyses 1.1.8, 1.1.9: z statistic 0.24, P = 0.81); control event rates ? 20% or more than 20% (Analyses 1.1.10, 1.1.11: z statistic 1.10, P = 0.27); children compared with adults (Analyses 1.1.12, 1.1.13: z statistic ?0.41, P = 0.68); invasive compared with noninvasive P6 acupoint stimulation (Analyses 1.1.14, 1.1.15, z statistic ?0.85, P = 0.40). Rescue antiemetic (Analysis 1.3) The risk that a rescue antiemetic was required was less after P6 stimulation than after sham treatment (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.83) ( Figure 8 ). There was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 43%). Three trials did not specify the type of rescue antiemetic drug used ( Alkaissi 2002 ; Duggal 1998 ; Ferrara-Love 1996 ). We included the data excluded by one trial for persistent vomiting ( Fassoulaki 1993 ). Side effects Overall, the side effects associated with P6 acupoint stimulation were minor and self-limiting. No side effects were observed for patients receiving acupuncture ( Dundee 1986 ; Dundee 1989 ; Sharma 2007 ); acupressure, in several trials ( Agarwal 2000 ; Agarwal 2002 ; Gieron 1993 ; Harmon 1999 ; Ho 1996 ; Klein 2004 ; Lewis 1991 ); or transcutaneous electro-acupoint stimulation by a peripheral nerve stimulator ( Liu 2008 ). Haematomas occurred in one patient in the acupuncture group and in two patients in the placebo acupuncture group ( Streitberger 2004 ). Although no side effects were reported in associated with an acu-stimulation device ( White 2002 ), another trial reported mild cutaneous irritation ( Zarate 2001 ). Pain was reported at the acupuncture site in one trial ( Yang 1993 ). There was no significant difference in the incidence of redness and irritation at the puncture site between P6 acupoint stimulation and sham treatment groups ( Shenkman 1999 ). Patients complained of feeling tired and sleepy during electro-acupuncture stimulation ( Ho 1989 ). Two trials ( Alkaissi 2002 ; Duggal 1998 ) reported that acupressure bands felt uncomfortable; produced red indentation; or caused itching, headache and dizziness, swollen wrists, and blistering at the site of the button. One patient complained of mild irritation at the site of capsicum plaster application ( Misra 2005 ).

DISCUSSION We have shown that P6 acupoint stimulation reduces the risk of PONV compared to sham treatment. P6 acupoint stimulation prevented postoperative nausea, vomiting, and need for antiemetic rescue by similar amounts (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.83; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.83; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.83, respectively). Reduction of nausea, vomiting, and need for rescue antiemetics with P6 acupoint stimulation may reduce costs (such as antiemetic drug cost, length of stay in hospital) as well as improve quality of patient care. Although the relative risks for nausea and vomiting in subgroup analyses were not significant for control rates ? 20%, but significant for >20%, the interactions were not significant; this suggests that the P6 acupoint stimulation effect was equal across subgroups. We did not find any interaction between the effect of P6 acupoint stimulation and age (children versus adults); type of P6 acupoint stimulation (invasive versus noninvasive); quality of sequence generation (adequate versus unclear or inadequate); quality of allocation concealment (adequate versus unclear or inadequate); blinding of outcome assessors (adequate versus unclear or inadequate); and selective reporting (free of versus unclear or not free of). Therefore, the reasons for the moderate heterogeneity among the trials are not clear. The moderate heterogeneity may be due to differences in the intensity of P6 acupoint stimulation, differences in underlying risk, trials of different sizes ( Egger 1997 ), or the different timing of the outcome measures. The quality of the included trials was variable. The allocation concealment technique was adequate in only four of 40 trials whilst the generation of allocation sequence was adequate in 17 trials. Whether outcome assessors, investigators, and patients were blinded to the intervention was difficult to assess in four trials because of insufficient information. It is difficult to provide good sham treatments. There may be subtle differences between inactive ReliefBand ( Habib 2006 ; White 2002 ; Zarate 2001 ) and SeaBands with studs removed ( Barsoum 1990 ; Duggal 1998 ; Ferrara-Love 1996 ; Klein 2004 ), when placed over the P6 acupoint. Despite possible differences in sham efficacy and intrinsic bias we analysed these sham treatments in one group. Selective reporting was the main bias found in 12 of 40 trials. Althoughmeta-analyses excluding unpublished outcomes are likely to over-estimate P6 acupoint stimulation effects, we did not find any interactions between the effect of P6 acupoint stimulation and level of selective reporting. Therefore, the impact of selective reporting on the point estimates in this Cochrane review are likely to be minimal. Publication bias may be common for RCTs of traditional Chinese medicine ( Tang 1999 ). The contour-enhanced funnel plots for nausea and vomiting showed no evidence of publication bias. In contrast to our last Cochrane review ( Lee 2004 ), we did not use Egger’s test ( Egger 1997 ) for funnel plot asymmetry because it is problematic ( Higgins 2008 ). The addition of another 10 studies examining P6 acupoint stimulation versus sham for postoperative nausea since our previous Cochrane review ( Lee 2004 ) did not change the relative risk estimate. If publication bias and a country effect on the results were present, we would have expected the relative risk of nausea to be no longer significant after adjusting for country effect ( Lee 2006 ). Thus, we are confident that publication bias is minimal in this review. We did not undertake a dose-response relationship analysis for P6 acupoint stimulation time and intervention effect. Although 18 trials had sufficient data on the duration of P6 acupoint stimulation on outcomes at 24 hours after surgery, none of them randomized participants to one timing (for example 6 hours duration) or another (such as 24 hours duration). Conclusions about differences in effect due to differences in dose are strongest if participants are randomized within a study to one dose or another and a consistent relationship is found across similar studies Higgins 2008 ). Also, many meta-regression analyses have low power to detect genuine relationships ( Higgins 2008 ). Comparing P6 acupoint stimulation to prophylactic antiemetic drugs, our previous Cochrane review ( Lee 2004 ) showed a significant reduction in nausea (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.98) but not in vomiting (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.29). In this Cochrane review, after adding three small studies (< 100 participants each), we found no reliable evidence for differences in risk of postoperative nausea or vomiting after P6 acupoint stimulation compared to antiemetic drugs. For nausea, the RR was 0.82 (95%CI 0.60 to 1.13). Interestingly, the method of sequence generation modified the P6 acupoint stimulation effect; unclear or inadequate sequence generation over-estimated the effect on nausea. For vomiting, the RR was 1.01 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.31) with no significant risk of bias interactions. The wide confidence intervals around the point estimates for nausea and vomiting in this review suggest that we still have little knowledge about the effect size, and that further information is needed. Whether P6 acupoint stimulation is a useful modality within multimodal prophylaxis of PONV remains unclear. This Cochrane review identified only one trial ( Schultz 2003 ) that compared a combination of an antiemetic medication and P6 acupoint stimulation versus sham, with imprecise results.

This Cochrane review identified only one trial ( Schultz 2003 ) that compared a combination of an antiemetic medication and P6 acupoint stimulation versus sham, with imprecise results.  AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS Implications for practice Patients with a very high baseline risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting are more likely to benefit from P6 acupoint stimulation ( Table 1 ). No major side effects were associated with P6 acupoint stimulation. The risks of postoperative nausea and vomiting were similar after P6 acupoint stimulation and antiemetic drugs. P6 acupoint stimulation may be a suitable alternative or addition to antiemetic drugs for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting. Implications for research Further research is unlikely to reverse the conclusion that P6 acupoint stimulation, versus sham, reduces the risk of PONV but it is likely to alter confidence in the effect, and possibly the point estimate. Further research should investigate whether the duration of P6 acupoint stimulation alters its effect on PONV. Future research should also examine whether combinations of interventions (that is multimodal prophylaxis) works better than each component alone and whether they interact. This updated systematic review found one small study ( Schultz 2003 ) examining the combined effect of P6 acupoint stimulation administered with an antiemetic drug. Compared to sham, there was no significant reduction in PONV associated with the combined effect of P6 acupoint stimulation and droperidol ( Schultz 2003 ). Patients receiving acu-stimulation and ondansetron in combination had a higher quality of recovery than those receiving ondansetron alone but there was no difference in the risk of PONV ( White 2002 ). Therefore, the effect of combining P6 acupoint stimulation with an antiemetic medication is inconclusive and larger, rigorous trials are needed. More importantly, future trials should use adequate allocation concealment and include clinically relevant outcomes, such as quality of recovery, to draw meaningful conclusions.

Patients receiving acu-stimulation and ondansetron in combination had a higher quality of recovery than those receiving ondansetron alone but there was no difference in the risk of PONV ( White 2002 ). Therefore, the effect of combining P6 acupoint stimulation with an antiemetic medication is inconclusive and larger, rigorous trials are needed. More importantly, future trials should use adequate allocation concealment and include clinically relevant outcomes, such as quality of recovery, to draw meaningful conclusions.
