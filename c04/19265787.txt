Oxidative Stress Contributes to Soluble Fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase-1 Induced Vascular Dysfunction in Pregnant Rats BACKGROUND Recent evidence indicates that both increased oxidative stress and an altered balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors such as vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the soluble VEGF receptor (sFlt-1) contribute to endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia. We hypothesized that chronic infusion of sFlt-1 to mimic the increase observed in preeclamptic patients would reduce plasma VEGF concentrations, increase blood pressure (BP) and vascular superoxide levels, and cause endothelial dysfunction in the pregnant rat. METHODS Recombinant sFlt-1 was infused (500 ng/h) during days 13–18 of pregnancy. BP, fetal and placental weight, oxidative stress and vessel vasorelaxation were determined on day 18 of pregnancy. RESULTS Plasma sFlt-1 concentrations (299 ± 33 vs. 100 ± 16 pg/ml; P < 0.01) and BP (117 ± 6 vs. 98 ± 4 mm Hg; P < 0.01) were increased, while plasma-free VEGF concentrations (570 ± 77 vs. 780 ± 48 pg/ml; P < 0.01) were decreased when compared to vehicle infused dams. sFlt-1 rats had smaller fetuses (1.3 ± 0.03 vs. 1.5 ± 0.04 g, P < 0.01) and placentas (0.41 ± 0.01 vs. 0.47 ± 0.02 g; P < 0.05). Placental (180 ± 66 vs. 24 ± 2.3 RLU/min/mg; P < 0.05) and vascular (34 ± 8 vs. 12 ± 5 RLU/min/mg; P < 0.05) superoxide production was increased in the sFlt-1 compared to vehicle infused rats. Vasorelaxation to acetylcholine (Ach) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were both decreased ( P < 0.05) in the sFlt-1 infusion group compared to the vehicle and this decrease was attenuated ( P < 0.05) by the superoxide scavenger Tiron. CONCLUSION These data indicate elevated maternal sFlt-1 and decreased VEGF concentrations results in increased oxidative stress that contributes to vascular dysfunction during pregnancy.

METHODS Animals All experimental procedures in this study were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for use and care of animals. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Studies were performed in timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Animals were housed in a temperature-controlled room (23 °C) with a 12:12 light:dark cycle. sFlt-1 infusion protocol Pilot studies were performed to determine a proper dose and infusion protocol that would achieve the approximately threefold increase in plasma sFlt-1 previously reported in preeclamptic women. 17 On day 13 of gestation (DG 13), pregnant rats were randomly assigned to receive either sFlt-1 (sFlt-1 in sterile saline; 500 ng/h; n = 11) or vehicle (sterile saline) infused (Vehicle; n = 10) groups via a mini-osmotic pump (model 2001; Alzet, Cupertino, CA) placed intraperitoneal. Measurement of mean arterial pressure in chronically instrumented conscious rats Animals were instrumented and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was determined in both groups of rats on DG 18 as described previously. 10 , 12 , 18 Briefly, on DG 17 rats were instrumented with carotid catheters of V-3 tubing (SCI, Lake Hayasu City, AZ) while under isoflurane anesthesia (Webster, Sterling, MA) delivered by an anesthesia apparatus (Vaporizer for Forane Anesthetic; Ohio Medical Products, Madison, WI). Catheters were tunneled to the back of the neck and exteriorized after implantation. On DG 18, rat dams were placed in individual restraining cages for arterial pressure measurements using a pressure transducer (Cobe III Transducer CDX Sema, Birmingham, AL). MAP was recorded continuously for a 2-h period after 1 h of stabilization. Conceptus measurements After the measurement of MAP, the dams were placed under isoflourane anesthesia and a mid-line ventral incision was made to isolate the abdominal aorta for plasma and serum collection. The uterus was exteriorized and the number of viable and resorbed pups was counted and recorded and the pups and placentas were collected, weighed and the latter snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Vascular-ring experiments The noninstrumented carotid was removed and prepared for vessel-reactivity studies in organ-chamber baths, as previously described. 19 Carotid arteries were chosen to be consistent with our earlier work. 19 Resting tension was adjusted stepwise to reach a final tension of 0.75 g. For studies of vessel relaxation, carotid segments were precontracted with the thromboxane mimetic, U46619 (0.4 ?g/ml). After the vessel reached stable tension, concentration responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitro-prusside (SNP) (10?8 to 10?4 M) were performed to assess endothelial-dependent and smooth muscle-dependent relaxation, respectively. Vessels that were tested to examine the effects of oxidative stress due to sFlt-1 infusion were pre-incubated with Tiron (1 mmol/l) for 30 min prior to each dose–response curve. To evaluate viability of vessel segments after the final relaxation curve, maximal contractile responses to phenylephrine (10?8 to 10?4 M) were also tested. Plasma/serum assays Blood was collected for subsequent assays into Corvac sterile serum separator tubes (Sherwood Davis, St Louis, MO) and plasma into BD Vacutainer EDTA containing tubes. Circulating VEGF and sFlt-1 concentrations were measured using commercial kits available from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN) as reported previously. 10 Measurement of placental and vascular superoxide production Superoxide production in the placenta and thoracic aorta was measured using the lucigenin technique as we have previously described. 20 Briefly, placentas and thoracic aorta were removed, cleansed of extraneous tissues and homogenized (1:8 wt/vol) in RIPA buffer (phosphate buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and a protease inhibitor cocktail; Sigma, St Louis, MO) as described previously. 10 , 20 The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min, the supernatant aspirated and the remaining cellular debris discarded. The supernatant was incubated with lucigenin at a final concentration of 5 ?mol/l. The samples were allowed to equilibrate for 3 min in the dark, and luminescence was measured every second for 5–15 min with a luminometer (Berthold, Oak Ridge, TN). Luminescence was recorded as relative light units (RLUs) per min. An assay blank with no homogenate but containing lucigenin was subtracted from the reading before transformation of the data. The protein concentration was measured using a Pierce (Rockford, IL) protein assay with BSA standards. The data are expressed as RLU per min per milligram protein. Statistical analysis and calculations All data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. and statistical significance was accepted when P < 0.05. A Grubb’s test was applied to identify statistical outliers. Conceptus data were calculated as mean per pregnancy. sFlt-1:VEGF ratio data were log transformed to obtain normal distributions for subsequent statistical analysis. Comparisons between two groups were made with a t -test for independent samples and a Welch’s correction for unequal variances was applied when indicated. Myography data were analyzed by nonlinear regression best fit modeling followed by an F -test for Log of the half maximal effective concentration (EC50), Hill slope and curve fitting. A two-way repeated measure ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) was also performed to evaluate treatment effects between vehicle infused, vehicle infused+Tiron, sFlt-1, and sFlt-1 infused + Tiron rats. Statistical calculations were made with GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

RESULTS Plasma VegF and sFlt-1 Figure 1a shows that our infusion protocol increased plasma sFlt-1 threefold (299 ± 33 vs. 100 ± 16 pg/ml; P < 0.01) compared to the vehicle infused control group at 18 DG. sFlt-1 infusion also increased the sFlt-1:VEGF ratio (0.69 ± 0.15 vs. 0.32 ± 0.05; P < 0.05) while plasma-free VEGF concentrations (570 ± 77 vs. 780 ± 48 pg/ml; P < 0.01; Figure 1b ) were decreased compared to vehicle infused pregnant rats. Fetus and placental weights Fetuses from the dams infused with sFlt-1 were 10% lighter than those from NP vehicle infused rats (1.3 ± 0.03 vs. 1.5 ± 0.04 g, P < 0.01; Figure 2a ) at 18 DG. Placental weight was also decreased in the pregnant rats infused with sFlt-1 (0.41 ± 0.01 vs. 0.47 ± 0.02 g; P < 0.05; Figure 2b ) compared to the vehicle infused dams. No difference was observed in the number of fetuses at DG 18 between the sFlt-1 and vehicle (13 ± 1 vs. 14 ± 1) infused dams. BP during late gestation Figure 3a illustrates that resting MAP (117 ± 6 vs. 98 ± 4 mm Hg; P < 0.01) was increased in the sFlt-1 infused dams when contrasted to the vehicle infused dams. Superoxide production Figure 3b illustrates that superoxide production was increased in aortic homogenates of the sFlt-1 infused rats compared to the vehicle infused controls (34 ± 8 vs. 12 ± 5 RLU/min/mg; P < 0.05). In addition, placental (180 ± 66 vs. 24 ± 2.3 RLU/min/mg; P < 0.05) superoxide production was also increased in the sFlt-1 compared to vehicle infused rats. Endothelial function (wire myography) Figure 4a shows that vasorelaxation to ACh (panel A) was decreased ( P < 0.05) as evidenced by a rightward shift in the dose–response relaxation curve. Furthermore, this effect was attenuated by addition of the antioxidant Tiron to the organ chamber bath. The log EC50 for ACh (5.83 ± 0.15 vs. 5.44 ± 0.08 mol/l; P < 0.05) and the Hill slope (1.26 ± 0.26 vs. 0.64 ± 0.17; P = 0.05) were increased in the sFlt-1 infusion group compared to the vehicle infusion group. Addition of Tiron to the organ chamber bath ameliorated the difference previously observed between the sFlt-1 and vehicle infusion groups for the log EC50 of ACh (6.05 ± 0.13 vs. 5.83 ± 0.15 mol/l) and the Hill slope (0.50 ± 0.10 vs. 0.64 ± 0.17). There was no effect of Tiron observed in the vehicle infusion group (data not shown). Similarly, the relaxation response to the SNP cumulative dose–response curve ( Figure 4b ) was impaired in the sFlt-1 infusion group compared to the vehicle infused controls ( P < 0.05). Although the log EC50 for SNP was increased in the sFlt-1 group (6.25 ± 0.04 vs. 6.44 ± 0.03 mol/l; P < 0.01), the Hill slope (1.96 ± 0.04 vs. 1.5 ± 0.16) was not changed. The SNP log EC50 response (6.30 ± 0.05 vs. 6.44 ± 0.03 mol/l) of the vessels from the sFlt-1 infused group was not different compared to the NP rat vessels in the presence of Tiron. Pre-incubation with Tiron did not alter the SNP response in the vehicle infusion group (data not shown).

DISCUSSION The present study reveals several interesting and novel findings regarding the effects of sFlt-1 in the pregnant rat. Foremost, we found that sFlt-1 caused both increased BP and decreased fetal and placental weight at 18 DG in the pregnant rat. We also found that sFlt-1 infusion decreased plasma VEGF concentrations compared to vehicle infused controls. Further, we report that increased sFlt-1 and decreased VEGF is associated with vascular-endothelial dysfunction and increased superoxide production in the placenta and the vasculature. Finally, we report that oxidative stress plays a role in the vascular dysfunction in this model as addition of a superoxide scavenger attenuates impaired vascular relaxation. Considerable clinical evidence has accumulated that preeclampsia is strongly linked to an imbalance between pro-angiogenic (VEGF, PlGF) and anti-angiogenic (sFlt-1) factors in the maternal circulation. 6 , 17 , 21 Recently, studies have reported that increased sFlt-1 may have a predictive value in diagnosing preeclampsia as concentrations seem to increase before manifestation of overt symptoms (e.g., hypertension, proteinuria). 6 , 21 The importance of VEGF during hypertensive pregnancy has also recently been highlighted by Li et al. who showed that VEGF infusion attenuates the deleterious effects observed on BP in pregnant rats overexpressing sFlt-1 (ref. 13 ). Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which sFlt-1 may exert its effects have remained unclear. In the present work our infusion protocol achieved plasma concentrations of sFlt-1 that were increased threefold compared to the vehicle control group. This increase in sFlt-1 is similar to what we have reported in our reduced uterine perfusion pressure model of placental ischemia 10 and others have reported in preeclamptic patients. 17 Furthermore, this increase in sFlt-1 resulted in decreased circulating free VEGF concentrations and increased MAP similar to what has been reported by our group in the RUPP rat and others using adenovirus mediated increases of sFlt-1 in the rat. 10 , 17 In addition, we found that fetal and placental weights from the sFlt-1 infusion were 10% lighter than fetuses from normal pregnant rats. This finding is similar to what has been reported in an adenovirus mediated model of sFlt-1 hypertension during pregnancy in the mouse. 9 Hence, this model of hypertension during pregnancy may have implications with respect to the developmental origins of adult health and disease similar to what has been reported in the murine adenovirus model. 22 Previous studies in both preeclamptic women and rats with placental ischemia have demonstrated the presence of vascular-endothelial dysfunction 23 , 24 and oxidative stress. 20 , 25 Although previous work has shown that sFlt-1 attenuates VEGF induced vasorelaxation in vitro , 17 the mechanism by which this might occur has remained unclear. In the present study we show that chronic in vivo exposure to threefold increased concentrations of sFlt-1 impairs ACh and SNP-mediated vasodilation. Furthermore, we show that this effect is ameliorated by addition of Tiron, a superoxide scavenger, to the organ chamber bath suggesting that oxidative stress plays a role in the observed vascular dysfunction. While the log EC50 for SNP was increased in the sFlt-1 compared to the vehicle infused group, the Hill slope was not changed. In contrast, both the log EC50 and the hill slope were altered for ACh in the vessels from the sFlt-1 compared to the vehicle infused group. These results suggest that nitric oxide bioavailability is likely decreased in this model and that may also be additional downstream alterations in the ACh-induced vasorelaxation pathway. Further studies are required to determine the exact mechanisms of this vascular dysfunction. Although the link between oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in the present model remains unclear, previous studies have shown VEGF is an important mediator of normal endothelial function. 14 – 16 This is largely thought to occur by contributing to the maintenance of an appropriate balance of pro- and antioxidant factors via manganese superoxide dis-mutase, NADPH oxidase, and by regulating nitric oxide production. 14 – 16 Hence, it is not surprising that VEGF antagonism in the present study resulted in increased oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction. Although the present data demonstrate a novel pathway by which sFlt-1 may contribute to endothelial dysfunction and the subsequent hypertension during pregnancy, it remains unknown by which mechanisms oxidative stress is increased in this model. Moreover, it is interesting to note that subtle yet significant differences exist in the relaxation responses to ACh and SNP as a result of chronic sFlt-1 infusion during pregnancy. Further studies are planned to evaluate the NADPH oxidase pathway as well as other mechanisms that may lead to increased oxidative stress in this model. In summary, the results from the present studies confirm our hypotheses that chronic infusion of plasma sFlt-1 causes hypertension associated with increased oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Although these data show that increased oxidative stress contributes to the observed endothelial dysfunction, the mechanisms by which sFlt-1 increases oxidative stress still remain unclear. Nevertheless, the present studies are an important step toward identifying pathways that might be amenable to intervention and possibly attenuate hypertension during pregnancy.  DISCUSSION The present study reveals several interesting and novel findings regarding the effects of sFlt-1 in the pregnant rat. Foremost, we found that sFlt-1 caused both increased BP and decreased fetal and placental weight at 18 DG in the pregnant rat. We also found that sFlt-1 infusion decreased plasma VEGF concentrations compared to vehicle infused controls. Further, we report that increased sFlt-1 and decreased VEGF is associated with vascular-endothelial dysfunction and increased superoxide production in the placenta and the vasculature. Finally, we report that oxidative stress plays a role in the vascular dysfunction in this model as addition of a superoxide scavenger attenuates impaired vascular relaxation.
