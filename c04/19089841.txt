Cancer Cell Phenotype Dependent Differential Intracellular Trafficking of Unconjugated Quantum Dots A diverse array of nanoparticles, including quantum dots, metals, polymers, liposomes, and dendrimers, is being investigated as therapeutics and imaging agents in cancer disease. However, the role of the cancer cell phenotype on the uptake and intracellular fate of nanoparticles in cancer cells remains poorly understood. Here we report that differences in cancer cell phenotype can lead to significant differences in intracellular sorting, trafficking and localization of nanoparticles. Unconjugated anionic quantum dots demonstrated dramatically different intracellular profiles in three closely related human prostate cancer cells used in the current investigation: PC3, PC3-flu, and PC3-PSMA. Quantum dots demonstrated punctuated intracellular localization throughout the cytoplasm in PC3 cells. In contrast, the nanoparticles localized mainly at a single juxtanuclear location (‘dot-of-dots’) inside the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC) in PC3-PSMA cells, where they colocalized with transferrin and the Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen. Our results indicate that nanoparticle sorting and transport is influenced by changes in cancer cell phenotype, and can have significant implications in the design and engineering of nanoscale drug delivery and imaging systems for advanced tumors.
