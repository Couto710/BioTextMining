Discovery and characterization of a highly selective FAAH inhibitor that reduces inflammatory pain Endocannabinoids are lipid signaling molecules that regulate a wide range of mammalian behaviors, including pain, inflammation, and cognitive/emotional state. The endocannabinoid anandamide is principally degraded by the integral membrane enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and there is currently much interest in developing FAAH inhibitors to augment endocannabinoid signaling in vivo . Here we report the discovery and detailed characterization of a highly efficacious and selective FAAH inhibitor PF-3845. Mechanistic and structural studies confirm that PF-3845 is a covalent inhibitor that carbamylates FAAH's serine nucleophile. PF-3845 selectively inhibits FAAH in vivo as determined by activity-based protein profiling and raises brain anandamide levels for up to 24 hrs, resulting in profound cannabinoid receptor-dependent reductions in inflammatory pain. These data thus designate PF-3845 as a valuable pharmacological tool for in vivo characterization of the endocannabinoid system.  Experimental Procedures Materials N -phenyl-4-(quinolin-3-ylmethyl)piperidine-1-carboxamide (PF-750) was synthesized as described previously ( Ahn et al., 2007 ). URB597 and JP104 were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Inhibitors were stored as dry powders at RT and dissolved in DMSO to prepare concentrated stock solutions for the in vitro potency measurements. SR141716 and SR144528, selective CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonists, were synthesized at Pfizer. Polystyrene 96- and 384-microplates were purchased from Rainin and Evergreen Scientific (Los Angeles, CA), respectively. All reagents used were the highest quality commercially available. Synthesis of PF-3845 and structural analogues The synthesis of PF-3845 and other biaryl ether piperidine/piperazine ureas was performed as described in the Supplemental Methods. FAAH expression and purification All three forms of FAAH (hFAAH, rFAAH, and h/rFAAH) were expressed and purified following previously described procedures ( Mileni et al., 2008 ) and as described in the Supplemental Methods. Determination of inhibitor potency Inhibitor potencies were determined following previously described procedures ( Mileni et al., 2008 ) and as described in the Supplemental Methods. h/rFAAH crystallography Crystallization and structure determination were performed as described in the Supplemental Methods. Monte Carlo simulations of FAAH-inhibitor adducts The program ICM-Pro (Molsoft, L.L.C.) was used to simulate covalent docking of biaryl ether urea inhibitors into the active site of the h/rFAAH as described in the Supplemental Methods. As a positive control, we performed the docking of the PF-3845 ligand, which provided a conformation that closely matched the conformation observed in the PF-3845-FAAH crystal structure. Competitive ABPP studies PF-3845 or URB597 (neat) were dissolved at 1 mg/mL by sonication and vortexing directly into a solution of 18:1:1 v/v/v saline:emulphor:ethanol. Male C57Bl/6J mice (6–12 weeks old, 20–28 g) were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered PF-3845, URB597, or an 18:1:1 v/v/v saline:emulphor:ethanol vehicle at a volume of 10 ?L/g weight (10 mg/kg final dose). After the indicated amount of time, mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and sacrificed by decapitation. Brains were removed, hemisected along the midsagittal plane, and each half was then flash frozen in liquid N2. One half of the brain was homogenized in PBS (pH 7.4, 2 mL), diluted to 1 mg protein/mL, treated with FP-rhodamine (1 ?M, 0.5 hr), and analyzed by gel-based ABPP following previously described methods ( Alexander and Cravatt, 2005 ). The other half of brain was used for lipid and drug measurements as detailed in the Supplementary Methods. CC-ABPP studies CC-ABPP studies were performed following previously described procedures ( Speers et al., 2003 ; Speers and Cravatt, 2004 ; Alexander and Cravatt, 2005 ) and as detailed in the Supplementary Methods. Measurement of FAAH activity and lipid levels from rat tissues and blood leukocytes Preparation of rat tissue (brain and liver) and blood leukocytes for measuring FAAH activity and lipid levels is described in Supplementary Methods. Analysis of PF-3845 effects in the CFA model of inflammatory pain Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200g- 250g) were used for all experiments. Rats were given free access to food and water and were maintained on a 12/12-hr light/dark cycle. For the inflammatory pain model, 0.15 ml of CFA (Sigma) was injected into the plantar surface of the left hind paw of the rat. The CFA injection immediately induces local inflammation, paw swelling, and pain that persist for at least two weeks post-injection. To assess mechanical allodynia, mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds (PWTs) were measured using a set of Von Frey Hairs on day 5 post injection as illustrated by the Dixon Up and Down Method ( Dixon, 1980 ). Animals that exhibit the pain criteria of 9 g or less were then placed on study. Test compound was administered via either oral or intraperitoneal (i.p.) routes at the indicated concentrations (mg/kg) with the dosing vehicle 5% N,N -dimethylacetamide and 95% (40% 2-hydroxypropyl-?-cyclodextrin (Sigma) in water). PWTs were evaluated again at 4 hr post dosing. PWT measurements were averaged and statistical comparisons between groups were made using analysis of variance and unpaired T-tests.

Figure 2 In vivo selectivity analysis for PF-3845 and URB597 as determined by competitive ABPP. (A) Gel profiles of FP-rhodamine labeled brain serine hydrolase activities from mice treated with PF-3845 or URB597 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) for the indicated times. Note that selective blockade of FP-rhodamine labeling of FAAH is observed by both inhibitors. Representative additional brain serine hydrolases are designated based on previous ABPP studies ( Blankman et al., 2007 ; Nomura et al., 2008 ). (B) Gel profiles of FP-rhodamine-labeled liver serine hydrolase activities from mice treated with PF-3845 or URB597 (10 mg/kg, i.p., 2 hr). Note that URB597, but not PF-3845, blocks FP-rhodamine labeling of several liver serine hydrolase activities (bracket), which have previously been identified as carboxylesterases ( Alexander and Cravatt, 2005 ; Zhang et al., 2007 ). For both (A) and (B), fluorescent gel images are shown in grayscale. For (B), a lower scanning intensity is shown due to the highly abundant activity signals for carboxylesterases present in the liver proteome.

(B) Structure of JP104, an alkyne analogue of URB597 ( Alexander and Cravatt, 2005 ). (C & D) Gel profiles of CC-ABPP experiments where brain (C) or liver (D) proteomes from PF3845yne- and JP104-treated mice (10 mg/kg, i.p., 2 hr) were treated with a rhodamine-azide tag under CC conditions and analyzed by in-gel fluorescence scanning (shown in grayscale). PF3845yne selectively labels FAAH in both brain and liver tissue [60 kDa band absent in FAAH(-/-) mice], while JP104 labels several additional proteins in liver [protein bands present in both FAAH(+/+) and (-/-) mice]. Note that the 55 kDa protein band observed in liver proteome from PF-3845-treated FAAH(-/-) mice was also detected in liver proteomes from vehicle-treated FAAH(+/+) and (-/-) mice and therefore likely represents a background protein cross-reactive with the azide-rhodamine tag.

Although protein-mediated uptake pathways may exist for endocannabinoids ( Hillard and Jarrahian, 2003 ; McFarland and Barker, 2004 ; Glaser et al., 2005 ; Fowler, 2006 ), the hydrophobic nature of these lipids also grants them the ability to freely diffuse across cell membranes. This feature assigns primary responsibility for signal termination to degradative enzymes, such as FAAH. The pharmacological blockade of FAAH has, thus, emerged as a strategy to elevate endocananbinoid signaling in vivo and study the behavioral consequences. Over the past decade, several classes of FAAH inhibitors have been described that vary in their mechanism of action, potency, selectivity, and in vivo efficacy. Arguably the most well-studied FAAH inhibitor to date is URB597 ( Kathuria et al., 2003 ), a carbamate that irreversibly inhibits FAAH with high selectivity in the nervous system ( Alexander and Cravatt, 2005 ). However, URB597 displays some notable shortcomings, including the inactivation of other serine hydrolases in peripheral tissues ( Alexander and Cravatt, 2005 ; Zhang et al., 2007 ) and a relatively limited duration of action in vivo . Development of a FAAH inhibitor that displays optimal combination of efficacy and selectivity has, therefore, remained an intensely pursued objective. We have described herein the detailed characterization of an advanced piperidine urea inhibitor of FAAH, PF-3845. Our data argue PF-3845 displays remarkable selectivity for FAAH and robust efficacy in vivo , as reflected in sustained elevations of brain AEA that correlate with cannabinoid receptor-dependent reductions in inflammatory pain responses. PF-3845 also induces elevations in other non-cannabinoid NAEs (e.g., OEA, PEA), which may have additional effects on inflammation and other physiological processes ( Lambert et al., 2002 ). Structural and kinetic studies indicate that the improved potency of PF-3845 compared to previously described inhibitors (URB597, PF-750) likely originates from more extended Van der Waals contacts with the hydrophobic FAAH acyl-chain binding tunnel. This premise is also supported by SAR data generated with a set of biaryl ether analogues of PF-3845, where the introduction of polar groups within certain regions of the inhibitor scaffold severely impaired activity (e.g., compound 16 , Table 2 ). In summary, the properties of PF-3845 defined in this study indicate that this agent should be considered a frontline inhibitor for the pharmacological investigation of FAAH-regulated endocannabinoid pathways. Differentiating properties of PF-3845 include its high target selectivity, extended duration of action, and excellent oral bioavailability (> 80%, data not shown). These features should make PF-3845 particularly well suited for studying the role of the endocannabinoid system in both central and peripheral physiological processes, as well as chronic pathological syndromes (e.g., neuropathic pain, depression) that may require sustained elevations in endocannabinoid tone for rectification. Significance The endocannabinoid system regulates a number of important physiological processes in mammals and is the principal site of action for THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. THC and other direct agonists of the CB1 receptor have potentially useful medicinal properties, such as pain relief, but these activities are accompanied by a variety of untoward side effects, including impairments in motor control and cognitive function. In contrast, blockade of endocannabinoid-metabolizing enzymes such as FAAH has been shown to reduce pain sensation, inflammation, and anxiety/depression without substantial effects on motility or cognition. Despite considerable advances in the development of FAAH inhibitors, agents that combine high target selectivity with exceptional in vivo efficacy are still needed. Here, we report the discovery and detailed characterization of PF-3845, a piperidine urea FAAH inhibitor that satisfies these criteria. PF-3845 was shown by mechanistic and structural studies to covalently inactivate FAAH by carbamylation of the enzyme's serine nucleophile. PF-3845 completely inhibited FAAH activity, but did not react with other serine hydrolases in vivo , as determined by activity-based proteomics, raised brain levels of the endocannabinoid AEA for up to 24 hrs, and produced significant CB1/CB2-dependent anti-hyperalgesic effects in the CFA model of inflammatory pain. From these data, we conclude that PF-3845 is a highly selective and efficacious inhibitor of FAAH that should prove to be a valuable pharmacological tool for investigating the function of the endocannabinoid system.
