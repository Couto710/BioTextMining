CASE–CONTROL STUDY OF ORAL AND OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER IN WHITES AND GENETIC VARIATION IN EIGHT METABOLIC ENZYMES Background Genetic variation in xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes may explain differing susceptibilities to the cancer causing effects of tobacco and alcohol. Methods We compared 203 oral squamous cell carcinoma cases and 416 controls for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 genes ( CYP1A1 , CYP2E1 , MPO , mEH , GSTM1 , GSTT1 , GSTP1 , and NAT2 ). Except for NAT2 , genotype frequencies were similar in the 2 groups. We classified subjects as fast or slow NAT2 acetylators genotyping 13 NAT2 SNPs. Results Fast acetylators were overrepresented in cases (53.7%) compared with controls (43.9%; odds ratio (OR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08–2.20; p value = .03). Gene–gene interaction testing suggested several cancer-NAT2 associations, with association strongest among persons without a CYP1A1 variant (* 2C or * 4 ) allele (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.20–2.60, p value = .03) or with a variant MPO (463A) allele (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.34–4.21, p value = .05). Conclusion These results implicate fast NAT2 acetylation as a risk factor for oral cancer.  RESULTS Men, older age, personal cancer history (but not family cancer history), current cigarette smoking, current alcohol use, and ever use of cigarettes and alcohol were more frequent among the 197 oral cancer cases than the 416 controls without oral cancer ( Table 1 ). Among ever smokers and ever drinkers, respectively, lifetime cigarette smoking and alcohol dose exposures were much greater in the case group than in the control group ( Table 2 ). When assessed in the control group, 1 ( GSTP1 Ala114Val) of 21 SNPs formally evaluated appeared to violate ( p value = .03) Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The GSTP1 Ile105Val and Ala114Val SNPs were linked ( D ? = 0.79, p value <.0001). Each of the other tested 27 SNP pairs satisfied allelic independence (every p value >.05). CYP1A1 , CYP2E1 , GSTM1 , GSTT1 , mEH , MPO and GSTP1 genotypes were similar in the case and control groups ( Table 3 ). The trend, allele case–control, and genotype case–control test statistics did not identify statistically significant association involving any single CYP1A1 , CYP2E1 , mEH , MPO , or GSTP1 SNP and oral cancer (every p value >.05). Separate omnibus likelihood ratio tests did not identify statistically significant association between oral cancer and CYP1A1 , mEH , or GSTP1 haplotype (every p value >.05). Variant frequencies matched those reported in the literature, with the possible exception of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotype frequencies, which were observed at the upper end of the range of frequencies previously described for whites. Statistical control for sex, age, personal cancer history, family cancer history, smoking, and alcohol exposure variables did not alter judgments regarding the lack of association between oral cancer and CYP1A1 , CYP2E1 , GSTM1 , GSTT1 , mEH , MPO , or GSTP1 genotype (results not shown). NAT2 genotypes associated with fast NAT2 function were more frequent in the case group (53.8%) than in the control group (43.9%; p value = .03; Table 3 ). This case–control difference, observed in persons with any cigarette or alcohol exposure history, suggested 55% (age- and sex-adjusted OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.08–2.20) higher oral cancer risk in association with a fast NAT2 acetylator status. Adjustments for personal cancer history and family cancer history did not alter the strength of association between NAT2 genotype class and oral cancer risk. However, additional adjustments for cigarette smoking and alcohol history resulted in a significant odds ratio (OR 1.76, 95%CI 1.21–2.55). Investigating 40 gene–environment pairs involving 8 genetic endpoints ( Table 3 ) and 5 measures of cigarette or alcohol use, we identified only 1 instance of possible gene–environment interaction. The association between oral cancer and CYP1A1 genotype (any * 2C or * 4 allele vs no * 2C or * 4 alleles) differed statistically ( p value = .03) according to 1 measure of cigarette use (never smokers: OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.43–3.47; smokers ?26 pack-years: OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08–0.91; smokers >26 pack-years: OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.74–2.87). In an analysis restricted to current or excigarette smokers, the association between oral cancer and cumulative cigarette dose exposure (>26 pack-years vs ?26 pack-years) differed statistically ( p value <.01) according to CYP1A1 genotype (any * 2C or * 4 allele: OR 10.7, 95% CI 2.8–40.6; no * 2C or * 4 alleles: OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.25–2.99). The search for gene–gene interaction entailed separate study of the 28 possible gene–gene pairs established by our 8 genetic endpoints ( Table 3 ). Analyses identified 2 statistically significant instances of interaction. The association between oral cancer and NAT2 acetylator status (fast vs slow) different statistically ( p value = .03) according to CYP1A1 genotype (any * 2C or * 4 allele: OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.24–1.53; no * 2C or * 4 alleles: OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.20–2.60). The association between oral cancer and GSTP1 genotype (no wild-type haplotypes vs at least 1 wild-type haplotype) differed statistically ( p value = .04) according to CYP2E1 genotype (any * 5B allele: OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01–4.24; no * 5B alleles: OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.83–1.52). A third gene–gene pair almost reached statistical significance. The association between oral cancer and NAT acetylator status (fast vs slow) differed with p value .051 according to MPO genotype (any 463A allele: OR 2.38, 95%CI 1.34–4.21; no 463A alleles: OR 1.16, 95%CI 0.74–1.80). Using the 4 SNPs usually used to infer acetylator status, 7.6% of 276 NAT2 fast acetylators and 58.8% of 311 NAT2 slow acetylators, according to the 13-SNP classification method, were reclassified as NAT2 slow and fast, respectively. Reclassifications were independent of case–control status ( p value >.05). The 4-SNP method increased the percentages regarded as being NAT2 fast (77.7% and 73.2% in the case and control groups, respectively). The NAT2-fast-oral-cancer association was statistically significant for cases and controls classified according to the 13-SNP method (crude OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.05–2.11), but not according to the 4-SNP method (crude OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.85–1.92).

DISCUSSION Comparing 203 cases and 416 controls for genetic variation relevant to the metabolism of tobacco-related carcinogens and alcohol, we observed an independent and statistically significant association between oral cancer and a class of NAT2 genotypes signifying fast acetylation (multiply adjusted OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.21–2.55). Case and control genotype frequencies were similar for 7 other metabolic enzyme genes, CYP1A1 , CYP2E1 , GSTM1 , GSTT1 , GSTP1 , MPO , and mEH ( Table 3 ). We are unaware of any prior single report of as many genetic variants in as large a population of white subjects with oral squamous cell carcinoma. As part of a funded oral cancer program, we excluded subjects with head and neck cancer at sites other than the oral cavity or oropharynx. This homogeneous case group, restricted to oral cancer, may have created conditions favorable to the identification of causally relevant genetic factors. We also restricted the case and control groups to persons who admitted smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol. This unique feature recognized not only the rarity of combined never drinking never smoking in oral cancer case series, but also the presumed action of our genetic endpoints through tobacco and alcohol. Studies of NAT2 and nonlaryngeal head and neck cancer are uncommon. 42 – 46 Two hospital-based studies, 1 French (121 oral/pharyngeal cancers, 164 controls) 42 and 1 Japanese (62 oral cancers, 122 controls), 43 observed moderate risk increases (OR 1.7- to 2-fold) with NAT2 slow acetylator genotypes. Though also reporting an association with NAT2 slow acetylator genotype, a second hospital-based Japanese study (145 head and neck cancer cases, 164 controls) included mostly cases of pharyngeal ( N = 43) or laryngeal cancer ( N = 69), with the risk association most apparent in the laryngeal cancer subgroup. 44 NAT2 genotype frequencies were nearly identical in oral cancer case ( N = 94) and control groups ( N = 92) from a German clinic-based study. 45 A U.S. population-based case–control study from the state of Washington (white subjects: 320 oral cancers, 520 controls), reported statistically nonsignificant inverse oral cancer risk associations with intermediate (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.5–1.5) and slow (OR 0.9, 95%CI 0.5–1.7) NAT2 genotype. 46 Studies investigating the modifying effects of NAT2 on tobacco or alcohol-related oral cancer risk aremore uncommon. The French study, mentioned above, observed a slow versus fast NAT2 -cancer association (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3–7.2) only in persons with a smoking history ?30 years in duration. 43 In the U.S. study, the alcohol-cancer association was stronger in nonslow (rapid or intermediate) than slowNAT2 acetylators. 46 However, we are unaware of any direct role for NAT2 in the metabolism of ethanol or acetaldehyde (a carcinogen produced by the action of aldehyde dehydrogenase on ethanol). Alcohol intake may alter the action of NAT2 variants on oral cancer risk through induction of other enzymes involved in tobacco carcinogen activation-detoxification. We observed a stronger association between oral cancer and cumulative cigarette dose exposure among persons with at least 1 variant CYP1A1 SNP (* 2C or * 4 ). However, we did not observe any similar interactions involving NAT acetylator status and measures of alcohol or cigarette use. In contrast to this report of an association between NAT2 fast acetylator status and increased oral cancer risk, studies of smoking-related cancer at other sites, such as bladder, esophagus, larynx, and lung, often suggest association in the opposite direction. Depending on inhalational as opposed to noninhalational route of exposure, variable contact with distinct tobacco-related carcinogens, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic amines, may explain results that differ according to cancer site. The highly polymorphic N-acetyltransferases both activate and inactivate many different chemicals that belong to distinct chemical classes. Therefore, the direction of effects from NAT2 differences and associated mechanisms of action may be difficult to predict for complex carcinogen mixtures. In addition, we classified cases and controls according to 13 NAT2 alleles, as opposed to the 4 or 5 most common alleles typically studied. As noted above, the 4-SNP and 13-SNP approaches classified subjects differently according to NAT2 acetylator status. In addition to possible interactions with ethnic mix, cigarette type, dose intensity, other smoking behaviors (eg, depth of inhalation), alcohol, or dietary intake, choice of genetic endpoint may contribute to variable results across studies or across cancer sites. Limitations of our study include restriction to a single (white) racial group and sample size, though larger than most other studies of oral cancer. We have not adjusted for HPV16 status, 1 of the major risk factors for pharyngeal cancer, however the genotype frequencies were statistically similar in oral cases versus oropharyngeal cases within this case group. As determinants of oral cancer risk, metabolic enzymes presumably act as members of pathways or networks. We observed 3 situations where genetic variation involving a Phase I enzyme affected the association between oral cancer and genetic variation involving a Phase II enzyme ( CYP1A1 and NAT2 , CYP2E1 and GSTP1 , and MPO and NAT2 ). However, confident study of gene-gene interactions of this nature requires much larger sample sizes. Finally, when examining a set of candidate genes, human geneticists debate the advantages and disadvantages of approaches based on study of phased haplotype, as opposed to genotype. Our approach stressed genetic risk factor classification schemes consistent with a current understanding of the biological properties of the genetic variants selected for study. Particularly for NAT2 , a gene showing extensive genetic variability in human populations, analyses based on empirically derived haplotypes, as opposed to genotype classes defined to represent biological differences, may or may not lead to similar conclusions. The tools available for the genetic dissection of complex traits have matured and whole genome association studies might provide new insights in the future.
