A Phase I Combination Study of Trabectedin and Doxorubicin in Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma Purpose To determine the dose of trabectedin plus doxorubicin with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) support associated with manageable neutropenia and acceptable dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in patients with recurrent or persistent soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Methods In this phase I, open-label, multicenter trial, patients previously treated with 0–1 prior chemotherapy regimens excluding doxorubicin, an ECOG performance status 0–1, and adequate organ function received a 10–15-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 immediately followed by a 3-hour IV infusion of trabectedin 0.9–1.3 mg/m2 on day 1 of a 3-week cycle. Because four of the first six patients experienced DLT-defining neutropenia during cycle 1, all subsequent patients received primary prophylactic G-CSF. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was the highest dose level with ?6 patients in which less than one third of the patients experienced severe neutropenia or DLT. Blood was collected during cycle 1 for pharmacokinetic analyses. Adverse events (AEs), tumor response, and survival were assessed. Results Patients (N = 41) received a median of six cycles of treatment (range, 2–13). The MTD was trabectedin 1.1 mg/m2 and doxorubicin 60 mg/m2. Common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent AEs were neutropenia (71%), ALT increase (46%), and thrombocytopenia (37%). Overall, five (12%) patients achieved a partial response, and 34 (83%) maintained stable disease. Median progression-free survival was 9.2 months. Doxorubicin and trabectedin pharmacokinetics were not altered substantially with concomitant administration. Conclusion The combination of doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 followed by trabectedin 1.1 mg/m2 every 21 days is safe and active in patients with STS.  INTRODUCTION Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a rare type of cancer that is difficult to treat. The established standard of care for unresectable STS is doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, with typical response rates of 10%–30% and only limited options for those who relapse or develop resistance ( 1 – 4 ). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rarely exceeds 6 months and 1 year, respectively. New management strategies should be developed ( 5 ). Trabectedin (YONDELIS®, ET-743; Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, Raritan, NJ; PharmaMar S.A.U., Madrid, Spain) is a tetrahydroisoquinolone alkaloid isolated from Ecteinascidia turbinata , a marine ascidian. Its complex mechanism involves binding to the minor groove of double-stranded DNA and subsequent bending of DNA toward the major groove ( 6 – 8 ), resulting in inhibition of gene activation and of nucleotide excision repair and in induction of DNA strand breaks and cell cycle arrest in S and G2 phases ( 9 – 12 ). In vitro, trabectedin has shown potent cytotoxic activity against a variety of cell lines, including human STS ( 13 , 14 ), and antitumor activity against a variety of human xenografts, including sarcomas ( 15 ). Moreover, there appears to be no cross-resistance between trabectedin and other chemotherapy ( 15 ). In clinical trials, single-agent trabectedin has shown activity in a variety of tumor types, including osteosarcoma, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer ( 16 – 27 ). The clinical activity of single-agent trabectedin has been demonstrated in heavily pretreated patients with advanced STS, with a median duration of response of approximately 9–12 months and 6-month PFS rates of 24%–29% ( 19 , 21 , 23 , 24 ). Trabectedin (1.5 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) was also evaluated in 35 chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced STS, with a clinical benefit rate of 20% and median duration of response of 16.5 months ( 25 ). It was recently approved in the European Union for patients with advanced STS after failure of anthracyclines or ifosfamide or for those who are unsuited to receive such agents. The cytotoxicity of trabectedin and doxorubicin was investigated in vitro in two STS cell lines, which showed a synergistic antitumor effect mediated via apoptosis in both cell lines ( 14 ). Further analysis in preclinical studies in human sarcoma–bearing mice suggested a synergistic effect ( 28 ). Prior unpublished phase I studies combining trabectedin and doxorubicin in patients with STS have also demonstrated increased efficacy, but with greater myelotoxicity in the absence of growth factor support. More recent results of a clinical trial evaluating trabectedin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in 30 heavily pretreated patients with advanced malignancies suggested it was well tolerated at nearly full single-agent doses. Further, the trial demonstrated a response rate of 20% and stable disease rate of 47% ( 29 ). Given the above results showing increased efficacy with trabectedin combined with doxorubin or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, but greater myelotoxicity, it was of interest to study the combination of trabectedin and doxorubicin in patients with advanced STS with hematopoietic growth factor support. The primary objective of this trial was to determine the doses of trabectedin and doxorubicin that could be safely delivered with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) support and with a clinically acceptable incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), including neutropenia, in patients with recurrent or persistent STS. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of trabectedin and doxorubicin.  Methods In this phase I, open-label, multicenter trial, patients previously treated with 0–1 prior chemotherapy regimens excluding doxorubicin, an ECOG performance status 0–1, and adequate organ function received a 10–15-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 immediately followed by a 3-hour IV infusion of trabectedin 0.9–1.3 mg/m2 on day 1 of a 3-week cycle. Because four of the first six patients experienced DLT-defining neutropenia during cycle 1, all subsequent patients received primary prophylactic G-CSF. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was the highest dose level with ?6 patients in which less than one third of the patients experienced severe neutropenia or DLT. Blood was collected during cycle 1 for pharmacokinetic analyses. Adverse events (AEs), tumor response, and survival were assessed.  Results Patients (N = 41) received a median of six cycles of treatment (range, 2–13). The MTD was trabectedin 1.1 mg/m2 and doxorubicin 60 mg/m2. Common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent AEs were neutropenia (71%), ALT increase (46%), and thrombocytopenia (37%). Overall, five (12%) patients achieved a partial response, and 34 (83%) maintained stable disease. Median progression-free survival was 9.2 months. Doxorubicin and trabectedin pharmacokinetics were not altered substantially with concomitant administration.  Conclusion The combination of doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 followed by trabectedin 1.1 mg/m2 every 21 days is safe and active in patients with STS.  METHODS Patients Patients were eligible if ?18 years with a diagnosis of STS (any histology, metastatic disease or recurrent/persistent disease after initial therapy), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–1, a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within normal limits, and adequate organ function. To continue treatment, patients had to meet the following criteria on day 1 of each cycle: platelets ?100,000/µL; ANC ?1500/µL; direct bilirubin ? upper limit of normal (ULN); transaminase elevation ? grade 2; and alkaline phosphatase elevation, other nonhematologic drug-related effects, and creatine phosphokinase elevation ? grade 1. Patients were excluded if they had received > 1 prior chemotherapy regimen (including adjuvant); were pregnant or lactating or planning to become pregnant during or for 1 year after therapy; had been exposed previously to anthracyclines or trabectedin; had received radiation therapy < 4 weeks from study entry or had radiotherapy to >20% of the bone marrow; or had known central nervous system metastasis. All patients provided written informed consent. Study Design This was a phase I, open-label study conducted at five sites (three in the United States; two in France). A patient who completed at least six cycles was considered to have completed the study. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the study centers, and the trial was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation/Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Sequential escalating doses of doxorubicin with trabectedin were tested as outlined in Table 1 ; dose level –1 was prespecified if dose level 1 was associated with an unacceptable rate of DLTs as described below. G-CSF was administered to all patients who experienced grade 4 neutropenia in cycle 1; these patients were given the option to receive secondary prophylactic G-CSF for subsequent cycles. If two or more of the first six patients experienced severe neutropenia during cycle 1, they were to be excluded from all future enrollment decisions and from determination of selected dose, and all subsequently enrolled patients were to receive primary prophylactic G-CSF (ie, G-CSF with the first cycle of chemotherapy). Dose escalation continued, provided that less than one third of patients at a dose level experienced severe neutropenia or other DLT. If more than one third but less than two thirds of patients experienced severe neutropenia or other DLT, three additional patients were enrolled at that same dose level. If two thirds or more of patients at a dose level experienced severe neutropenia or other DLT, the dose was considered unacceptable, and the next group of patients was enrolled at the next lower dose level. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the highest dose level with at least six patients enrolled and at which less than one third of patients experienced severe neutropenia or other DLT. Treatment Administration On day 1 of each cycle, all patients received an intravenous (IV) infusion of dexamethasone (20 mg). Within 1 hour of dexamethasone, doxorubicin was given IV over 10–15 minutes. Immediately after the doxorubicin infusion, trabectedin was given as a 3-hour IV infusion. If two or more of the first six patients experienced severe neutropenia during cycle 1, all subsequently enrolled patients would receive primary prophylactic G-CSF (filgrastim 5 µg/kg/d, day 3 for ?10 days or until absolute neutrophil count [ANC] >1000/µL after nadir or pegfilgrastim according to the manufacturer’s recommendations). In addition, patients received prophylactic and therapeutic antiemetics as needed. Other supportive care, including transfusions, hematopoietic growth factors, antibiotics, analgesics, and antidiarrheals, was permitted throughout the trial. Safety DLT was defined as any of the following: severe neutropenia, defined as grade 4 event lasting ?7 days despite G-CSF, grade 4 event of any duration with fever ?38.5°C, or event of any grade associated with sepsis or documented infection; platelets <25,000/µL; delay in therapy >3 weeks due to drug-related adverse events; or any grade 3/4 toxicity that was severe, unexpected, and deemed related to the combination (except nausea/vomiting despite appropriate antiemetic prophylaxis or grade 3/4 transaminitis lasting <7 days). ANC was monitored biweekly. Adverse events were recorded, and toxicity was graded using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0 (30). Doxorubicin therapy was discontinued if the LVEF decreased to <45%, or if other cardiac symptoms occurred. If ?6 cycles were administered (cumulative doxorubicin dose, 360 mg/m2), patients underwent a MUGA scan or 2-D echocardiogram that was repeated every two cycles thereafter, or they were permitted to discontinue doxorubicin. Patients who discontinued doxorubicin could continue receiving single-agent trabectedin 1.3 mg/m2. Response to Therapy and Survival Best overall response was determined by the investigator. Disease status was confirmed by repeated assessments at least every 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met, based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines ( 31 ). Survival data were collected during the follow-up phase (every 8 weeks for the first 2 years, and every 3 months thereafter). Pharmacokinetic Analysis Prior to dosing and at various times after dosing in cycle 1, whole blood samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis. Plasma trabectedin concentrations were measured by validated liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (validated concentration range, 0.025–2.5 ng/mL) at the Slotervaart Hospital (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in samples collected pre-dose and at 1 h 15 min, 3 h 5 min, 3 h 45 min, 5 h, 9 h, 24 h, 51 h, 75 h, 147 h, and 219 h. Plasma doxorubicin and doxorubicinol concentrations were measured by validated LC-MS/MS (validated concentration range for both, 1–500 ng/mL) at Pharma Bio-Research (Assen, The Netherlands) in samples collected predose and at 15 min, 1 h 15 min, 3 h 5 min, 3 h 45 min, 5 h, 9 h, 24 h, and 51 h. Pharmacokinetic parameters (maximum plasma concentration, Cmax; time to Cmax, tmax; terminal rate constant, ?z; terminal half-life, t½; area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC] from time 0 to the last quantifiable point, AUClast; AUC from time 0 to infinity, AUC?; systemic clearance, CL; and apparent volume of distribution at steady state, Vss) were estimated by noncompartmental methods. Statistical Analysis A maximum sample size of 58 was based on the assumption that up to 48 patients would be enrolled. The recommended combination dose was based on the DLT rate observed in cycle 1 only. Because this study was limited to patients with STS and only a few planned dose levels, a larger than usual sample size was planned for each dose level to better investigate the safety profile of the combination. The larger sample size for each dose level guaranteed a 95% confidence interval of the DLT rate at the MTD below 33%. All patients who received ? 1 dose of trabectedin were included in the safety analysis. Adverse events were summarized for each dose level and by severity. OS and PFS were summarized with Kaplan-Meier curves. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the plasma concentrations of trabectedin, doxorubicin, and doxorubicinol at each sampling time by dose level.  Patients Patients were eligible if ?18 years with a diagnosis of STS (any histology, metastatic disease or recurrent/persistent disease after initial therapy), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–1, a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within normal limits, and adequate organ function.

RESULTS Patient Population This study was conducted between June 2005 and August 2006, and 41 patients were enrolled. Each received ?1 dose of study medication and was included in the analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 2 . Men constituted approximately 63% of the population, and the median age was 56 years (range, 29–75). Most of the population (59%) had an ECOG performance status of 1, almost half (49%) had liposarcoma, and almost all (95%) had undergone previous surgery. Safety Patients received a median of six cycles of treatment (range, 2–13). Median duration of treatment was 18.1 weeks (range, 6–44), and median administered cumulative doses were trabectedin 5.39 mg/m2 (range, 1.9–13.7) and doxorubicin 350.0 mg/m2 (range, 88–543). Median cumulative dose intensity for trabectedin was 0.89 mg/m2 per 3 weeks (range, 0.5–1.3), and for doxorubicin 54.7 mg/m2 per 3 weeks (range, 25–60). At dose level 1, prior to the institution of prophylactic G-CSF, four of the first six patients experienced severe neutropenia during the first treatment cycle; this group is referred to as dose level 1A. Consequently, all subsequent patients, including four additional patients enrolled at level 1, received primary prophylactic G-CSF. No DLTs were observed at dose level 1; dose level 2 was truncated to 13 patients after no DLTs were observed. Two patients at dose level 3 experienced DLTs, which were grade 4 neutropenia (n = 1) and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (n = 2), making this dose level unacceptable. Dose modifications/reductions were required for trabectedin in 51% of patients and for doxorubicin in 27% of patients. Hyperbilirubinemia and thrombocytopenia were the most frequently occurring adverse events to lead to trabectedin dose reduction; thrombocytopenia was the most frequent event leading to doxorubicin dose reduction. Fifty one percent of all patients had to delay treatment for one or more cycles. Neutropenia was the most frequent reason for cycle delays. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (71%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase (46%), and thrombocytopenia (37%) ( Table 3 ). The most common drug-related adverse events of any severity were nausea (83%), neutropenia (80%), and alopecia (71%). One death occurred within 30 days of last dose at dose level 3 due to drug-related adverse events (acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute renal failure). Another death occurred approximately 7 months after last course at dose level 1 due to cardiac arrest, likely related to chest wall radiation–induced lung fibrosis; however, a causal relationship to study drug could not be positively excluded. Response to Therapy and Survival Best response to treatment is shown in Table 4 . Five patients achieved a partial response (three with liposarcoma including two myxoid type, one with leiomyosarcoma of unknown site of origin, and one with sarcomatoid carcinoma) and, of the 33 patients who maintained stable disease, 15 (37%) did so for ?6 months. Median PFS was 9.2 months ( Fig 1a ). Three-, 6-, and 12-month PFS rates were 85.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.3–93.1), 58.5% (95% CI, 42.0–71.8), and 43.8% (95% CI, 28.4–58.1), respectively. Median OS across all dose levels is shown in Figure 1b . Median OS for dose levels 1A, 1, and 2 had not been reached at clinical cutoff, with a median follow-up of 21 months; median OS for dose level 3 was 14.8 months. Pharmacokinetic Analysis The relatively small sample size and between-patient variability precluded comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters of trabectedin among dose levels; however, clinically relevant differences among mean values were not readily apparent. Pharmacokinetic parameters of trabectedin were similar to historical control values for single-agent trabectedin. An increase in mean Cmax and AUC? of doxorubicin was observed with increasing doses of trabectedin; however, minimal differences and no clear trend were observed when mean plasma concentrations at each time point from 1.25 hours to 51 hours were compared. Minimal differences in t½ values of doxorubicin were observed among dose levels. For doxorubicinol, an increase in mean Cmax was observed with increasing doses of trabectedin. Minimal differences and no clear trend were observed when mean plasma AUC? and t½ values were compared ( Table 5 ).

At dose level 1, prior to the institution of prophylactic G-CSF, four of the first six patients experienced severe neutropenia during the first treatment cycle; this group is referred to as dose level 1A. Consequently, all subsequent patients, including four additional patients enrolled at level 1, received primary prophylactic G-CSF. No DLTs were observed at dose level 1; dose level 2 was truncated to 13 patients after no DLTs were observed. Two patients at dose level 3 experienced DLTs, which were grade 4 neutropenia (n = 1) and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (n = 2), making this dose level unacceptable. Dose modifications/reductions were required for trabectedin in 51% of patients and for doxorubicin in 27% of patients. Hyperbilirubinemia and thrombocytopenia were the most frequently occurring adverse events to lead to trabectedin dose reduction; thrombocytopenia was the most frequent event leading to doxorubicin dose reduction. Fifty one percent of all patients had to delay treatment for one or more cycles. Neutropenia was the most frequent reason for cycle delays. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (71%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase (46%), and thrombocytopenia (37%) ( Table 3 ). The most common drug-related adverse events of any severity were nausea (83%), neutropenia (80%), and alopecia (71%). One death occurred within 30 days of last dose at dose level 3 due to drug-related adverse events (acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute renal failure). Another death occurred approximately 7 months after last course at dose level 1 due to cardiac arrest, likely related to chest wall radiation–induced lung fibrosis; however, a causal relationship to study drug could not be positively excluded.  Safety Patients received a median of six cycles of treatment (range, 2–13). Median duration of treatment was 18.1 weeks (range, 6–44), and median administered cumulative doses were trabectedin 5.39 mg/m2 (range, 1.9–13.7) and doxorubicin 350.0 mg/m2 (range, 88–543).

Response to Therapy and Survival Best response to treatment is shown in Table 4 . Five patients achieved a partial response (three with liposarcoma including two myxoid type, one with leiomyosarcoma of unknown site of origin, and one with sarcomatoid carcinoma) and, of the 33 patients who maintained stable disease, 15 (37%) did so for ?6 months. Median PFS was 9.2 months ( Fig 1a ). Three-, 6-, and 12-month PFS rates were 85.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.3–93.1), 58.5% (95% CI, 42.0–71.8), and 43.8% (95% CI, 28.4–58.1), respectively. Median OS across all dose levels is shown in Figure 1b . Median OS for dose levels 1A, 1, and 2 had not been reached at clinical cutoff, with a median follow-up of 21 months; median OS for dose level 3 was 14.8 months.

Pharmacokinetic Analysis The relatively small sample size and between-patient variability precluded comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters of trabectedin among dose levels; however, clinically relevant differences among mean values were not readily apparent. Pharmacokinetic parameters of trabectedin were similar to historical control values for single-agent trabectedin. An increase in mean Cmax and AUC? of doxorubicin was observed with increasing doses of trabectedin; however, minimal differences and no clear trend were observed when mean plasma concentrations at each time point from 1.25 hours to 51 hours were compared. Minimal differences in t½ values of doxorubicin were observed among dose levels. For doxorubicinol, an increase in mean Cmax was observed with increasing doses of trabectedin. Minimal differences and no clear trend were observed when mean plasma AUC? and t½ values were compared ( Table 5 ).

DISCUSSION This phase I, dose-finding trial of trabectedin and doxorubicin in patients with STS was prompted by evidence that the two agents were active as single agents in STS, had synergistic effects on STS cells in vitro ( 14 ), showed synergistic responses in STS preclinical studies ( 28 ), and demonstrated activity in patients with STS, although with myelotoxicity in the absence of growth factor support. Previously, it was determined that the recommended dose of single-agent trabectedin when given as a 24-hour infusion in 3-week cycles was 1.5 mg/m2 ( 16 ), and when given as a 3-hour infusion in 3-week cycles, 1.3 mg/m2 ( 26 , 32 , 33 ). A randomized phase II study using two different treatment schedules given every 3 weeks either over a 3-h or 24-h infusion has been explored ( 34 – 36 ). Safety and efficacy were not substantially different, although less myelosuppression was found with the 3-h infusion schedule. In addition, the dose intensity did not differ significantly between both schedules, and the 3-h regimen provided a greater convenience. Therefore, based on prior experience, the 3-h regimen was considered an appropriate schedule for combination regimens. Commonly used doses of single-agent doxorubicin when given in 3-week cycles are 60–75 mg/m2 ( 3 , 4 ). Because neutropenia was expected to be the most severe toxicity, we incorporated G-CSF treatment into the design as primary prophylaxis. We found that the MTD of trabectedin and doxorubicin given in 3-week cycles was trabectedin 1.1 mg/m2 plus doxorubicin 60 mg/m2. Thus, these data indicate that, with the proper usage of primary prophylactic G-CSF, trabectedin and doxorubicin can be combined at nearly full single-agent doses for the treatment of patients with recurrent or persistent STS. After institution of primary G-CSF prophylaxis, no DLTs were observed with doses up to trabectedin 1.1 mg/m2 plus doxorubicin 60 mg/m2. Doxorubicin and trabectedin pharmacokinetics were not altered substantially with concomitant administration, based on comparisons of trial results with results of previous studies in which each was given as a single agent. These findings are consistent with results from preclinical studies of combination administration of doxorubicin and trabectedin in human STS tumor–bearing animals ( 28 ). Although the primary goal of the study was not to measure response, findings of a partial response in 5/41 patients (12%) and stable disease in 34/41 patients (83%; 15 [37%] patients with stable disease ?6 months) showed the benefit of this combination in STS; a clinical benefit rate (partial response + stable disease ?6 months) of 49% was achieved. In addition, median PFS was 9.2 months, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month PFS rates far exceeded historical controls ( 37 ). Longer follow-up is required to determine median OS, as this had not been reached by clinical cutoff at most dose levels. Doxorubicin as a single agent or in combination with ifosfamide remains the preferred treatment option with consistent activity against advanced STS ( 38 ). Although the response rate remains relatively low, there is evidence of tumor control in ~50% of these patients. Actually, tumor control rate (TCR), which includes patients who achieve CR, PR, minor response or prolonged SD, seems more meaningful than the objective response (concept of tumor shrinkage) in assessing the benefit in sarcoma. General consensus is that PFS, TTP and OS are the more appropriate measures of efficacy in metastatic STS ( 37 , 39 ). This is most likely due to less shrinkage of the tumor mass due to the heavy involvement of connective tissue, even when there is effective eradication of malignant cells ( 38 ). Although the addition of trabectedin did not appear to increase doxorubicin objective response rate, the TCR achieved was 49%, with a median PFS of 9.2 months, that far exceeds historical controls. In addition, certain histological subtypes of STS, especially myxoid liposarcoma, might be particularly sensitive ( 38 ). The preliminary efficacy results reported herein complement those observed with single-agent trabectedin in patients with heavily pretreated ( 19 , 21 , 23 , 24 ) and chemotherapy-naive advanced STS ( 25 ) and further support the role of trabectedin in the treatment of STS. Of the three liposarcomas where partial responses were observed, two were myxoid which are known to be responsive to trabectedin, contributing to the efficacy seen in this trial ( 38 ). In addition, leiomysosarcomas of uterine origin are usually more responsive than those of other primary sites. However, the site of origin for one patient with leiomyosarcoma who had a partial response could not be confirmed. Finally, atypical lipomatous tumors have long PFS in the absence of response regardless of treatment, but this was not the diagnosis of any patients treated in this trial. In conclusion, in patients with recurrent or persistent STS, the combination of trabectedin and doxorubicin with primary prophylactic G-CSF support is safe, generally well tolerated, and shows antitumor activity. The MTD and recommended phase II dose of trabectedin is 1.1 mg/m2 with doxorubicin 60 mg/m2, both administered every 3 weeks. Because this combination may fulfill the need for a more active regimen to treat patients with STS, further investigation is warranted.
