Deconstructing feedback-signaling networks to improve anticancer therapy with mTORC1 inhibitors Targeting mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which regulates general protein translation, represents one of the most attractive approaches to treating cancer, since up-regulation of this pathway is a common hallmark in many tumors. Nevertheless, the use of rapamycin and its analogs in the clinic has revealed that mTORC1 pathway is embedded in a network of signaling cross-talks and feedbacks which might reduce its effectiveness in cancer. We have recently described a novel signaling feedback stemming from mTORC1 inhibition, which leads to the activation of ERK-MAPK (MAPK) pathway. The observation that MAPK is activated by rapamycin and its analogs in vitro , in mouse models, and cancer patient biopsies sets the rationale for the combined use of MAPK and mTORC1 inhibitors in cancer therapy. In this extra-view, we integrate our findings into the mTORC1 signaling network and discuss its relevance for the design of combinatorial therapies with mTORC1 inhibitors.
