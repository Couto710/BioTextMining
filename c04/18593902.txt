15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase is a target of HNF3? and a tumor suppressor in lung cancer The forkhead transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor 3? (HNF3?), is essential in foregut development and the regulation of lung-specific genes. HNF3? expression leads to growth arrest and apoptosis in lung cancer cells and HNF3? is a candidate tumor suppressor in lung cancer. In a transcriptional profiling study utilizing a conditional cell line system we now identify 15-PGDH as one of the major genes induced by HNF3? expression. 15-PGDH is a critical metabolic enzyme of proliferative prostaglandins, an antagonist to COX-2 and a tumor suppressor in colon cancer. We confirmed the regulation of 15-PGDH expression by HNF3? in a number of systems and showed direct binding of HNF3? to 15-PGDH promoter elements. Western blotting of lung cancer cell lines and immunohistochemical examination of human lung cancer tissues found loss of 15-PGDH expression in about 65% of lung cancers. Further studies using in vitro cell-based assays and in vivo xenograft tumorigenesis assays demonstrated lack of in vitro but significant in vivo tumor suppressor activity of 15-PGDH via an anti-angiogenic mechanism analogous to its role in colon cancer. In summary, we identify 15-PGDH as a direct downstream effector of HNF3? and demonstrate that 15-PGDH acts as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer.  INTRODUCTION Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths within the United States, despite recent advances in its treatment ( 1 ). The minimal progress achieved in the treatment of this disease calls for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to the development and maintenance of this malignancy ( 2 , 3 ). We and others demonstrated the important role of the tissue-specific differentiation factor, C/EBP?, as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer ( 4 - 7 ). We also identified hepatocyte nuclear factor 3? (HNF3?) as a downstream effector of C/EBP? and a candidate tumor suppressor in lung cancers ( 8 ). HNF3?, also named Foxa2, belongs to the forkhead family of transcription factors and is essential in foregut development and in the regulation of several lung-specific genes ( 9 ). To gain additional insights into the downstream effects of HNF3? expression, we performed a microarray study on an HNF3? -inducible lung adenocarcinoma cell line and defined transcriptional changes secondary to conditional expression of HNF3?. This study identified the Cox-2 antagonist enzyme, 15-PGDH as one of the most highly induced downstream targets of HNF3? in lung cancer cells and we show direct regulation of the 15-PGDH promoter by HNF3?. Further, we demonstrate significant downregulation of 15-PGDH expression in a tissue subtype-dependent manner in non-small cell lung cancer. We also show that 15-PGDH expression leads to strong in vivo tumor suppressive effects via an anti-angiogenic mechanism analogous to its function in colon cancer model systems. Our findings suggest that 15-PGDH is a downstream effector of HNF3? with in vivo tumor suppressive effects in NSCLC.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Lines and Cell Culture The following lung cancer cell lines, all from ATCC, were used in this study: Calu-1, SK-MES-1, SW900, SK-LU-1, H23, H441, H358, A549, H322, H125, H292, H460, Calu-6, H69 and H211. Cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The HNF3?-inducible stable cell line H358-HNF3? (tet-off)) was generated previously from H358 lung cancer cells ( 8 ). H358-HNF3? (tet-off) cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% doxycycline-free fetal bovine serum and 1?g/ml of doxycycline. HNF3? expression can be induced by doxycycline withdrawal from the culture medium. Oligonucleotide Array Analysis Triplicate plates of H358-HNF3? (tet-off) cells were maintained in doxycycline-free RPMI 1640 for 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the TRIzol method and was then processed and hybridized to Affymetrix Hu-133 microarrays and scanned. The expression value was calculated by application to the Affymetrix ‘.CEL’ files of the RMA procedure as implemented in Bioconductor ( 10 , 11 ). Quantitative RT-PCR assay Total RNAs were collected using TRIzol from H358-HNF3? (tet-off) cells with or without the deprivation of doxycycline from culture medium. cDNAs were synthesized with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (SuperScipt™ III reverse transcriptase) with the use of oligo(dT) primers from Invitrogen (All primer sequences are listed in Suppl. methods). All samples were run in triplicate on Roche LightCycler using the Syber green probes (Roche) by the following variables: denaturation at 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of amplification (95°C 10 seconds, 60°C 10 seconds, and 72°C 15 seconds), and cooled to 40°C at a transition rate of 20°C per second. Levels of GAPDH expression were used as internal reference to normalize input cDNA. Ratios of level of each gene to GAPDH were then calculated. Immunoblotting Whole cell lysates were isolated using RIPA buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences) and 20 ?g of protein/lane were electrophoresed in 10% SDS/PAGE minigels. 1:1,000 dilution of polyclonal goat anti-HNF3? antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), 1:1,000 dilution of monoclonal mouse anti-15-PGDH antibody 13, 1:1,000 polyclonal rabbit PARP antibody (Cell Signaling), and 1:500 monoclonal mouse ?-actin antibody (Sigma) were used. Detection was performed using Western Lightning™ Chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Luciferase Reporter Assay H358-HNF3? (tet-off) cells were grown in RPMI 1640/10% FBS containing 1 ?g/ml doxycycline. Duplicate samples of 1×105 cells in 6-well plates were transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche) with 50 ng of phRL-CMV-Renilla luciferase plus one of the following plasmids: 0.5 ?g of pcDNA3-pp5.9-Firefly luciferase, 0.5 ?g of pcDNA3-pp2.2-firefly luciferase, or 0.5 ?g of pcDNA3 empty vector. Cells were then deprived of doxycycline 24 hours post transfection and cultured for additional 0, 24, 48, 72, or 96 hours. Cell extracts were prepared and luciferase assays were done on a luminometer (LMax II 384, Molecular Devices) by using the Dual Luciferase-Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to parallel Renilla luciferase activities to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. ChIP Assay H358-HNF3? (tet-off) cells were cultured in doxycycline-free medium for 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. 1 × 108 cells were cross-linked by 0.37% formaldehyde. Nuclear extracts were prepared (20% of each nuclear extract was saved before immmunoprecipitation as input chromatin DNA) and immunoprecipitated by 5 ?g of goat polyclonal HNF3?antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4°C for 6 h with rotation. Immune complexes were collected by incubating with protein A-agarose beads overnight at 4°C with rotation. Cross-links of the immunoprecipitated samples and input samples were reversed by heating at 65°C in the presence of NaCl and RNase A (Sigma) for 5 hours followed by proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics) digestion. Binding of HNF3? to the 15-PGDH promoter was assessed by PCR and quantitative PCR with primer sets amplifying two HNF3?-binding-sequence-containing regions spanning bps -3793 ? -3778 and bps -446 ? -430 of the 15-PGDH promoter, respectively ( 12 , 13 ). These promoter regions were identified as putative HNF3?-binding regions by the use of MatInspector Software. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) Nuclear extracts were collected from H358-HNF3? (tet-off) cells cultured in doxycycline-free medium for 0 or 96 hours. dsDNA annealing was achieved by incubating complementary pairs of oligonucleotides at 95°C for 5 minutes followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Binding reactions were performed using PIERCE LightShift® ChemiluminescentEMSA Kit with 2 ?g of nuclear extract and 20 fmol of biotin-labeled dsDNA. 4 pmol of unlabeled oligonucleotides were used in the competition assays. The ENBA control system was used as experimental controls (PIERCE).The mixture was analyzed by 6% DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen) in 0.5×TBE buffer (Invitrogen), transferred to a positively-charged nylon membrane, UV cross-linked, and detected by chemiluminescence. The gel-separated DNA-protein complex was also transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for HNF3? immunoblotting. MTS Cell Growth Assay H358 lung cancer cells were transfected with pcDNA6-empty vector (pcDNA6-EV), or expression vectors encoding wild-type (pcDNA6-WT-PGDH) or mutant (pcDNA6-Mu-PGDH) 15-PGDH by using Fugene 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. MTS cell growth assays were performed 48, 72 and 96 hours after transfection according the manufacturer’s instructions Annexin/Propidium Iodide Apoptosis Assay H358 cells were collected by trypsinization 72 hours after transfection, and then washed with PBS, and stained with annexin/propidium iodide according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Applied Science). Samples were analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell scan cytometer EPICS® XL MCL coulter. Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemical staining was accomplished using the R.T.U. Vectastain Universal Quick Kit (Vector Lab) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with the use of anti-HNF3? (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA , 1:500 dilution), anti-15-PGDH (1:500 dilution) 13 or anti-VEGF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, 1:500 dilution. Transient transfection Calu-1 and SKLU-1 lung cancer cells were transfected with pcDNA3 (+)-ratHNF3? using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Whole cell lysates collected 0, 24, 48, 72, or 96 hours after transfection were used in immunoblotting for HNF3? and 15-PGDH. H358 cells were transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche). Whole cell lysates were collected 72 hours post transfection. 15-PGDH Stable Transfection and Tumorigenesis Assay H358 lung cancer cells were transfected with pcDNA6-empty vector (pcDNA6-EV), or expression vectors encoding wild-type 15-PGDH (pcDNA6-Wt-PGDH) by using Fugene 6 (Roche). Stable cell pools were selected by growing cells in regular culture medium containing 10 ?g/ml of blasticidin. Cells at 70-80% confluency were trypsinized and washed three times with serum-free RPMI 1640. 5 × 106 cells resuspended in 200 ?l of serum-free medium were injected subcutaneously behind the anterior forelimb of a 5-week-old BALB/c athymic mouse. Tumor diameters were measured weekly with a caliper and the tumor volume in mm3 was calculated by the formula: Volume = (width)2 × length/2. The mean volumes of xenograft tumors were obtained from 10 replicate injections. PGE2 ELISA H358 stable cells expressing 15-PGDH and H358 empty vector control cells were seeded in a 12-well plate at a 1 × 105 cells/well density. Culture medium was collected 72 hours later and centrifuged briefly to remove cell debris. The PGE2 levels were examined by ELISA according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Perkin Elmer). The optical density at 405 nm and 590 nm was read immediately on a microplate autoreader (BIO-TEK Instruments Inc. EL311). Each reading of OD 405 nm was normalized by the reading of OD 590 nm and the concentration of PGE2 from each sample were calculated according the standard curve generated from the PGE2 standards provided. Determination of microvessel density (MVD) Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and immunohistochemically stained with rat anti-mouse CD31 monoclonal antibody (Clone MEC 13.3, 1:10 dilution; Pharmingen). The MVD of the xenograft tissue sections was evaluated at high power field (400×). The mean microvessel count of the five most vascular areas was calculated as MVD for each section. The mean MVD from three animals in the wild type 15-PGDH and empty vector control groups was obtained as the final MVD count. Determination of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) Concentration of the angiogenic growth factor VEGF was measured from H358 cell culture medium (in triplicate) at 72 hours. Measurement was performed with the ELISA kits for VEGF 165 (catalog number DVE00, R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Endothelial cell proliferation assay A total of 4 × 103 cells in 100?L of basal medium with 1% FBS were seeded into each well of a 96-well plate, treated with 10% of the appropriate conditioned medium as the stimulant, and incubated at 37°C for 72 hours; control cells were incubated in basal medium and 1% FBS, as above ( 14 ). No additional proliferation stimulus (VEGF or bFGF) was added. After the 72-hour incubation, WST-1 (10 ?L) was added to each well, and after a 3 hour incubation at 37°C, absorbance at 450nm was determined for each well with a microplate reader (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). The data presented are the average of triplicate experiments. Matrigel Tube Formation Assay Each well of a pre-chilled 48-well cell culture plates was coated with 100?L of unpolymerized Matrigel (7?g/mL) and incubated at 37°C for 30-45 minutes ( 15 ). HUVECs were harvested with trypsin, and 4 × 104 cells were resuspended in 300?L endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum, and treated with 10% of the appropriate conditioned medium before plating onto the Matrigel-coated plates. After 12 hours of incubation at 37°C, endothelial cell tube formation was assessed with an inverted photomicroscope (Nikon, Melville, NY). Microphotographs of the center of each well at low power were taken at 40X magnification with the aid of imaging-capture software (NIS-Elements from Nikon, Melville, NY). Tube formation in the microphotographs was quantitatively analyzed (total tube length); controls consisted of HUVECs in basal medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. The experiment was done in triplicate and the data presented represent the average of triplicate experiments. Statistical analysis Spearman correlation coefficient was used to estimate the association between two continuous measurements; and the association between two factors was examined by Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. The difference of a continuous measurement between two groups was examined by Student’s T-test. All tests were two-sided and a p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS Transcriptional profiling study identifies downstream changes upon HNF3? induction We performed a transcriptional profiling study utilizing our previously generated inducible H358-HNF3? (tet-off) stable cell lines ( 8 ). These clonally derived cell lines strongly and reproducibly can be induced to express HNF3? upon withdrawal of doxycycline from the medium. Two separate clones (clones 6108/4 and 6108/31) were induced by doxycycline withdrawal from the culture medium for 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. Triplicate specimens were collected for each timepoint and total cellular RNA was prepared with the use of Trizol and hybridized to Affymetrix Hu-133 arrays after cRNA generation from each triplicate specimen individually. Following appropriate processing and filtering, the microarray data on the triplicate samples were analyzed through the use of Affymetrix GeneChip software separately for each timepoint. A preliminary clustering analysis of the data suggested that the control and 24-hours specimens clustered separately from the 48, 72 and 96-hour samples. This suggested that the HNF3?-induced signature becomes prominent after 24 hours. This finding was not surprising since in this system HNF3? induction on the protein level is not observed until 24-48 hours of doxycycline withdrawal. Therefore, given the clustering analysis results we carried out comparative marker selection by grouping the samples into a 0+24h class and a 48+72+96h class, and then comparing the relative expression between the two groups. Genes were ranked according to a two-group t-statistic, permutation-based p values were computed, and the FDR procedure was used to correct for multiple hypothesis testing ( 16 , 17 ). Marker genes with an FDR value < 0.01 and at least 2-fold difference in expression levels between the two groups were selected as the group of HNF3?-regulated genes (Tables 1 - 2 in Supplemental Data ). HNF3? increases 15-PGDH expression in lung cancer cells Among the genes induced by HNF3?, 15-PGDH was identified as over-expressed by four GeneChip probe sets with an approximate 3-fold increase. 15-PGDH is a metabolic enzyme of proliferative prostaglandins and through that an important antagonistic enzyme to Cox-2 ( 18 ). Given the important role of prostaglandin metabolism and Cox-2 in cancer, including lung cancer ( 19 , 20 ), we focused our further studies on the delineation of 15-PGDH regulation by HNF3?. H358-HNF3? (tet-off) cells were maintained in the absence of doxycycline for up to 144 hours. Total RNAs were then collected for real-time RT-PCR. We observed an up-regulation of 15-PGDH mRNA as early as 12 hours after doxycyline withdrawal. The mRNA level peaked at 72 hours to a degree of 10-fold for clone 4 and at 96 hours to a degree of 15-fold for clone 31 ( Figure 1A and Suppl. Figure 1 ). Three other genes induced by HNF3?, including early growth response 4 (EGR4), complement component 5 (C5), and proteoglycan 1 (PRG1) were also confirmed by quantitative PCR ( Figure 1B ). A significant increase of 15-PGDH protein was also found 24 hours after doxycycline withdrawal, reaching its peak level at 48 hours while starting to diminish at 72 hours ( Figure 1C ). Transient transfection of HNF3? using squamous carcinoma Calu-1 cells and adenocarcinoma SKLU-1 cells (both with very weak expression of HNF3? and 15-PGDH) showed that HNF3? protein was induced at 24 hours after transfection and its level peaked at 48 hours in both cell lines; as expected with a transient transfection experiment, at 96 hours the expression decreased dramatically in Calu-1 cells whereas was totally absent in SKLU-1 ( Figure 1D ). The expression of 15-PGDH became apparent at 48 hours after transfection and decreased in correlation with HNF3? expression in both cell lines ( Figure 1D ). These data suggest that 15-PGDH expression is increased by HNF3? in a dose-dependent manner in human lung cancer cells and that 15-PGDH could be a potential downstream target of HNF3?’s tumor suppressor activity. HNF3? regulates 15-PGDH by direct binding to and modulation of the 15-PGDH promoter To further determine the mechanism of how HNF3? regulates the expression of 15-PGDH, we compared the promoter activity of the 15-PGDH gene in the presence or absence of HNF3?. The promoter region of the 15-PGDH gene has been carefully mapped out previously( 12 , 21 ). Two Firefly luciferase reporter constructs were used for transfection: pcDNA3(+)-pp5.9-Firefly luciferase (pp5.9), where the expression of luciferase is driven by a fragment of 5.9 kb upstream of the start codon of 15-PGDH (GeneBank accession number: AF177983, NT_022792)( 22 ) and pcDNA3(+)-pp2.2-Firefly luciferase (pp2.2), where the luciferase expression is driven by a fragment of the 15-PGDH promoter containing base pairs from bp -1 ? -2233. phRL-CMV-Renilla luciferase reporter was used to normalize transfection efficiency. Promoter activity with either construct increased 24 hours after HNF3? induction with a 3-fold and a 7-fold change for pp2.2 and pp5.9 and the activity peaked at 96 hours with an 8- and 12-fold change for pp2.2 and pp5.9, respectively ( Figure 2A ). This suggested that the 15-PGDH promoter indeed is regulated by HNF3? and that there might be more than one regulation site for HNF3? that act synergistically. The human 15-PGDH gene promoter contains two potential binding sites for the HNF3? transcription factor: bp -3793 ? -3778 and bp -446 ? -430 (MatInspector, Figure 2B ). ChIP assays were performed to assess physical binding of HNF3? to these putative promoter elements. H358-HNF3? (tet-off) cells were used and HNF3? expression was induced. Protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked, DNA was fragmented and nuclear extracts were prepared at different time points upon HNF3? induction and immunoprecipitation was then performed with an HNF3?-specific antibody. The expression level of HNF3? was increased 24 hours after induction as shown by the input control ( Figure 2C ). The amount of immunoprecipitated HNF3? followed the same pattern as that of HNF3? expression ( Figure 2C ). By using PCR, we detected in the precipitates the presence of both hypothesized 15-PGDH promoter elements ( Figure 2C ), indicating the direct binding of HNF3?. Moreover, we observed that the level of these two promoter sequences increased along with the amount of HNF3? precipitated ( Figure 2D ). EMSA assays further confirmed the interaction between the HNF3? and 15-PGDH promoter ( Figure 3A & B ). While no binding using nuclear extracts collected from uninduced cells, strong binding was observed using nuclear extracts obtained after 96 hours of induction. This binding activity could be competed away by the use of complementary cold oligonucleotides but not by the use of oligonucleotides with mutations in the predicted HNF3?-binding site. Lastly, Western blotting demonstrated specific HNF3? activity on transferred DNA-protein complexes further confirming specificity. 15-PGDH is down-regulated in human lung cancer cells and human lung tumors and its expression correlates with HNF3? expression We previously observed the loss of HNF3? in more than 50% of human lung cancer cell lines ( 8 ). Since the expression of 15-PGDH is regulated by HNF3?, we decided to investigate the expression of 15-PGDH in human lung cancers. We found lack of 15-PGDH expression in 11 of 16 (69%) lung cancer cell lines ( Figure 4A ). A positive correlation between 15-PGDH and HNF3? expression was found to be significant (p < 0.05) ( Figure 4A ). Then, 78 paraffin-embedded, primary non-small cell lung tumors obtained from patients undergoing resection were stained by immunohistochemistry. 15-PGDH was strongly expressed in the nuclei of type I pneumocytes in normal lung tissues while no expression was found in either type II pneumocytes or bronchial epithelia ( Figure 4B ). We set up a scoring system similar to our previously reported scoring system for C/EBP? ( 4 ). The expression of 15-PGDH was undetectable or very weak (0-1+) in 49 out of 78 (63%) samples examined and there was a significant association between 15-PGDH expression and tumor histology (p = 0.006): 55.3% patients with adenocarcinoma had 15-PGDH positive tumors as compared to only 12.5% patients with squamous carcinoma. This might potentially reflect the cellular origin of these tumors with squamous cell cancers typically originating from more proximal airways (bronchial epithelium) where 15-PGDH is not normally expressed versus adenocarcinomas originating from more peripheral (bronchiolar or alveolar) epithelium. We also completed an immunohistochemical study for HNF3? expression using 59 of the same tumor slides and found a significant association between HNF3? and 15-PGDH expression (p=0.043, khi-square analysis). 24% of the HNF3?-negative tumors while 50% of the HNF3?-positive tumors were 15-PGDH positive ( Figure 4C ). Tumor suppressor activity of 15-PGDH in lung cancer Loss of 15-PGDH expression found in human lung cancer cells and lung tumor tissues and the regulation of 15-PGDH by the tumor suppressor HNF3? both suggest that 15-PGDH might have tumor suppressor activity in lung cancer similar to its role in other malignancies. To test this hypothesis, we first conducted in vitro assays using transient transfection of human 15-PGDH in H358 cells. H358 cells were transfected with pcDNA6 empty vector (EV), pcDNA6-Mu-PGDH (Mu) encoding an enzyme dead 15-PGDH mutant (Y151L and K155E)( 23 ) or pcDNA6-WT-PGDH (WT) encoding WT 15-PGDH. Whole cell lysates were collected 72 hours later and used in immunoblotting. Fragmentation of PARP (85 kD) was undetectable in any of the three groups of transfected cells and the level of the intact caspase substrate in cells expressing WT 15-PGDH was similar to that of empty vector control cells or cells expressing the 15-PGDH mutant ( Suppl. Figure 2A ). MTS cell growth assay performed 48, 72, and 96 hours after transfection also showed no difference between the three groups (p > 0.05, Suppl. Figure 2B ). The percentage of apoptotic cells detected by Annexin/PI staining was also indistinguishable between WT 15-PGDH-expressing cells and control cells ( Suppl. Figure 2C ). These in vitro data demonstrate no cell-autonomous growth effect of 15-PGDH on lung cancer cells. We then used stable transfection to reconstitute 15-PGDH expression in H358 lung cancer cells to test 15-PGDH function in vivo . H358 cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding WT 15-PGDH, or with a control empty expression vector. Expression of 15-PGDH was confirmed by immunoblotting of stable pools ( Figure 5A ). Similar MTS cell growth assays and Annexin/PI apoptosis flow cytometry were also performed on H358-PGDH stable cells and no significant difference was found between EV control cells and cells that express 15-PGDH ( Figure 5B ). The PGE2 level in the culture medium of 15-PGDH-expressing H358-PGDH-WT cells was significantly lower than that of empty vector control cells (p < 0.001, Figure 5C ), confirming the negative regulation of PGE2 levels by 15-PGDH. Next, we performed a xenograft study by injecting groups of five athymic mice with H358-PGDH-WT cells or control H358-EV cells (two injections per mice). 15-PGDH markedly suppressed tumor formation in vivo : tumors arising from 15-PGDH expressing cells were significantly and on average by 50% smaller than those from control cells ( Figure 5D ). These findings of an inhibitory role of 15-PGDH in in vivo tumorigenic growth, but not in in vitro cultured cells, are consistent with what has been found in colon cancers, suggesting a possible cell heterologous mechanism of 15-PGDH function, where 15-PGDH prevents cell growth by lowering PGE2 level and thus inhibiting angiogenesis as opposed to directly affecting cellular growth ( 13 ). To test this, we compared the microvessel densities between xenografts derived from 15-PGDH expressing H358 cells and those from control H358 cells (H358-EV), and found significantly reduced microvessel density in tumor tissues with 15-PGDH overexpression ( Figure 6A ). At 400× microscopic magnification, the mean ± SD of microvessel density was 2.87 ± 0.70 for xenograft tumors with 15-PGDH overexpression compared to 4.80 ± 0.35 for xenografts without 15-PGDH overexpression (p < 0.05, Figure 6B ). Since PGE2 levels are believed to mediate their angiogenic effect through modulation of VEGF expression via EP receptor activation( 24 ), we decided to test VEGF levels from conditioned medium collected from H358-WT-PGDH cells and indeed found that VEGF levels were 25% less than that from H358-EV cells (p < 0.01, Figure 6C ). Next, we performed immunohistochemistry on xenografted tumors to assess the in vivo changes in VEGF expression. These studies showed a significant decrease of VEGF expression in 15-PGDH expressing WT H358 cells ( Figure 6A ). Last, we performed endothelial proliferation and functional assays (Matrigel tube formation assay) using conditioned medium obtained from H358-WT and H358-EV cells ( Figure 6D ). While no significant difference was seen on endothelial cell proliferation, H358-WT conditioned medium significantly reduced endothelial cell function consistent with a paracrine effect of 15-PGDH expressing lung cancer cells on endothelial cell function, likely by PGE2-mediated reduction in VEGF levels.  RESULTS Transcriptional profiling study identifies downstream changes upon HNF3? induction We performed a transcriptional profiling study utilizing our previously generated inducible H358-HNF3? (tet-off) stable cell lines ( 8 ). These clonally derived cell lines strongly and reproducibly can be induced to express HNF3? upon withdrawal of doxycycline from the medium. Two separate clones (clones 6108/4 and 6108/31) were induced by doxycycline withdrawal from the culture medium for 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. Triplicate specimens were collected for each timepoint and total cellular RNA was prepared with the use of Trizol and hybridized to Affymetrix Hu-133 arrays after cRNA generation from each triplicate specimen individually. Following appropriate processing and filtering, the microarray data on the triplicate samples were analyzed through the use of Affymetrix GeneChip software separately for each timepoint. A preliminary clustering analysis of the data suggested that the control and 24-hours specimens clustered separately from the 48, 72 and 96-hour samples. This suggested that the HNF3?-induced signature becomes prominent after 24 hours. This finding was not surprising since in this system HNF3? induction on the protein level is not observed until 24-48 hours of doxycycline withdrawal. Therefore, given the clustering analysis results we carried out comparative marker selection by grouping the samples into a 0+24h class and a 48+72+96h class, and then comparing the relative expression between the two groups. Genes were ranked according to a two-group t-statistic, permutation-based p values were computed, and the FDR procedure was used to correct for multiple hypothesis testing ( 16 , 17 ). Marker genes with an FDR value < 0.01 and at least 2-fold difference in expression levels between the two groups were selected as the group of HNF3?-regulated genes (Tables 1 - 2 in Supplemental Data ). HNF3? increases 15-PGDH expression in lung cancer cells Among the genes induced by HNF3?, 15-PGDH was identified as over-expressed by four GeneChip probe sets with an approximate 3-fold increase. 15-PGDH is a metabolic enzyme of proliferative prostaglandins and through that an important antagonistic enzyme to Cox-2 ( 18 ). Given the important role of prostaglandin metabolism and Cox-2 in cancer, including lung cancer ( 19 , 20 ), we focused our further studies on the delineation of 15-PGDH regulation by HNF3?. H358-HNF3? (tet-off) cells were maintained in the absence of doxycycline for up to 144 hours. Total RNAs were then collected for real-time RT-PCR. We observed an up-regulation of 15-PGDH mRNA as early as 12 hours after doxycyline withdrawal. The mRNA level peaked at 72 hours to a degree of 10-fold for clone 4 and at 96 hours to a degree of 15-fold for clone 31 ( Figure 1A and Suppl. Figure 1 ). Three other genes induced by HNF3?, including early growth response 4 (EGR4), complement component 5 (C5), and proteoglycan 1 (PRG1) were also confirmed by quantitative PCR ( Figure 1B ). A significant increase of 15-PGDH protein was also found 24 hours after doxycycline withdrawal, reaching its peak level at 48 hours while starting to diminish at 72 hours ( Figure 1C ). Transient transfection of HNF3? using squamous carcinoma Calu-1 cells and adenocarcinoma SKLU-1 cells (both with very weak expression of HNF3? and 15-PGDH) showed that HNF3? protein was induced at 24 hours after transfection and its level peaked at 48 hours in both cell lines; as expected with a transient transfection experiment, at 96 hours the expression decreased dramatically in Calu-1 cells whereas was totally absent in SKLU-1 ( Figure 1D ). The expression of 15-PGDH became apparent at 48 hours after transfection and decreased in correlation with HNF3? expression in both cell lines ( Figure 1D ). These data suggest that 15-PGDH expression is increased by HNF3? in a dose-dependent manner in human lung cancer cells and that 15-PGDH could be a potential downstream target of HNF3?’s tumor suppressor activity. HNF3? regulates 15-PGDH by direct binding to and modulation of the 15-PGDH promoter To further determine the mechanism of how HNF3? regulates the expression of 15-PGDH, we compared the promoter activity of the 15-PGDH gene in the presence or absence of HNF3?. The promoter region of the 15-PGDH gene has been carefully mapped out previously( 12 , 21 ). Two Firefly luciferase reporter constructs were used for transfection: pcDNA3(+)-pp5.9-Firefly luciferase (pp5.9), where the expression of luciferase is driven by a fragment of 5.9 kb upstream of the start codon of 15-PGDH (GeneBank accession number: AF177983, NT_022792)( 22 ) and pcDNA3(+)-pp2.2-Firefly luciferase (pp2.2), where the luciferase expression is driven by a fragment of the 15-PGDH promoter containing base pairs from bp -1 ? -2233. phRL-CMV-Renilla luciferase reporter was used to normalize transfection efficiency. Promoter activity with either construct increased 24 hours after HNF3? induction with a 3-fold and a 7-fold change for pp2.2 and pp5.9 and the activity peaked at 96 hours with an 8- and 12-fold change for pp2.2 and pp5.9, respectively ( Figure 2A ). This suggested that the 15-PGDH promoter indeed is regulated by HNF3? and that there might be more than one regulation site for HNF3? that act synergistically. The human 15-PGDH gene promoter contains two potential binding sites for the HNF3? transcription factor: bp -3793 ? -3778 and bp -446 ? -430 (MatInspector, Figure 2B ).

Moreover, we observed that the level of these two promoter sequences increased along with the amount of HNF3? precipitated ( Figure 2D ). EMSA assays further confirmed the interaction between the HNF3? and 15-PGDH promoter ( Figure 3A & B ). While no binding using nuclear extracts collected from uninduced cells, strong binding was observed using nuclear extracts obtained after 96 hours of induction. This binding activity could be competed away by the use of complementary cold oligonucleotides but not by the use of oligonucleotides with mutations in the predicted HNF3?-binding site.

Tumor suppressor activity of 15-PGDH in lung cancer Loss of 15-PGDH expression found in human lung cancer cells and lung tumor tissues and the regulation of 15-PGDH by the tumor suppressor HNF3? both suggest that 15-PGDH might have tumor suppressor activity in lung cancer similar to its role in other malignancies.

The percentage of apoptotic cells detected by Annexin/PI staining was also indistinguishable between WT 15-PGDH-expressing cells and control cells ( Suppl. Figure 2C ). These in vitro data demonstrate no cell-autonomous growth effect of 15-PGDH on lung cancer cells. We then used stable transfection to reconstitute 15-PGDH expression in H358 lung cancer cells to test 15-PGDH function in vivo . H358 cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding WT 15-PGDH, or with a control empty expression vector. Expression of 15-PGDH was confirmed by immunoblotting of stable pools ( Figure 5A ). Similar MTS cell growth assays and Annexin/PI apoptosis flow cytometry were also performed on H358-PGDH stable cells and no significant difference was found between EV control cells and cells that express 15-PGDH ( Figure 5B ). The PGE2 level in the culture medium of 15-PGDH-expressing H358-PGDH-WT cells was significantly lower than that of empty vector control cells (p < 0.001, Figure 5C ), confirming the negative regulation of PGE2 levels by 15-PGDH.

Transcriptional profiling study identifies downstream changes upon HNF3? induction We performed a transcriptional profiling study utilizing our previously generated inducible H358-HNF3? (tet-off) stable cell lines ( 8 ). These clonally derived cell lines strongly and reproducibly can be induced to express HNF3? upon withdrawal of doxycycline from the medium.

We observed an up-regulation of 15-PGDH mRNA as early as 12 hours after doxycyline withdrawal. The mRNA level peaked at 72 hours to a degree of 10-fold for clone 4 and at 96 hours to a degree of 15-fold for clone 31 ( Figure 1A and Suppl. Figure 1 ). Three other genes induced by HNF3?, including early growth response 4 (EGR4), complement component 5 (C5), and proteoglycan 1 (PRG1) were also confirmed by quantitative PCR ( Figure 1B ). A significant increase of 15-PGDH protein was also found 24 hours after doxycycline withdrawal, reaching its peak level at 48 hours while starting to diminish at 72 hours ( Figure 1C ). Transient transfection of HNF3? using squamous carcinoma Calu-1 cells and adenocarcinoma SKLU-1 cells (both with very weak expression of HNF3? and 15-PGDH) showed that HNF3? protein was induced at 24 hours after transfection and its level peaked at 48 hours in both cell lines; as expected with a transient transfection experiment, at 96 hours the expression decreased dramatically in Calu-1 cells whereas was totally absent in SKLU-1 ( Figure 1D ).

HNF3? regulates 15-PGDH by direct binding to and modulation of the 15-PGDH promoter To further determine the mechanism of how HNF3? regulates the expression of 15-PGDH, we compared the promoter activity of the 15-PGDH gene in the presence or absence of HNF3?. The promoter region of the 15-PGDH gene has been carefully mapped out previously( 12 , 21 ). Two Firefly luciferase reporter constructs were used for transfection: pcDNA3(+)-pp5.9-Firefly luciferase (pp5.9), where the expression of luciferase is driven by a fragment of 5.9 kb upstream of the start codon of 15-PGDH (GeneBank accession number: AF177983, NT_022792)( 22 ) and pcDNA3(+)-pp2.2-Firefly luciferase (pp2.2), where the luciferase expression is driven by a fragment of the 15-PGDH promoter containing base pairs from bp -1 ? -2233. phRL-CMV-Renilla luciferase reporter was used to normalize transfection efficiency. Promoter activity with either construct increased 24 hours after HNF3? induction with a 3-fold and a 7-fold change for pp2.2 and pp5.9 and the activity peaked at 96 hours with an 8- and 12-fold change for pp2.2 and pp5.9, respectively ( Figure 2A ). This suggested that the 15-PGDH promoter indeed is regulated by HNF3? and that there might be more than one regulation site for HNF3? that act synergistically. The human 15-PGDH gene promoter contains two potential binding sites for the HNF3? transcription factor: bp -3793 ? -3778 and bp -446 ? -430 (MatInspector, Figure 2B ). ChIP assays were performed to assess physical binding of HNF3? to these putative promoter elements. H358-HNF3? (tet-off) cells were used and HNF3? expression was induced. Protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked, DNA was fragmented and nuclear extracts were prepared at different time points upon HNF3? induction and immunoprecipitation was then performed with an HNF3?-specific antibody. The expression level of HNF3? was increased 24 hours after induction as shown by the input control ( Figure 2C ). The amount of immunoprecipitated HNF3? followed the same pattern as that of HNF3? expression ( Figure 2C ). By using PCR, we detected in the precipitates the presence of both hypothesized 15-PGDH promoter elements ( Figure 2C ), indicating the direct binding of HNF3?. Moreover, we observed that the level of these two promoter sequences increased along with the amount of HNF3? precipitated ( Figure 2D ). EMSA assays further confirmed the interaction between the HNF3? and 15-PGDH promoter ( Figure 3A & B ). While no binding using nuclear extracts collected from uninduced cells, strong binding was observed using nuclear extracts obtained after 96 hours of induction. This binding activity could be competed away by the use of complementary cold oligonucleotides but not by the use of oligonucleotides with mutations in the predicted HNF3?-binding site. Lastly, Western blotting demonstrated specific HNF3? activity on transferred DNA-protein complexes further confirming specificity.  HNF3? regulates 15-PGDH by direct binding to and modulation of the 15-PGDH promoter To further determine the mechanism of how HNF3? regulates the expression of 15-PGDH, we compared the promoter activity of the 15-PGDH gene in the presence or absence of HNF3?.

This suggested that the 15-PGDH promoter indeed is regulated by HNF3? and that there might be more than one regulation site for HNF3? that act synergistically. The human 15-PGDH gene promoter contains two potential binding sites for the HNF3? transcription factor: bp -3793 ? -3778 and bp -446 ? -430 (MatInspector, Figure 2B ).

This binding activity could be competed away by the use of complementary cold oligonucleotides but not by the use of oligonucleotides with mutations in the predicted HNF3?-binding site. Lastly, Western blotting demonstrated specific HNF3? activity on transferred DNA-protein complexes further confirming specificity.  15-PGDH is down-regulated in human lung cancer cells and human lung tumors and its expression correlates with HNF3? expression We previously observed the loss of HNF3? in more than 50% of human lung cancer cell lines ( 8 ). Since the expression of 15-PGDH is regulated by HNF3?, we decided to investigate the expression of 15-PGDH in human lung cancers. We found lack of 15-PGDH expression in 11 of 16 (69%) lung cancer cell lines ( Figure 4A ). A positive correlation between 15-PGDH and HNF3? expression was found to be significant (p < 0.05) ( Figure 4A ). Then, 78 paraffin-embedded, primary non-small cell lung tumors obtained from patients undergoing resection were stained by immunohistochemistry. 15-PGDH was strongly expressed in the nuclei of type I pneumocytes in normal lung tissues while no expression was found in either type II pneumocytes or bronchial epithelia ( Figure 4B ). We set up a scoring system similar to our previously reported scoring system for C/EBP? ( 4 ). The expression of 15-PGDH was undetectable or very weak (0-1+) in 49 out of 78 (63%) samples examined and there was a significant association between 15-PGDH expression and tumor histology (p = 0.006): 55.3% patients with adenocarcinoma had 15-PGDH positive tumors as compared to only 12.5% patients with squamous carcinoma. This might potentially reflect the cellular origin of these tumors with squamous cell cancers typically originating from more proximal airways (bronchial epithelium) where 15-PGDH is not normally expressed versus adenocarcinomas originating from more peripheral (bronchiolar or alveolar) epithelium. We also completed an immunohistochemical study for HNF3? expression using 59 of the same tumor slides and found a significant association between HNF3? and 15-PGDH expression (p=0.043, khi-square analysis). 24% of the HNF3?-negative tumors while 50% of the HNF3?-positive tumors were 15-PGDH positive ( Figure 4C ).  15-PGDH is down-regulated in human lung cancer cells and human lung tumors and its expression correlates with HNF3? expression We previously observed the loss of HNF3? in more than 50% of human lung cancer cell lines ( 8 ).

Tumor suppressor activity of 15-PGDH in lung cancer Loss of 15-PGDH expression found in human lung cancer cells and lung tumor tissues and the regulation of 15-PGDH by the tumor suppressor HNF3? both suggest that 15-PGDH might have tumor suppressor activity in lung cancer similar to its role in other malignancies. To test this hypothesis, we first conducted in vitro assays using transient transfection of human 15-PGDH in H358 cells. H358 cells were transfected with pcDNA6 empty vector (EV), pcDNA6-Mu-PGDH (Mu) encoding an enzyme dead 15-PGDH mutant (Y151L and K155E)( 23 ) or pcDNA6-WT-PGDH (WT) encoding WT 15-PGDH. Whole cell lysates were collected 72 hours later and used in immunoblotting. Fragmentation of PARP (85 kD) was undetectable in any of the three groups of transfected cells and the level of the intact caspase substrate in cells expressing WT 15-PGDH was similar to that of empty vector control cells or cells expressing the 15-PGDH mutant ( Suppl. Figure 2A ). MTS cell growth assay performed 48, 72, and 96 hours after transfection also showed no difference between the three groups (p > 0.05, Suppl. Figure 2B ). The percentage of apoptotic cells detected by Annexin/PI staining was also indistinguishable between WT 15-PGDH-expressing cells and control cells ( Suppl. Figure 2C ). These in vitro data demonstrate no cell-autonomous growth effect of 15-PGDH on lung cancer cells. We then used stable transfection to reconstitute 15-PGDH expression in H358 lung cancer cells to test 15-PGDH function in vivo . H358 cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding WT 15-PGDH, or with a control empty expression vector. Expression of 15-PGDH was confirmed by immunoblotting of stable pools ( Figure 5A ). Similar MTS cell growth assays and Annexin/PI apoptosis flow cytometry were also performed on H358-PGDH stable cells and no significant difference was found between EV control cells and cells that express 15-PGDH ( Figure 5B ). The PGE2 level in the culture medium of 15-PGDH-expressing H358-PGDH-WT cells was significantly lower than that of empty vector control cells (p < 0.001, Figure 5C ), confirming the negative regulation of PGE2 levels by 15-PGDH. Next, we performed a xenograft study by injecting groups of five athymic mice with H358-PGDH-WT cells or control H358-EV cells (two injections per mice). 15-PGDH markedly suppressed tumor formation in vivo : tumors arising from 15-PGDH expressing cells were significantly and on average by 50% smaller than those from control cells ( Figure 5D ). These findings of an inhibitory role of 15-PGDH in in vivo tumorigenic growth, but not in in vitro cultured cells, are consistent with what has been found in colon cancers, suggesting a possible cell heterologous mechanism of 15-PGDH function, where 15-PGDH prevents cell growth by lowering PGE2 level and thus inhibiting angiogenesis as opposed to directly affecting cellular growth ( 13 ). To test this, we compared the microvessel densities between xenografts derived from 15-PGDH expressing H358 cells and those from control H358 cells (H358-EV), and found significantly reduced microvessel density in tumor tissues with 15-PGDH overexpression ( Figure 6A ). At 400× microscopic magnification, the mean ± SD of microvessel density was 2.87 ± 0.70 for xenograft tumors with 15-PGDH overexpression compared to 4.80 ± 0.35 for xenografts without 15-PGDH overexpression (p < 0.05, Figure 6B ). Since PGE2 levels are believed to mediate their angiogenic effect through modulation of VEGF expression via EP receptor activation( 24 ), we decided to test VEGF levels from conditioned medium collected from H358-WT-PGDH cells and indeed found that VEGF levels were 25% less than that from H358-EV cells (p < 0.01, Figure 6C ). Next, we performed immunohistochemistry on xenografted tumors to assess the in vivo changes in VEGF expression. These studies showed a significant decrease of VEGF expression in 15-PGDH expressing WT H358 cells ( Figure 6A ). Last, we performed endothelial proliferation and functional assays (Matrigel tube formation assay) using conditioned medium obtained from H358-WT and H358-EV cells ( Figure 6D ). While no significant difference was seen on endothelial cell proliferation, H358-WT conditioned medium significantly reduced endothelial cell function consistent with a paracrine effect of 15-PGDH expressing lung cancer cells on endothelial cell function, likely by PGE2-mediated reduction in VEGF levels.  Tumor suppressor activity of 15-PGDH in lung cancer Loss of 15-PGDH expression found in human lung cancer cells and lung tumor tissues and the regulation of 15-PGDH by the tumor suppressor HNF3? both suggest that 15-PGDH might have tumor suppressor activity in lung cancer similar to its role in other malignancies.

Next, we performed immunohistochemistry on xenografted tumors to assess the in vivo changes in VEGF expression.

DISCUSSION Our studies demonstrate that 15-PGDH is a direct target and a downstream effector enzyme of the candidate tumor suppressor, HNF3? in lung cancer cells. The loss of 15-PGDH expression correlates with histological subtype in non-small cell lung cancer specimens. Our studies also reveal potent in vivo tumor suppressive properties of 15-PGDH in lung cancer cells mediated by an anti-angiogenic mechanism. The 15-PGDH gene is located on chromosome 4q34-35 and encodes a 29 kD protein that is active as a homodimer. Via NAD+-dependent oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl group of prostaglandins and lipoxins 15-PGDH is a key enzyme responsible for their biological inactivation ( 18 ). The enzyme is widely distributed in various mammalian tissues among which the lung is one of the most active tissues and genetic deletion of 15-PGDH leads to increased tissue levels of PGE2. We previously demonstrated that the forkhead transcription factor, HNF3? acts as a candidate tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer and here we demonstrate that 15-PGDH is one of the most highly induced genes by HNF3?. Although it remains to be determined as to what extent the tumor suppressing activity of HNF3? is mediated by 15-PGDH, our data clearly show that 15-PGDH expression is directly regulated by HNF3? in human lung cancer cells and also demonstrate in vivo growth suppressive properties of 15-PGDH per se via an anti-angiogenic mechanism, likely mediated by the reduction of PGE2 levels and as a consequence, regulation of VEGF expression. Our studies therefore identify 15-PGDH as a candidate tumor suppressor in human lung cancers. Despite its ubiquitous expression in normal alveolar epithelium, 15-PGDH is lost in 69% of human lung cancer cell lines and 63% of human lung tumor tissues, which strongly suggests a connection between the lack of 15-PGDH expression and tumor development/progression. The fact that the absence of 15-PGDH is more commonly observed in squamous carcinoma (87.5%) than in adenocarcinoma (44.7%) may indicate potentially cell type-specific tumor suppressive mechanisms and could be of significant utility in both diagnosis and choosing therapeutic strategies. Whether the lack of 15-PGDH expression observed indeed is of functional relevance will need to be ultimately determined by in vivo genetic studies utilizing 15-PGDH knockout mice as previously done in colon cancer ( 25 ). Similar to our data others have noted downregulation of 15-PGDH in lung tumors ( 26 , 27 ). One major limitation of both sets of data is the use of bulk RNA and protein derived from resected specimens not allowing a valid evaluation of its distribution, in particular considering the mix of tissue types a lung specimen is made up of. The immunohistochemical method developed by us allows more detailed mapping of 15-PGDH expression. We also explored the mechanism of how 15-PGDH could be a potential tumor suppressor by both in vitro cell growth assays and in vivo tumorigenic experiments. We observe no in vitro effect of 15-PGDH overexpression on growth or apoptosis in H358 lung cancer cells while find that 15-PGDH expression markedly reduces tumor formation in a xenograft model suggestive of a cell-heterologous manner in 15-PGDH tumor suppressor activity where 15-PGDH prevents tumor growth by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, analogous to its functional role in colon cancer ( 13 ). Overexpression of 15-PGDH in H358 lung cancer cells with modest endogenous 15-PGDH expression further decreases the level of secreted PGE2. While the observed reduction in PGE2 levels was modest, similar changes in PGE2 levels in other studies were demonstrated to be of functional significance. For example, in a study of Cox-2 knockout mice, PGE2 levels in the mammary gland were approximately 20% reduced in heterozygous versus wild-type animals and this change was associated with a significant reduction in tumor multiplicity ( 28 ). This finding was further corroborated by our in vitro and in vivo findings of reduced VEGF expression. Furthermore, our microvessel density analysis of mouse xenograft tissues and in vitro endothelial cell function studies support the role of 15-PGDH expression in reducing tumor angiogenesis via modulation of PGE2 and secondarily VEGF levels, although it cannot be excluded that some of its effects are at least in part mediated by some alternative mechanisms. Since 15-PGDH is the rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing the degradation of PGE2 synthesized by COX2 and acts as a physiological negative regulator of prostaglandin levels, its important functional role in cancers is not surprising ( 18 , 29 ). The suppression by 15-PGDH of in vivo tumorigenic growth but not of growth in cell culture, is consistent with suggestions from several models that the tumor-promoting effect of increased prostaglandin synthesis is principally mediated via increased tumor angiogenesis ( 30 , 31 ). While there was a strong correlation noted between HNF3? and 15-PGDH expression, still a fair number of PGDH-negative tumors do express HNF3? suggestive of alternative mechanisms for 15-PGDH silencing. The 15-PGDH promoter contains a CpG island in the region -163 to +140 relative to the start ATG codon and promoter methylation of the 15-PGDH promoter has been previously ntoed in breast and prostate cancer ( 32 , 33 ). These suggest that promoter methylation is a potential mechanism for the deregulation of 15-PGDH in non-small cell lung cancer and should lead to further investigation of the methylation of the 15-PGDH promoter. The chromosomal locus of 15-PGDH, 4q34-35 was found to be one of the most commonly lost regions in the genome-wide allelotyping study of Girard et al suggestive of an important unidentified tumor suppressor at this locus ( 34 ). Our results suggest that the 15-PGDH gene might be a prime candidate for such. Thus, 15-PGDH is a tumor suppressor whose activity is increased by HNF3?-regulated expression. We postulate that the loss of 15-PGDH activity could provide a mechanism for tumor progression and drug resistance. It has been demonstrated that 15-PGDH expression can be restored in certain colon cancer cell lines either by restoring TGF? signaling or by inhibiting EGFR signaling ( 13 , 28 ) and a recent study also demonstrated the regulation of 15-PGDH in lung cancer cells by EGF signaling ( 26 ). It is also intriguing that Wolfrum et al recently demonstrated that the activation of PI3kinase-AKT by insulin induced Foxa2 phosphorylation, nuclear exclusion and thereby inhibition of Foxa2-dependent transcriptional activity in liver cells potentially suggestive of the existence of an EGFR-AKT-Foxa2 pathway modulating 15-PGDH activity in lung cancer cells ( 35 ). These findings suggest several potential ways of modulating 15-PGDH expression and activity, and raise the possibility of 15-PGDH as a potential target in developing lung cancer therapy. Modulation of prostaglandin metabolism, in particular through the use of Cox-2 inhibitors has been an area of active investigation in cancer research over the last few years ( 19 , 36 ). While the tumor suppressive and preventative effects of Cox-2 inhibition appear valid, their use is associated with increased thromboembolic phenomena limiting their clinical utility. The prothrombotic effects of Cox-2 inhibition are felt to be at least in part mediated by PGI2. Since 15-PGDH does not alter the levels of the rapidly hydrolysable, anti-thrombotic prostaglandin PGI2, its modulation might avoid some of the cardiovascular side effects associated with Cox-2 inhibition and lead to treatment options with a better risk-benefit profile.

The chromosomal locus of 15-PGDH, 4q34-35 was found to be one of the most commonly lost regions in the genome-wide allelotyping study of Girard et al suggestive of an important unidentified tumor suppressor at this locus ( 34 ). Our results suggest that the 15-PGDH gene might be a prime candidate for such. Thus, 15-PGDH is a tumor suppressor whose activity is increased by HNF3?-regulated expression. We postulate that the loss of 15-PGDH activity could provide a mechanism for tumor progression and drug resistance. It has been demonstrated that 15-PGDH expression can be restored in certain colon cancer cell lines either by restoring TGF? signaling or by inhibiting EGFR signaling ( 13 , 28 ) and a recent study also demonstrated the regulation of 15-PGDH in lung cancer cells by EGF signaling ( 26 ). It is also intriguing that Wolfrum et al recently demonstrated that the activation of PI3kinase-AKT by insulin induced Foxa2 phosphorylation, nuclear exclusion and thereby inhibition of Foxa2-dependent transcriptional activity in liver cells potentially suggestive of the existence of an EGFR-AKT-Foxa2 pathway modulating 15-PGDH activity in lung cancer cells ( 35 ). These findings suggest several potential ways of modulating 15-PGDH expression and activity, and raise the possibility of 15-PGDH as a potential target in developing lung cancer therapy. Modulation of prostaglandin metabolism, in particular through the use of Cox-2 inhibitors has been an area of active investigation in cancer research over the last few years ( 19 , 36 ). While the tumor suppressive and preventative effects of Cox-2 inhibition appear valid, their use is associated with increased thromboembolic phenomena limiting their clinical utility. The prothrombotic effects of Cox-2 inhibition are felt to be at least in part mediated by PGI2. Since 15-PGDH does not alter the levels of the rapidly hydrolysable, anti-thrombotic prostaglandin PGI2, its modulation might avoid some of the cardiovascular side effects associated with Cox-2 inhibition and lead to treatment options with a better risk-benefit profile.
