Mendelian Randomization: How It Can—and Cannot—Help Confirm Causal Relations between Nutrition and Cancer Observational epidemiologic studies of nutrition and cancer have faced formidable methodologic obstacles, including dietary measurement error and confounding. We consider whether Mendelian randomization can help surmount these obstacles. The Mendelian randomization strategy, building on both the accuracy of genotyping and the random assortment of alleles at meiosis, involves searching for an association between a nutritional exposure-mimicking gene variant (a type of “instrumental variable”) and cancer outcome. Necessary assumptions are that the gene is independent of cancer, given the exposure, and also independent of potential confounders. An allelic variant can serve as a proxy for diet and other nutritional factors through its effects on either metabolic processes or consumption behavior. Such a genetic proxy is measured with little error and usually is not confounded by nongenetic characteristics. Examples of potentially informative genes include LCT (lactase), ALDH2 (aldehyde dehydrogenase), and HFE (hemochromatosis), proxies, respectively, for dairy product intake, alcoholic beverage drinking, and serum iron levels. We show that use of these and other genes in Mendelian randomization studies of nutrition and cancer may be more complicated than previously recognized and discuss factors that can invalidate the instrumental variable assumptions or cloud the interpretation of these studies. Sample size requirements for Mendelian randomization studies of nutrition and cancer are shown to be potentially daunting; strong genetic proxies for exposure are necessary to make such studies feasible. We conclude that Mendelian randomization is not universally applicable, but, under the right conditions, can complement evidence for causal associations from conventional epidemiologic studies.  Conclusion The promise of finding foods and other nutrition-related factors that are clearly causally related to cancer at various sites—offering possibilities of both primary and secondary prevention—remains tantalizing. Large-scale observational epidemiologic studies of diet and cancer are a critical tool in diet-and-cancer research, but methodologic difficulties, notably confounding, as a result of the clustering of behavioral, demographic, and physiologic characteristics, and dietary measurement error, hamper progress in these investigations. The Mendelian randomization strategy, by which genes reflecting altered dietary exposure are examined for association with cancer, can, with some serious caveats, help to overcome these methodologic difficulties and provide evidence to complement the findings from traditional observational studies. Suppose that similar nutrition-cancer associations emerge from both conventional epidemiologic investigations and Mendelian randomization studies. For that association not to be causal, one would have to argue (rather unconvincingly) that the nutritional exposure-cancer findings from the conventional epidemiologic study are confounded at the same time that the gene-cancer findings are biased by one of the Mendelian randomization limitations discussed earlier. Mendelian randomization is hardly a panacea. This strategy will neither substitute for continued efforts to improve dietary assessment in epidemiologic studies nor replace the randomized clinical trial with its avoidance of confounding. However, it is not yet established that we will get much better at assessing diet in observational studies or that incorporating new instruments will make a qualitative difference, although there is promise in this regard ( 83 ). Nor can clinical trials ethically or feasibly address all questions, leaving aside the expense and logistical complexity of such undertakings. In the end, it is the totality of evidence in the nutrition and cancer field that will lead to clear understanding and effective prevention. Under the right conditions, including especially the availability of a genetic instrument that is both strongly associated with the nutritional exposure and (given the exposure) independent of cancer outcome, Mendelian randomization can contribute to that totality.  Figures and Tables Fig. 1 A directed acyclic graph depicting how the instrumental variables approach is used in Mendelian randomization. Specifically, Z is the genotype, X is a nutritional exposure, Y is cancer outcome, and C , which is associated with both X and Y , is a potential confounder of an observed association between X and Y . A key assumption underlying the use of instrumental variables in the Mendelian randomization setting is that the association between genotype ( Z ) and cancer ( Y ) exists only because the genotype is associated with the nutritional exposure ( X ); that is, Z is independent of outcome Y given X . This is indicated by the dotted line from Z to Y .

We assume a random sample of R cases and S unrelated controls. The disease outcome is denoted by Y , with Y = 1 for diseased and Y = 0 for healthy subjects. The nutritional exposure is given by X, and we assume that the probability of disease in the population follows the model P ( Y = 1 | X ) = exp [ ? + ? X ] 1 + exp [ ? + ? X ] Instead of X , we assess the association of Y with a biallelic marker, with genotypes aa, aA , and AA . We define random variable M = 0, 1, 2, which corresponds to the number of A alleles in the marker genotype. Let Z ( M = i ) = Z i be a score associated with marker genotype M = i , for i = 0, 1, 2, with Z 0 = 0, Z 1 = k , and Z 2 = 1. For a dominant genetic model k = 1, for a recessive genetic model k = 0, and for an additive genetic model k = 1/2. The case-control data can then be summarized in a 2 × 3 table, where the columns correspond to genotype, M , and the rows to disease status, Y ; see Table 1 . The score test for testing for a trend in proportions is U = Z ? [(1 – ?) r – ? s ], where ? = R/N is the proportion of cases in the case-control study, and N = R + S . The vector of scores is Z ? = ( Z 0, Z 1, Z 2), and the genotype counts for cases and controls, r ? = ( r 0, r 1, r 2), and s ? = ( s 0, s 1, s 2) follow independent multinomial distributions with indices R and S and respective probabilities p ? = ( p 0, p 1, p 2) and q ? = ( q 0, q 1, q 2), where p i = P ( M = i | Y = 1) and q i = Pi ( M = i | Y = 0). Alternatively, U can be written as (A) U = ? i = 0 2 Z i N [ S r i ? R s i ] The variance of U is V = var( U ) = (1 – ?)2 RZ ? ? p Z + ?2 SZ ?? q Z , where ? p denotes the correlation matrix for the genotype counts for the cases with (? p ) ii = p i (1 - p i ) and (? ik ) = - p ip k , and ? q is defined analogously for the controls. Under the null hypothesis, H 0, that p i = q i , i = 0, 1, 2, a valid estimate of V is the pooled variance estimate, obtained by using ? p = ? q = ? with estimates p? = q? = n /N, where n = ( n 0, n 1, n 2) is the vector of total counts in Table 1 .

( z 1 ? ? / 2 ? * / ? 1 ? N E H 1 U / ? 1 ) + ? ( ? z 1 ? ? / 2 ? * / ? 1 ? N E H 1 U / ? 1 ) where ? stands for the standard normal distribution function and z1 ? ? = ??1 (1 ? ?).

If M has no effect on the probability of disease given X , that is P ( Y = 1| X , M ) = P ( Y = 1| X ), and assuming that that the joint distribution of the marker, M , and the nutritional exposure, X, f ( M,X ), is known, the probabilities are (C) p i = P ( M = i | Y = 1 ) = P ( M = i , Y = 1 ) P ( Y = 1 ) = ? x P ( Y = 1 | X = x ) d F ( M = i , x ) ? x P ( Y = 1 | X = x ) d F ( x ) , i = 0 , 1 , 2 When the exposure X is discrete, the integral is replaced by a sum. The calculations for the q i ?s for the controls are analogous, with P ( Y = 1| X ) replaced by (1 ? P ( Y = 1| X )). The power and sample size for the score test for trend therefore depend on the allele frequencies at the marker, the effect size for the true exposure, and, through the joint distribution of X and M , the amount of correlation between the nutritional exposure, X , and the gene used in the study.
