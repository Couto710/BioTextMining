Radiohalogenated Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)-Based Ureas as Imaging Agents for Prostate Cancer To extend our development of new imaging agents targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), we have used the versatile intermediate 2-[3-(5-amino-1-carboxy-pentyl)-ureido]-pentanedioic acid (Lys-C(O)-Glu), which allows ready incorporation of radiohalogens for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). We prepared 2-[3-[1-carboxy-5-(4-[125I]iodo-benzoylamino)-pentyl]-ureido]-pentanedioic acid ([125I] 3 ), 2-[3-[1-carboxy-5-(4-[18F]fluoro-benzoylamino)-pentyl]-ureido]-pentanedioic acid ([18F] 6 ) and 2-(3-[1-carboxy-5-[(5-[125I]iodo-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl]-ureido)-pentanedioic acid ([125I] 8 ) in 65 - 80% (non-decay-corrected), 30 - 35% (decay corrected) and 59 - 75% (non-decay-corrected) radiochemical yields. Compound [125I] 3 demonstrated 8.8 ± 4.7 percent injected dose per gram (%ID/g) within PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor at 30 min postinjection, which persisted, with clear delineation of the tumor by SPECT. Similar tumor uptake values at early time points were demonstrated for [18F] 6 (using PET) and [125I] 8 . Because of the many radiohalogenated moieties that can be attached via the ? amino group, the intermediate Lys-C(O)-Glu is an attractive template upon which to develop new imaging agents for prostate cancer.  Introduction Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men 1 . Localization of tumor as well as determination of the total body burden of PCa have important implications for therapy, particularly as new combination and focal therapies become available. Also critically needed are targeted agents that can provide a readout on the biology of the tumor, with the ability to predict which will lie dormant and which will develop into aggressive, metastatic disease. The current clinical standard for localizing cancer - including PCa - is shifting from the anatomic techniques of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to more physiologically relevant methods that employ molecular imaging, such as MR spectroscopy 2 , single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) 3 , 4 . Those newer methods, which utilize molecular imaging, may provide the biological readout necessary for understanding tumor physiology, enabling more accurate prognosis and therapeutic monitoring. Because of the relatively low metabolism of PCa, PET with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) has proved ineffectual in this disease. Other promising, experimental radiopharmaceuticals for imaging PCa are emerging, including those of the choline series 5 - 9 , radiolabeled acetates 10 , anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutyl-1-carboxylic acid (anti[18F]F-FACBC) 11 , 12 , 1-(2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-L-arabinofuranosyl)-5-methyluracil ([18F]FMAU) 13 and [18F]fluorodihydrotestosterone ([18F]FDHT) 14 . Each has its benefits and detriments, with no single agent ideal, i.e., easy to synthesize, little metabolism and demonstrating tumor-specific uptake, in all PCa phenotypes. Overexpressed on most solid tumor neovasculature 15 as well as in prostate cancer, the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is becoming an attractive target for cancer imaging and therapy 16 , 17 . ProstaScint™ is an 111In-labeled monoclonal antibody against PSMA that is clinically available for imaging PCa 18 . ProstaScint™ and radiolabeled variations of this antibody are fraught with long circulation times and poor target to nontarget tissue contrast, limiting the utility of these agents 19 - 21 . Previously we reported the synthesis of several low molecular weight, urea-based PSMA inhibitors for imaging PCa. Those compounds include N -[ N -[( S )-1,3-dicarboxypropyl]carbamoyl]-( S )-[11C]methyl-L-cysteine ([11C]DCMC) 22 , N -[ N -[( S )-1,3-dicarboxypropyl]carbamoyl]-( S )-3-[125I]iodo-L-tyrosine ([125I]DCIT) 23 , N -[ N -[( S )-1,3-dicarboxypropyl]carbamoyl]-( S )-4-[18F]fluorobenzyl-L-cysteine ([18F]DCFBC) 24 , and [99mTc](2-pyridylmethyl)2N(CH2)4CH-(CO2H)NHCO-(CH2)6CO-NH-lys-NHCONH-glu) ([99mTc] L1 25 ( Figure 1 ). Here we report the molecular modeling, radiosynthesis, in vitro PSMA inhibitory potency, tissue uptake selectivity, and preclinical imaging of the latest compounds in our series of low molecular weight agents for imaging PCa. Those agents include: 2-[3-[1-carboxy-5-(4-[125I]iodo-benzoylamino)-pentyl]-ureido]-pentanedioic acid ([125I] 3 ), 2-[3-[1-carboxy-5-(4-[18F]fluoro-benzoylamino)-pentyl]-ureido]-pentanedioic acid ([18F] 6 ) and 2-(3-[1-carboxy-5-[(5-[125I]iodo-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl]-ureido)-pentanedioic acid ([125I] 8 ).  Results and Discussion Design of PSMA Inhibitors As mentioned above, we previously reported SPECT and PET imaging probes of urea-based PSMA inhibitors including [125I]DCIT, [11C]DCMC, [18F]DCFBC, and [99mTc] L1 . [125I]DCIT is a derivative of a tyrosine-glutamate urea whereas [11C]DCMC and [18F]DCFBC are derivatives of a cysteine-glutamate urea. Compound [99mTc] L1 consists of Lys-C(O)-Glu to which a chelate at the terminus of a linker moiety has been attached. In this work we chose to investigate further derivatives of Lys-C(O)-Glu in order to 1) take advantage of the many radiohalogenation methods and radiohalogenated prosthetic groups developed previously for reaction with the ?-amino group of lysine residues 26 , and 2) increase the structural diversity of this class of PSMA inhibitors. We accordingly designed the syntheses of 3 , 6 , and 8 to utilize the tri- p -methoxybenzyl (tri-PMB) ester of 2-[3-(5-amino-1-carboxy-pentyl-ureido)]-pentanedioic acid as a common starting material. Chemistry Synthesis The synthesis of 3 , 6 and 8 are shown in Schemes 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively. N -hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-iodobenzoate 27 and N -hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-fluorobenzoate 28 were reacted with the tri-PMB ester of Lys-C(O)-Glu 1 25 to provide 2 ( Scheme 1 ) and 5 ( Scheme 2 ), respectively. The PMB groups were then removed using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/anisole to yield compounds 3 and 6 , respectively. N -Hydroxysuccinimidyl-5-(tri- n -butylstannyl)-3-pyridinecarboxylate 29 was reacted with 1 to give 7 ( Scheme 3 ), followed by iododestannylation and ester cleavage to give 8 . Modeling of Inhibitors in the Active Site of PSMA Recently determined GCPII (PSMA) crystal structures made it possible to perform structure-based molecular modeling studies with 3 , 6 and 8 30 - 32 . An X-ray structure of PSMA complexed with 2-PMPA (PDB ID: 2PVW) was used for modeling due to the high resolution of this structure (1.71Å) and the small number of missing amino acid residues 32 . Interestingly, PSMA exists in two conformations including a “binding” conformer and a “stacking” conformer in the arginine-rich region (S1-binding pocket) of the active site 33 . We carried out docking studies of 3 , 6 and 8 with both conformers using a CHARMm-based CDOCKER module implemented in Discovery Studio 2.0 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) 34 . Details of that procedure are available in the Supporting Information . Analysis of the docked poses demonstrated that potential binding modes of the three compounds were very similar to that of 2-PMPA, showing that the glutamate moiety of the three compounds completely overlapped with the pentanedioic acid moiety of 2-PMPA, irrespective of which conformer was under study ( Figures 1 and 2 in the Supporting Information ). The only differences among the three compounds with respect to their binding to either conformer were observed in the arginine patch. The subpocket generated by three arginines (Arg 463, 534, and 536) in the binding conformer can accommodate the 4-fluorophenyl substituent completely and the 4-iodophenyl and 5-iodo-3-pyridyl groups partially, while all three projected into the tunnel region when docked with the stacking conformer. CDOCKER scores of the best poses with the binding conformer of PSMA (83.177 for 3 , 83.172 for 6 , 87.610 for 8 ) were higher than those with the stacking conformer (82.193 for 3 , 75.32 for 6 , 78.134 for 8 ), indicating that the binding conformer of PSMA likely generates a more stable complex with 3 , 6 and 8 than does the stacking conformer. We also resolved the PSMA crystal structure complexed with 3 (PDB ID: 3D7H). Details of PSMA co-crystallized with 3 , as well as with other urea-based PSMA inhibitors such as DCIT, DCMC and DCFBC, are described elsewhere (manuscript under review). As predicted from modeling studies, only the binding conformation of the arginine patch region was found in PSMA complexed with 3 . To elucidate potential binding modes of the other two compounds ( 6 and 8 ), we carried out docking studies using the 3D coordinates of 3D7H in the presence or in the absence of water molecules in the active site. The best poses of 3 , 6 and 8 from the docking studies using the CDOCKER module are shown in Figure 2a , overlaid with crystal ligand, i.e., the compound as it is co-crystallized with PSMA, of 3 . As shown in Figure 2a , all of the radionuclide-bearing moieties (4-iodophenyl, 4-fluorophenyl, and 5-iodo-3-pyridyl) were located within the arginine patch of the S1 binding site. 4-Iodophenyl and 4-fluorophenyl groups protruded deeply within the subpocket compared to the 5-iodo-3-pyridyl moiety. CDOCKER scores of the three poses are ordered 3 (80.63) > 6 (72.39) > 8 (69.78). Detailed polar interaction of crystal ligand 3 and the best poses of 6 and 8 with PSMA are available in the Supporting Information . The cationic sidechains of Arg 463 and Arg 534 provide cation-? interactions with the aromatic rings of 3 , 6 , and 8 , leading to stabilization of the ligand within the subpocket. Docking results of PSMA without water molecules in the active site showed that the radionuclide-bearing moieties of 6 and 8 were outside of the subpocket and projected into the tunnel region ( Figure 2b ) while the 4-iodophenyl group of 3 was projected into the subpocket. Based on in vitro PSMA inhibitory activities and molecular modeling studies, it appears that ligand interaction with the subpocket of the S1 binding site contributes more to binding affinity than does interaction with the tunnel region. Radiochemistry As shown in Scheme 1 , [125I] 3 was prepared via iododestannylation of the corresponding tri- n -butylstannyl precursor 4 followed by deprotection. The final product was obtained after purification by radio-high performance liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC). The radiochemical yield of this reaction ranged from 65-80% (n = 3). Specific radioactivity was > 700 Ci/mmol (25.9 GBq/?mol). The radiosynthesis of [18F] 6 is shown in Scheme 2 . N -Hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-[18F]iodobenzoate ([18F]SFB) was prepared by the procedure of Chen et al. 35 [18F]SFB was reacted with 1 , followed by deprotection and purification by radio-HPLC to give [18F] 6 . The decay-corrected radiochemical yield of [18F] 6 ranged from 30-35%, based on starting [18F]fluoride (n = 3). The mean synthesis time was 180 min from the time of addition of [18F]fluoride. Starting from 40 mCi of [18F]fluoride, the specific radioactivity of [18F] 6 was 250-300 Ci/mmol (9.1 - 11.1 GBq/?mol). As shown in Scheme 3 , [125I] 8 was prepared using radioiododestannylation of the corresponding tri- n -butylstannyl precursor 7 followed by deprotection and purification by radio-HPLC. The radiochemical yields of this reaction ranged from 59-75% (n = 3). Specific radioactivity was > 2,000 Ci/mmol (74.0 GBq/?mol). Biological Results <italic>In Vitro</italic> Binding The NAALADase inhibition assay was undertaken to determine the K i value for 3 , 6 and 8 36 . The concentration of each compound was varied from 0.01 nM to 1000 nM against a fixed amount of [3H]NAAG (30 nM). The NAALADase (PSMA) was prepared from LNCaP cell lysates. The percentage of the enzymatic cleavage product, [3H]glutamate, produced was measured by scintillation counting and was plotted against the logarithmic concentration of the compound under study. Linear regression of the resulting data were solved for 50% [3H]glutamate production (50% inhibition) and resulted in K i values of 0.010 nM for 3 , 0.256 nM for 6 and 0.351 nM for 8 ( Table 1 ). These results are similar to other compounds of this class 37 . Compounds 3 , 6 , and 8 were also evaluated using a fluorescence-based inhibition assay 37 as a second check on affinity and gave K i values of 0.010, 0.194, and 0.557 nM, respectively. <italic>Ex Vivo</italic>Biodistribution and Imaging Compound [125I] 3 was injected intravenously into severe-combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing both PC-3 PIP (PSMA+) and PC-3 flu (PSMA-) xenografts. Table 2 outlines the ex vivo rodent tissue distribution results of [125I] 3 . The blood, kidney, urinary bladder, spleen and PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor display high uptake at the initial, 30 min postinjection (p.i.) time point. By 60 min p.i., the uptake in PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor achieved its highest absolute value. The kidney achieved its maximal uptake at 24 h p.i. The values noted in the kidney are largely due to specific binding rather than renal clearance, due to the expression of high amounts of PSMA in the proximal renal tubule 38 , 39 . The PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:kidney ratio remained constant (1:10) over 48 h. The spleen also exhibited high uptake (141 ± 14% ID/g) at 1 h, perhaps due to the presence of GCPIII, a close homolog of GCPII/PSMA 40 . We speculate that [125I] 3 may bind to GCPIII as well as to GCPII, as demonstrated by several other PSMA ligands 41 . However, unlike the kidneys there was slow washout from the spleen over time. Urinary bladder uptake represents excretion at all time points, i.e., there was no specific binding to bladder wall. Tumor uptake indicated a high degree of specificity represented by the PSMA+ PIP:flu ratio of 11:1 at 60 min, rising to 140:1 at 48 h. Radiopharmaceutical uptake within tumor relative to other organs also increased with time, providing high PSMA+ PIP:organ ratios. We did not remove bone as part of our ex vivo assay, however, no bone uptake was noted on imaging (see below). Little metabolism for compounds of this class has been demonstrated previously 22 , 25 , 24 . We did not perform site-specific blockade studies as we have previously proved the PSMA status of these tumor lines (PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and flu) by western blotting (data not shown) and have other publications demonstrating PSMA-selective targeting and blockade in this model 23 , 25 . Compound [125I] 3 was injected intravenously into a SCID mouse bearing both PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and PC-3 flu xenografts followed by SPECT-CT imaging. Figure 3 shows a SPECT-CT image of radiopharmaceutical uptake at 4 h p.i. Note the intense uptake in the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and absence of uptake in the PC-3 flu tumor. The small amount of radiopharmaceutical uptake seen in the liver, with no concurrent gastrointestinal uptake, is likely due to the hydrophilic nature of125I] 3 (ClogD = -5.16 at pH 7.4) and is consistent with the ex vivo biodistribution data. The very intense uptake in the kidneys is also consistent with the ex vivo biodistribution data. Table 3 illustrates tissue uptake of [18F] 6 . This radiopharmaceutical also displayed rapid, specific uptake within PSMA+ PIP tumors (8.6 ± 3.1% ID/g at 30 min. p.i.). At 1 h p.i. the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:PC-3 flu ratio was 21:1. As with [125I] 3 the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:kidney ratio remained roughly constant (1:10) over the length of the biodistribution. Uptake in and washout from nonspecific tissues were low and fast, respectively. Only the liver and spleen displayed uptake values that rivaled those seen in PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor, although this radioactivity cleared with time. Compared to [18F]DCFBC 24 , [18F] 6 had similar PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor uptake but slower clearance from nontarget tissues, including liver, spleen and kidney. Compound [18F] 6 was injected intravenously into a tumor-bearing mouse for PET imaging. Figure 4 shows the averaged results of the dynamic scan from 94-120 min p.i. The uptake pattern for [18F] 6 is very similar to that seen for [125I] 3 : easily observed within PSMA+ PIP tumor, none within flu tumor, high renal uptake and a modest degree of liver uptake. That result was expected due to similar ClogD values for [18F] 6 (-5.64 at pH 7.4) and [125I] 3 . The urinary bladder was visualized at 2 h p.i. due to the continually accumulating presence of radioactive urine, however, as with [125I] 3 , specific binding to the bladder wall was not demonstrated. Table 4 outlines the ex vivo rodent tissue distribution results of [125I] 8 . The liver, spleen, kidney and PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor displayed high uptake at the initial, 30 min p.i., time point. By 60 min p.i., the kidney displayed the highest uptake while that in PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor remained steady, showing a similar value to that at 30 min. By 24 h, there was complete clearance of radioactivity from the individual, nontarget organs. The values noted in the kidney are largely due to specific binding rather than renal clearance, as for the other radiopharmaceuticals discussed above. Urinary bladder uptake represented excretion at all time points, i.e., there was no specific binding to bladder wall, while tumor uptake demonstrated a high degree of specificity represented by the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:PC-3 flu uptake ratio of 18:1 at 30 min, rising to 47:1 at 8 h. In addition, the radiopharmaceutical uptake within tumor relative to other organs increased with time due to the rapid clearance from normal organs. That was most noticeable in the clearance from the spleen, where the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:spleen ratio increased from 0.5:1 at 0.5 h to 3:1 at 4 h compared to [125I] 3 , where the ratios only increased from 1:10 at 0.5 h to 1:5 at 48 h. Compound [125I] 8 was injected intravenously into a SCID mouse bearing an LNCaP (PSMA+) tumor followed by SPECT-CT imaging. Figure 5 shows a SPECT-CT image of radiopharmaceutical uptake at 4 h p.i. Tumor uptake was high, with little uptake in normal tissues. At 4 h p.i. the radioactivity in the tumor appeared even more intense than that in the kidneys. Discussion Unlike many other cancers, PCa is particularly difficult to detect using existing molecular imaging tracers. There are several reasons for that, including the relatively slow growth and metabolic rate of PCa compared to other malignancies as well as the small size of the organ and proximity to the urinary bladder, into which most radiopharmaceuticals are eventually excreted. Molecular imaging may provide a way by which not only to detect tumor in vivo , but also to provide information regarding the biology of the lesion if a mechanism-specific agent is used. For example, [18F]FDHT can be used to study the androgen receptor status of tumors 14 . Likewise, the PSMA-based agents described here can report on the presence of this marker, which is increasingly recognized as an important prognostic determinate in PCa 42 . It is also the target for a variety of new PCa therapies 43 . Among the three compounds discussed here, namely [125I] 3 , [18F] 6 and [125I] 8 , [125I] 3 and [125I] 8 are designed for SPECT imaging, if 123I is substituted for the 125I used in this experimental study, while [18F] 6 is designed for PET. In principle, all three compounds can be used for PET if the two radioiodinated compounds are labeled with 124I. The two radioiodinated compounds were prepared in high yield and specific radioactivity, while [18F] 6 was prepared in high radiochemical yield, but the specific activity was relatively low, due to the low amount of starting [18F]F- (40 mCi) used in the manual synthesis here described. The specific radioactivity of the starting [18F]F- can be improved by using higher levels of [18F]F- and a remote synthesis. In each case, the radiosynthesis was straightforward, as [125I] 3 and [18F] 6 could be synthesized by coupling the intermediate Lys-C(O)-Glu with the corresponding N -hydroxysuccinimidyl benzoate, while a similar approach was used for [125I] 8 , merely replacing the benzoate with a pyridinecarboxylate moiety. The synthesis of both the halobenzoate and pyridinecarboxylate radionuclide-bearing precursors have been published 44 , 45 , 28 , 30 , while the Lys-C(O)-Glu urea precursor has been used by us previously to develop SPECT agents 25 . The relative ease of synthesis of compounds of this class suggests that they will be amenable for use at a wide variety of imaging centers. Not surprisingly, 3 , 6 and 8 assume similar conformations within the PSMA active site. The radionuclide-bearing moiety resides within the arginine patch region of the S1 binding site in each case, however, that of 8 is not as deep within the pocket ( Figure 2a ). Compound 3 has been co-crystallized with PSMA (manuscript under review), and the aromatic phenyl ring for that compound shows productive cation-? stacking interactions with guanidine functions of Arg 463 and Arg 534 of the enzyme, whereas the pyridine moiety of 8 forms a less productive cation-? interaction. However, unlike 3 or 6 , 8 was found to be able to interact with Asp 465 ( via the pyridine nitrogen) and a water molecule ( via the carbonyl group of 5-iodonicotinamido moiety) in the S1' subpocket (see Supporting Information , Figure 5 ). Those additional interactions likely offset the less productive cation-? interaction geometry of 8 , providing a high-affinity interaction and an imaging agent that gives clear delineation of tumor ( Figure 5 ). While 6 adopts a very similar conformation within the active site to 3 , it binds with lower affinity, likely due to additional interactions of the iodine within the positively-charged arginine patch for 3 . In all, the affinities of 3 , 6 and 8 ( Table 1 ) track with predications based on molecular modeling. Regarding ex vivo biodistribution, [125I] 3 demonstrated only about twice the tumor uptake at 1 h p.i. as [18F] 6 , while its affinity is about twenty-five times higher. The target to nontarget (PSMA+ PC-3PIP:PC-3flu) ratios for [18F] 6 , however, were higher than for [125I] 3 at 0.5 - 1 h p.i., reflecting lower nonspecific binding, however the two compounds are equivalent by 2 h. Target to nontarget ratios rise to approximately 140 at 48 hours p.i. for [125I] 3 and to 35 at 5 hours p.i. for [18F] 6 . Compound [125I] 8 differs from [125I] 3 in that the aromatic ring is a pyridine and the iodine is substituted at the 3-position. At 1 h p.i. [125I] 8 demonstrated a similarly high tumor uptake (12.1 ± 4.9 %ID/g) compared to [125I] 3 , but had a much higher target to nontarget tissue ratio at that time (20), which rose to 47 at 8 h p.i. Compound [125I] 3 took 12 h to reach that ratio. Interestingly, the affinity of [125I] 8 is the lowest among the three compounds tested ( Table 1 ), however, compared with [125I] 3 , it provided a higher target to nontarget ratio at 1 h p.i., equivalent to that of [125I] 3 . As demonstrated in our previous work with 99mTc-labeled compounds of this series, we again show that there is not a clear relationship between affinity and in vivo tumor uptake selectivity. Notably, the affinities of these compounds are quite high ( Table 1 ) and the tumors are clearly delineated ( Figures 3 - 5 ). Based on the in vivo imaging studies, [125I] 3 and [125I] 8 have appropriate pharmacokinetics and imaging characteristics for imaging of PSMA+ prostate cancer with SPECT when radiolabeled with 123I, while [18F] 6 and [124I] 3 would be useful for PET. All compounds demonstrate high target to nontarget tissue ratios relatively soon after injection, making any of them convenient for clinical use. The syntheses are also adaptable to an automated format. Although our previous 18F-labeled inhibitor, [18F]DCFBC 24 , produced higher PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:organ ratios than [18F] 6, [18F] 6 can be prepared in higher radiochemical yield. Additionally, automated syntheses of [18F]SFB, the precursor for [18F] 6 , have been reported suggesting that the radiosynthesis of [18F] 6 may be easier to automate 46 , 47 . Radiation dosimetry and toxicity studies of this latest series of compounds are currently under way.  Results and Discussion Design of PSMA Inhibitors As mentioned above, we previously reported SPECT and PET imaging probes of urea-based PSMA inhibitors including [125I]DCIT, [11C]DCMC, [18F]DCFBC, and [99mTc] L1 . [125I]DCIT is a derivative of a tyrosine-glutamate urea whereas [11C]DCMC and [18F]DCFBC are derivatives of a cysteine-glutamate urea. Compound [99mTc] L1 consists of Lys-C(O)-Glu to which a chelate at the terminus of a linker moiety has been attached. In this work we chose to investigate further derivatives of Lys-C(O)-Glu in order to 1) take advantage of the many radiohalogenation methods and radiohalogenated prosthetic groups developed previously for reaction with the ?-amino group of lysine residues 26 , and 2) increase the structural diversity of this class of PSMA inhibitors. We accordingly designed the syntheses of 3 , 6 , and 8 to utilize the tri- p -methoxybenzyl (tri-PMB) ester of 2-[3-(5-amino-1-carboxy-pentyl-ureido)]-pentanedioic acid as a common starting material. Chemistry Synthesis The synthesis of 3 , 6 and 8 are shown in Schemes 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively. N -hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-iodobenzoate 27 and N -hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-fluorobenzoate 28 were reacted with the tri-PMB ester of Lys-C(O)-Glu 1 25 to provide 2 ( Scheme 1 ) and 5 ( Scheme 2 ), respectively. The PMB groups were then removed using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/anisole to yield compounds 3 and 6 , respectively. N -Hydroxysuccinimidyl-5-(tri- n -butylstannyl)-3-pyridinecarboxylate 29 was reacted with 1 to give 7 ( Scheme 3 ), followed by iododestannylation and ester cleavage to give 8 . Modeling of Inhibitors in the Active Site of PSMA Recently determined GCPII (PSMA) crystal structures made it possible to perform structure-based molecular modeling studies with 3 , 6 and 8 30 - 32 . An X-ray structure of PSMA complexed with 2-PMPA (PDB ID: 2PVW) was used for modeling due to the high resolution of this structure (1.71Å) and the small number of missing amino acid residues 32 . Interestingly, PSMA exists in two conformations including a “binding” conformer and a “stacking” conformer in the arginine-rich region (S1-binding pocket) of the active site 33 . We carried out docking studies of 3 , 6 and 8 with both conformers using a CHARMm-based CDOCKER module implemented in Discovery Studio 2.0 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) 34 . Details of that procedure are available in the Supporting Information . Analysis of the docked poses demonstrated that potential binding modes of the three compounds were very similar to that of 2-PMPA, showing that the glutamate moiety of the three compounds completely overlapped with the pentanedioic acid moiety of 2-PMPA, irrespective of which conformer was under study ( Figures 1 and 2 in the Supporting Information ). The only differences among the three compounds with respect to their binding to either conformer were observed in the arginine patch. The subpocket generated by three arginines (Arg 463, 534, and 536) in the binding conformer can accommodate the 4-fluorophenyl substituent completely and the 4-iodophenyl and 5-iodo-3-pyridyl groups partially, while all three projected into the tunnel region when docked with the stacking conformer. CDOCKER scores of the best poses with the binding conformer of PSMA (83.177 for 3 , 83.172 for 6 , 87.610 for 8 ) were higher than those with the stacking conformer (82.193 for 3 , 75.32 for 6 , 78.134 for 8 ), indicating that the binding conformer of PSMA likely generates a more stable complex with 3 , 6 and 8 than does the stacking conformer. We also resolved the PSMA crystal structure complexed with 3 (PDB ID: 3D7H). Details of PSMA co-crystallized with 3 , as well as with other urea-based PSMA inhibitors such as DCIT, DCMC and DCFBC, are described elsewhere (manuscript under review). As predicted from modeling studies, only the binding conformation of the arginine patch region was found in PSMA complexed with 3 . To elucidate potential binding modes of the other two compounds ( 6 and 8 ), we carried out docking studies using the 3D coordinates of 3D7H in the presence or in the absence of water molecules in the active site. The best poses of 3 , 6 and 8 from the docking studies using the CDOCKER module are shown in Figure 2a , overlaid with crystal ligand, i.e., the compound as it is co-crystallized with PSMA, of 3 . As shown in Figure 2a , all of the radionuclide-bearing moieties (4-iodophenyl, 4-fluorophenyl, and 5-iodo-3-pyridyl) were located within the arginine patch of the S1 binding site. 4-Iodophenyl and 4-fluorophenyl groups protruded deeply within the subpocket compared to the 5-iodo-3-pyridyl moiety. CDOCKER scores of the three poses are ordered 3 (80.63) > 6 (72.39) > 8 (69.78). Detailed polar interaction of crystal ligand 3 and the best poses of 6 and 8 with PSMA are available in the Supporting Information . The cationic sidechains of Arg 463 and Arg 534 provide cation-? interactions with the aromatic rings of 3 , 6 , and 8 , leading to stabilization of the ligand within the subpocket. Docking results of PSMA without water molecules in the active site showed that the radionuclide-bearing moieties of 6 and 8 were outside of the subpocket and projected into the tunnel region ( Figure 2b ) while the 4-iodophenyl group of 3 was projected into the subpocket. Based on in vitro PSMA inhibitory activities and molecular modeling studies, it appears that ligand interaction with the subpocket of the S1 binding site contributes more to binding affinity than does interaction with the tunnel region. Radiochemistry As shown in Scheme 1 , [125I] 3 was prepared via iododestannylation of the corresponding tri- n -butylstannyl precursor 4 followed by deprotection. The final product was obtained after purification by radio-high performance liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC). The radiochemical yield of this reaction ranged from 65-80% (n = 3). Specific radioactivity was > 700 Ci/mmol (25.9 GBq/?mol). The radiosynthesis of [18F] 6 is shown in Scheme 2 . N -Hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-[18F]iodobenzoate ([18F]SFB) was prepared by the procedure of Chen et al. 35 [18F]SFB was reacted with 1 , followed by deprotection and purification by radio-HPLC to give [18F] 6 . The decay-corrected radiochemical yield of [18F] 6 ranged from 30-35%, based on starting [18F]fluoride (n = 3). The mean synthesis time was 180 min from the time of addition of [18F]fluoride. Starting from 40 mCi of [18F]fluoride, the specific radioactivity of [18F] 6 was 250-300 Ci/mmol (9.1 - 11.1 GBq/?mol). As shown in Scheme 3 , [125I] 8 was prepared using radioiododestannylation of the corresponding tri- n -butylstannyl precursor 7 followed by deprotection and purification by radio-HPLC. The radiochemical yields of this reaction ranged from 59-75% (n = 3). Specific radioactivity was > 2,000 Ci/mmol (74.0 GBq/?mol). Biological Results <italic>In Vitro</italic> Binding The NAALADase inhibition assay was undertaken to determine the K i value for 3 , 6 and 8 36 . The concentration of each compound was varied from 0.01 nM to 1000 nM against a fixed amount of [3H]NAAG (30 nM). The NAALADase (PSMA) was prepared from LNCaP cell lysates. The percentage of the enzymatic cleavage product, [3H]glutamate, produced was measured by scintillation counting and was plotted against the logarithmic concentration of the compound under study. Linear regression of the resulting data were solved for 50% [3H]glutamate production (50% inhibition) and resulted in K i values of 0.010 nM for 3 , 0.256 nM for 6 and 0.351 nM for 8 ( Table 1 ). These results are similar to other compounds of this class 37 . Compounds 3 , 6 , and 8 were also evaluated using a fluorescence-based inhibition assay 37 as a second check on affinity and gave K i values of 0.010, 0.194, and 0.557 nM, respectively. <italic>Ex Vivo</italic>Biodistribution and Imaging Compound [125I] 3 was injected intravenously into severe-combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing both PC-3 PIP (PSMA+) and PC-3 flu (PSMA-) xenografts. Table 2 outlines the ex vivo rodent tissue distribution results of [125I] 3 . The blood, kidney, urinary bladder, spleen and PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor display high uptake at the initial, 30 min postinjection (p.i.) time point. By 60 min p.i., the uptake in PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor achieved its highest absolute value. The kidney achieved its maximal uptake at 24 h p.i. The values noted in the kidney are largely due to specific binding rather than renal clearance, due to the expression of high amounts of PSMA in the proximal renal tubule 38 , 39 . The PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:kidney ratio remained constant (1:10) over 48 h. The spleen also exhibited high uptake (141 ± 14% ID/g) at 1 h, perhaps due to the presence of GCPIII, a close homolog of GCPII/PSMA 40 . We speculate that [125I] 3 may bind to GCPIII as well as to GCPII, as demonstrated by several other PSMA ligands 41 . However, unlike the kidneys there was slow washout from the spleen over time. Urinary bladder uptake represents excretion at all time points, i.e., there was no specific binding to bladder wall. Tumor uptake indicated a high degree of specificity represented by the PSMA+ PIP:flu ratio of 11:1 at 60 min, rising to 140:1 at 48 h. Radiopharmaceutical uptake within tumor relative to other organs also increased with time, providing high PSMA+ PIP:organ ratios. We did not remove bone as part of our ex vivo assay, however, no bone uptake was noted on imaging (see below). Little metabolism for compounds of this class has been demonstrated previously 22 , 25 , 24 . We did not perform site-specific blockade studies as we have previously proved the PSMA status of these tumor lines (PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and flu) by western blotting (data not shown) and have other publications demonstrating PSMA-selective targeting and blockade in this model 23 , 25 . Compound [125I] 3 was injected intravenously into a SCID mouse bearing both PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and PC-3 flu xenografts followed by SPECT-CT imaging. Figure 3 shows a SPECT-CT image of radiopharmaceutical uptake at 4 h p.i. Note the intense uptake in the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and absence of uptake in the PC-3 flu tumor. The small amount of radiopharmaceutical uptake seen in the liver, with no concurrent gastrointestinal uptake, is likely due to the hydrophilic nature of125I] 3 (ClogD = -5.16 at pH 7.4) and is consistent with the ex vivo biodistribution data. The very intense uptake in the kidneys is also consistent with the ex vivo biodistribution data. Table 3 illustrates tissue uptake of [18F] 6 . This radiopharmaceutical also displayed rapid, specific uptake within PSMA+ PIP tumors (8.6 ± 3.1% ID/g at 30 min. p.i.). At 1 h p.i. the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:PC-3 flu ratio was 21:1. As with [125I] 3 the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:kidney ratio remained roughly constant (1:10) over the length of the biodistribution. Uptake in and washout from nonspecific tissues were low and fast, respectively. Only the liver and spleen displayed uptake values that rivaled those seen in PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor, although this radioactivity cleared with time. Compared to [18F]DCFBC 24 , [18F] 6 had similar PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor uptake but slower clearance from nontarget tissues, including liver, spleen and kidney. Compound [18F] 6 was injected intravenously into a tumor-bearing mouse for PET imaging. Figure 4 shows the averaged results of the dynamic scan from 94-120 min p.i. The uptake pattern for [18F] 6 is very similar to that seen for [125I] 3 : easily observed within PSMA+ PIP tumor, none within flu tumor, high renal uptake and a modest degree of liver uptake. That result was expected due to similar ClogD values for [18F] 6 (-5.64 at pH 7.4) and [125I] 3 . The urinary bladder was visualized at 2 h p.i. due to the continually accumulating presence of radioactive urine, however, as with [125I] 3 , specific binding to the bladder wall was not demonstrated. Table 4 outlines the ex vivo rodent tissue distribution results of [125I] 8 . The liver, spleen, kidney and PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor displayed high uptake at the initial, 30 min p.i., time point. By 60 min p.i., the kidney displayed the highest uptake while that in PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor remained steady, showing a similar value to that at 30 min. By 24 h, there was complete clearance of radioactivity from the individual, nontarget organs. The values noted in the kidney are largely due to specific binding rather than renal clearance, as for the other radiopharmaceuticals discussed above. Urinary bladder uptake represented excretion at all time points, i.e., there was no specific binding to bladder wall, while tumor uptake demonstrated a high degree of specificity represented by the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:PC-3 flu uptake ratio of 18:1 at 30 min, rising to 47:1 at 8 h. In addition, the radiopharmaceutical uptake within tumor relative to other organs increased with time due to the rapid clearance from normal organs. That was most noticeable in the clearance from the spleen, where the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:spleen ratio increased from 0.5:1 at 0.5 h to 3:1 at 4 h compared to [125I] 3 , where the ratios only increased from 1:10 at 0.5 h to 1:5 at 48 h. Compound [125I] 8 was injected intravenously into a SCID mouse bearing an LNCaP (PSMA+) tumor followed by SPECT-CT imaging. Figure 5 shows a SPECT-CT image of radiopharmaceutical uptake at 4 h p.i. Tumor uptake was high, with little uptake in normal tissues. At 4 h p.i. the radioactivity in the tumor appeared even more intense than that in the kidneys. Discussion Unlike many other cancers, PCa is particularly difficult to detect using existing molecular imaging tracers. There are several reasons for that, including the relatively slow growth and metabolic rate of PCa compared to other malignancies as well as the small size of the organ and proximity to the urinary bladder, into which most radiopharmaceuticals are eventually excreted. Molecular imaging may provide a way by which not only to detect tumor in vivo , but also to provide information regarding the biology of the lesion if a mechanism-specific agent is used. For example, [18F]FDHT can be used to study the androgen receptor status of tumors 14 . Likewise, the PSMA-based agents described here can report on the presence of this marker, which is increasingly recognized as an important prognostic determinate in PCa 42 . It is also the target for a variety of new PCa therapies 43 . Among the three compounds discussed here, namely [125I] 3 , [18F] 6 and [125I] 8 , [125I] 3 and [125I] 8 are designed for SPECT imaging, if 123I is substituted for the 125I used in this experimental study, while [18F] 6 is designed for PET. In principle, all three compounds can be used for PET if the two radioiodinated compounds are labeled with 124I. The two radioiodinated compounds were prepared in high yield and specific radioactivity, while [18F] 6 was prepared in high radiochemical yield, but the specific activity was relatively low, due to the low amount of starting [18F]F- (40 mCi) used in the manual synthesis here described. The specific radioactivity of the starting [18F]F- can be improved by using higher levels of [18F]F- and a remote synthesis. In each case, the radiosynthesis was straightforward, as [125I] 3 and [18F] 6 could be synthesized by coupling the intermediate Lys-C(O)-Glu with the corresponding N -hydroxysuccinimidyl benzoate, while a similar approach was used for [125I] 8 , merely replacing the benzoate with a pyridinecarboxylate moiety. The synthesis of both the halobenzoate and pyridinecarboxylate radionuclide-bearing precursors have been published 44 , 45 , 28 , 30 , while the Lys-C(O)-Glu urea precursor has been used by us previously to develop SPECT agents 25 . The relative ease of synthesis of compounds of this class suggests that they will be amenable for use at a wide variety of imaging centers. Not surprisingly, 3 , 6 and 8 assume similar conformations within the PSMA active site. The radionuclide-bearing moiety resides within the arginine patch region of the S1 binding site in each case, however, that of 8 is not as deep within the pocket ( Figure 2a ). Compound 3 has been co-crystallized with PSMA (manuscript under review), and the aromatic phenyl ring for that compound shows productive cation-? stacking interactions with guanidine functions of Arg 463 and Arg 534 of the enzyme, whereas the pyridine moiety of 8 forms a less productive cation-? interaction. However, unlike 3 or 6 , 8 was found to be able to interact with Asp 465 ( via the pyridine nitrogen) and a water molecule ( via the carbonyl group of 5-iodonicotinamido moiety) in the S1' subpocket (see Supporting Information , Figure 5 ). Those additional interactions likely offset the less productive cation-? interaction geometry of 8 , providing a high-affinity interaction and an imaging agent that gives clear delineation of tumor ( Figure 5 ). While 6 adopts a very similar conformation within the active site to 3 , it binds with lower affinity, likely due to additional interactions of the iodine within the positively-charged arginine patch for 3 . In all, the affinities of 3 , 6 and 8 ( Table 1 ) track with predications based on molecular modeling. Regarding ex vivo biodistribution, [125I] 3 demonstrated only about twice the tumor uptake at 1 h p.i. as [18F] 6 , while its affinity is about twenty-five times higher. The target to nontarget (PSMA+ PC-3PIP:PC-3flu) ratios for [18F] 6 , however, were higher than for [125I] 3 at 0.5 - 1 h p.i., reflecting lower nonspecific binding, however the two compounds are equivalent by 2 h. Target to nontarget ratios rise to approximately 140 at 48 hours p.i. for [125I] 3 and to 35 at 5 hours p.i. for [18F] 6 . Compound [125I] 8 differs from [125I] 3 in that the aromatic ring is a pyridine and the iodine is substituted at the 3-position. At 1 h p.i. [125I] 8 demonstrated a similarly high tumor uptake (12.1 ± 4.9 %ID/g) compared to [125I] 3 , but had a much higher target to nontarget tissue ratio at that time (20), which rose to 47 at 8 h p.i. Compound [125I] 3 took 12 h to reach that ratio. Interestingly, the affinity of [125I] 8 is the lowest among the three compounds tested ( Table 1 ), however, compared with [125I] 3 , it provided a higher target to nontarget ratio at 1 h p.i., equivalent to that of [125I] 3 . As demonstrated in our previous work with 99mTc-labeled compounds of this series, we again show that there is not a clear relationship between affinity and in vivo tumor uptake selectivity. Notably, the affinities of these compounds are quite high ( Table 1 ) and the tumors are clearly delineated ( Figures 3 - 5 ). Based on the in vivo imaging studies, [125I] 3 and [125I] 8 have appropriate pharmacokinetics and imaging characteristics for imaging of PSMA+ prostate cancer with SPECT when radiolabeled with 123I, while [18F] 6 and [124I] 3 would be useful for PET. All compounds demonstrate high target to nontarget tissue ratios relatively soon after injection, making any of them convenient for clinical use. The syntheses are also adaptable to an automated format. Although our previous 18F-labeled inhibitor, [18F]DCFBC 24 , produced higher PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:organ ratios than [18F] 6, [18F] 6 can be prepared in higher radiochemical yield. Additionally, automated syntheses of [18F]SFB, the precursor for [18F] 6 , have been reported suggesting that the radiosynthesis of [18F] 6 may be easier to automate 46 , 47 . Radiation dosimetry and toxicity studies of this latest series of compounds are currently under way.  Design of PSMA Inhibitors As mentioned above, we previously reported SPECT and PET imaging probes of urea-based PSMA inhibitors including [125I]DCIT, [11C]DCMC, [18F]DCFBC, and [99mTc] L1 . [125I]DCIT is a derivative of a tyrosine-glutamate urea whereas [11C]DCMC and [18F]DCFBC are derivatives of a cysteine-glutamate urea. Compound [99mTc] L1 consists of Lys-C(O)-Glu to which a chelate at the terminus of a linker moiety has been attached. In this work we chose to investigate further derivatives of Lys-C(O)-Glu in order to 1) take advantage of the many radiohalogenation methods and radiohalogenated prosthetic groups developed previously for reaction with the ?-amino group of lysine residues 26 , and 2) increase the structural diversity of this class of PSMA inhibitors. We accordingly designed the syntheses of 3 , 6 , and 8 to utilize the tri- p -methoxybenzyl (tri-PMB) ester of 2-[3-(5-amino-1-carboxy-pentyl-ureido)]-pentanedioic acid as a common starting material.  Design of PSMA Inhibitors As mentioned above, we previously reported SPECT and PET imaging probes of urea-based PSMA inhibitors including [125I]DCIT, [11C]DCMC, [18F]DCFBC, and [99mTc] L1 . [125I]DCIT is a derivative of a tyrosine-glutamate urea whereas [11C]DCMC and [18F]DCFBC are derivatives of a cysteine-glutamate urea. Compound [99mTc] L1 consists of Lys-C(O)-Glu to which a chelate at the terminus of a linker moiety has been attached. In this work we chose to investigate further derivatives of Lys-C(O)-Glu in order to 1) take advantage of the many radiohalogenation methods and radiohalogenated prosthetic groups developed previously for reaction with the ?-amino group of lysine residues 26 , and 2) increase the structural diversity of this class of PSMA inhibitors. We accordingly designed the syntheses of 3 , 6 , and 8 to utilize the tri- p -methoxybenzyl (tri-PMB) ester of 2-[3-(5-amino-1-carboxy-pentyl-ureido)]-pentanedioic acid as a common starting material.  Chemistry Synthesis The synthesis of 3 , 6 and 8 are shown in Schemes 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively. N -hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-iodobenzoate 27 and N -hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-fluorobenzoate 28 were reacted with the tri-PMB ester of Lys-C(O)-Glu 1 25 to provide 2 ( Scheme 1 ) and 5 ( Scheme 2 ), respectively. The PMB groups were then removed using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/anisole to yield compounds 3 and 6 , respectively. N -Hydroxysuccinimidyl-5-(tri- n -butylstannyl)-3-pyridinecarboxylate 29 was reacted with 1 to give 7 ( Scheme 3 ), followed by iododestannylation and ester cleavage to give 8 . Modeling of Inhibitors in the Active Site of PSMA Recently determined GCPII (PSMA) crystal structures made it possible to perform structure-based molecular modeling studies with 3 , 6 and 8 30 - 32 . An X-ray structure of PSMA complexed with 2-PMPA (PDB ID: 2PVW) was used for modeling due to the high resolution of this structure (1.71Å) and the small number of missing amino acid residues 32 . Interestingly, PSMA exists in two conformations including a “binding” conformer and a “stacking” conformer in the arginine-rich region (S1-binding pocket) of the active site 33 . We carried out docking studies of 3 , 6 and 8 with both conformers using a CHARMm-based CDOCKER module implemented in Discovery Studio 2.0 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) 34 . Details of that procedure are available in the Supporting Information . Analysis of the docked poses demonstrated that potential binding modes of the three compounds were very similar to that of 2-PMPA, showing that the glutamate moiety of the three compounds completely overlapped with the pentanedioic acid moiety of 2-PMPA, irrespective of which conformer was under study ( Figures 1 and 2 in the Supporting Information ). The only differences among the three compounds with respect to their binding to either conformer were observed in the arginine patch. The subpocket generated by three arginines (Arg 463, 534, and 536) in the binding conformer can accommodate the 4-fluorophenyl substituent completely and the 4-iodophenyl and 5-iodo-3-pyridyl groups partially, while all three projected into the tunnel region when docked with the stacking conformer. CDOCKER scores of the best poses with the binding conformer of PSMA (83.177 for 3 , 83.172 for 6 , 87.610 for 8 ) were higher than those with the stacking conformer (82.193 for 3 , 75.32 for 6 , 78.134 for 8 ), indicating that the binding conformer of PSMA likely generates a more stable complex with 3 , 6 and 8 than does the stacking conformer. We also resolved the PSMA crystal structure complexed with 3 (PDB ID: 3D7H). Details of PSMA co-crystallized with 3 , as well as with other urea-based PSMA inhibitors such as DCIT, DCMC and DCFBC, are described elsewhere (manuscript under review). As predicted from modeling studies, only the binding conformation of the arginine patch region was found in PSMA complexed with 3 . To elucidate potential binding modes of the other two compounds ( 6 and 8 ), we carried out docking studies using the 3D coordinates of 3D7H in the presence or in the absence of water molecules in the active site. The best poses of 3 , 6 and 8 from the docking studies using the CDOCKER module are shown in Figure 2a , overlaid with crystal ligand, i.e., the compound as it is co-crystallized with PSMA, of 3 . As shown in Figure 2a , all of the radionuclide-bearing moieties (4-iodophenyl, 4-fluorophenyl, and 5-iodo-3-pyridyl) were located within the arginine patch of the S1 binding site. 4-Iodophenyl and 4-fluorophenyl groups protruded deeply within the subpocket compared to the 5-iodo-3-pyridyl moiety. CDOCKER scores of the three poses are ordered 3 (80.63) > 6 (72.39) > 8 (69.78). Detailed polar interaction of crystal ligand 3 and the best poses of 6 and 8 with PSMA are available in the Supporting Information . The cationic sidechains of Arg 463 and Arg 534 provide cation-? interactions with the aromatic rings of 3 , 6 , and 8 , leading to stabilization of the ligand within the subpocket. Docking results of PSMA without water molecules in the active site showed that the radionuclide-bearing moieties of 6 and 8 were outside of the subpocket and projected into the tunnel region ( Figure 2b ) while the 4-iodophenyl group of 3 was projected into the subpocket. Based on in vitro PSMA inhibitory activities and molecular modeling studies, it appears that ligand interaction with the subpocket of the S1 binding site contributes more to binding affinity than does interaction with the tunnel region. Radiochemistry As shown in Scheme 1 , [125I] 3 was prepared via iododestannylation of the corresponding tri- n -butylstannyl precursor 4 followed by deprotection. The final product was obtained after purification by radio-high performance liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC). The radiochemical yield of this reaction ranged from 65-80% (n = 3). Specific radioactivity was > 700 Ci/mmol (25.9 GBq/?mol). The radiosynthesis of [18F] 6 is shown in Scheme 2 . N -Hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-[18F]iodobenzoate ([18F]SFB) was prepared by the procedure of Chen et al. 35 [18F]SFB was reacted with 1 , followed by deprotection and purification by radio-HPLC to give [18F] 6 . The decay-corrected radiochemical yield of [18F] 6 ranged from 30-35%, based on starting [18F]fluoride (n = 3). The mean synthesis time was 180 min from the time of addition of [18F]fluoride. Starting from 40 mCi of [18F]fluoride, the specific radioactivity of [18F] 6 was 250-300 Ci/mmol (9.1 - 11.1 GBq/?mol). As shown in Scheme 3 , [125I] 8 was prepared using radioiododestannylation of the corresponding tri- n -butylstannyl precursor 7 followed by deprotection and purification by radio-HPLC. The radiochemical yields of this reaction ranged from 59-75% (n = 3). Specific radioactivity was > 2,000 Ci/mmol (74.0 GBq/?mol).  Chemistry Synthesis The synthesis of 3 , 6 and 8 are shown in Schemes 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively. N -hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-iodobenzoate 27 and N -hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-fluorobenzoate 28 were reacted with the tri-PMB ester of Lys-C(O)-Glu 1 25 to provide 2 ( Scheme 1 ) and 5 ( Scheme 2 ), respectively. The PMB groups were then removed using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/anisole to yield compounds 3 and 6 , respectively. N -Hydroxysuccinimidyl-5-(tri- n -butylstannyl)-3-pyridinecarboxylate 29 was reacted with 1 to give 7 ( Scheme 3 ), followed by iododestannylation and ester cleavage to give 8 . Modeling of Inhibitors in the Active Site of PSMA Recently determined GCPII (PSMA) crystal structures made it possible to perform structure-based molecular modeling studies with 3 , 6 and 8 30 - 32 . An X-ray structure of PSMA complexed with 2-PMPA (PDB ID: 2PVW) was used for modeling due to the high resolution of this structure (1.71Å) and the small number of missing amino acid residues 32 . Interestingly, PSMA exists in two conformations including a “binding” conformer and a “stacking” conformer in the arginine-rich region (S1-binding pocket) of the active site 33 . We carried out docking studies of 3 , 6 and 8 with both conformers using a CHARMm-based CDOCKER module implemented in Discovery Studio 2.0 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) 34 . Details of that procedure are available in the Supporting Information .

The only differences among the three compounds with respect to their binding to either conformer were observed in the arginine patch. The subpocket generated by three arginines (Arg 463, 534, and 536) in the binding conformer can accommodate the 4-fluorophenyl substituent completely and the 4-iodophenyl and 5-iodo-3-pyridyl groups partially, while all three projected into the tunnel region when docked with the stacking conformer. CDOCKER scores of the best poses with the binding conformer of PSMA (83.177 for 3 , 83.172 for 6 , 87.610 for 8 ) were higher than those with the stacking conformer (82.193 for 3 , 75.32 for 6 , 78.134 for 8 ), indicating that the binding conformer of PSMA likely generates a more stable complex with 3 , 6 and 8 than does the stacking conformer. We also resolved the PSMA crystal structure complexed with 3 (PDB ID: 3D7H). Details of PSMA co-crystallized with 3 , as well as with other urea-based PSMA inhibitors such as DCIT, DCMC and DCFBC, are described elsewhere (manuscript under review).

The best poses of 3 , 6 and 8 from the docking studies using the CDOCKER module are shown in Figure 2a , overlaid with crystal ligand, i.e., the compound as it is co-crystallized with PSMA, of 3 . As shown in Figure 2a , all of the radionuclide-bearing moieties (4-iodophenyl, 4-fluorophenyl, and 5-iodo-3-pyridyl) were located within the arginine patch of the S1 binding site. 4-Iodophenyl and 4-fluorophenyl groups protruded deeply within the subpocket compared to the 5-iodo-3-pyridyl moiety. CDOCKER scores of the three poses are ordered 3 (80.63) > 6 (72.39) > 8 (69.78).

The cationic sidechains of Arg 463 and Arg 534 provide cation-? interactions with the aromatic rings of 3 , 6 , and 8 , leading to stabilization of the ligand within the subpocket. Docking results of PSMA without water molecules in the active site showed that the radionuclide-bearing moieties of 6 and 8 were outside of the subpocket and projected into the tunnel region ( Figure 2b ) while the 4-iodophenyl group of 3 was projected into the subpocket. Based on in vitro PSMA inhibitory activities and molecular modeling studies, it appears that ligand interaction with the subpocket of the S1 binding site contributes more to binding affinity than does interaction with the tunnel region. Radiochemistry As shown in Scheme 1 , [125I] 3 was prepared via iododestannylation of the corresponding tri- n -butylstannyl precursor 4 followed by deprotection. The final product was obtained after purification by radio-high performance liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC). The radiochemical yield of this reaction ranged from 65-80% (n = 3). Specific radioactivity was > 700 Ci/mmol (25.9 GBq/?mol). The radiosynthesis of [18F] 6 is shown in Scheme 2 . N -Hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-[18F]iodobenzoate ([18F]SFB) was prepared by the procedure of Chen et al. 35 [18F]SFB was reacted with 1 , followed by deprotection and purification by radio-HPLC to give [18F] 6 . The decay-corrected radiochemical yield of [18F] 6 ranged from 30-35%, based on starting [18F]fluoride (n = 3). The mean synthesis time was 180 min from the time of addition of [18F]fluoride. Starting from 40 mCi of [18F]fluoride, the specific radioactivity of [18F] 6 was 250-300 Ci/mmol (9.1 - 11.1 GBq/?mol). As shown in Scheme 3 , [125I] 8 was prepared using radioiododestannylation of the corresponding tri- n -butylstannyl precursor 7 followed by deprotection and purification by radio-HPLC. The radiochemical yields of this reaction ranged from 59-75% (n = 3). Specific radioactivity was > 2,000 Ci/mmol (74.0 GBq/?mol).  Synthesis The synthesis of 3 , 6 and 8 are shown in Schemes 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively. N -hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-iodobenzoate 27 and N -hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-fluorobenzoate 28 were reacted with the tri-PMB ester of Lys-C(O)-Glu 1 25 to provide 2 ( Scheme 1 ) and 5 ( Scheme 2 ), respectively. The PMB groups were then removed using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/anisole to yield compounds 3 and 6 , respectively. N -Hydroxysuccinimidyl-5-(tri- n -butylstannyl)-3-pyridinecarboxylate 29 was reacted with 1 to give 7 ( Scheme 3 ), followed by iododestannylation and ester cleavage to give 8 .

Modeling of Inhibitors in the Active Site of PSMA Recently determined GCPII (PSMA) crystal structures made it possible to perform structure-based molecular modeling studies with 3 , 6 and 8 30 - 32 . An X-ray structure of PSMA complexed with 2-PMPA (PDB ID: 2PVW) was used for modeling due to the high resolution of this structure (1.71Å) and the small number of missing amino acid residues 32 . Interestingly, PSMA exists in two conformations including a “binding” conformer and a “stacking” conformer in the arginine-rich region (S1-binding pocket) of the active site 33 . We carried out docking studies of 3 , 6 and 8 with both conformers using a CHARMm-based CDOCKER module implemented in Discovery Studio 2.0 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) 34 . Details of that procedure are available in the Supporting Information . Analysis of the docked poses demonstrated that potential binding modes of the three compounds were very similar to that of 2-PMPA, showing that the glutamate moiety of the three compounds completely overlapped with the pentanedioic acid moiety of 2-PMPA, irrespective of which conformer was under study ( Figures 1 and 2 in the Supporting Information ). The only differences among the three compounds with respect to their binding to either conformer were observed in the arginine patch. The subpocket generated by three arginines (Arg 463, 534, and 536) in the binding conformer can accommodate the 4-fluorophenyl substituent completely and the 4-iodophenyl and 5-iodo-3-pyridyl groups partially, while all three projected into the tunnel region when docked with the stacking conformer. CDOCKER scores of the best poses with the binding conformer of PSMA (83.177 for 3 , 83.172 for 6 , 87.610 for 8 ) were higher than those with the stacking conformer (82.193 for 3 , 75.32 for 6 , 78.134 for 8 ), indicating that the binding conformer of PSMA likely generates a more stable complex with 3 , 6 and 8 than does the stacking conformer. We also resolved the PSMA crystal structure complexed with 3 (PDB ID: 3D7H). Details of PSMA co-crystallized with 3 , as well as with other urea-based PSMA inhibitors such as DCIT, DCMC and DCFBC, are described elsewhere (manuscript under review). As predicted from modeling studies, only the binding conformation of the arginine patch region was found in PSMA complexed with 3 . To elucidate potential binding modes of the other two compounds ( 6 and 8 ), we carried out docking studies using the 3D coordinates of 3D7H in the presence or in the absence of water molecules in the active site. The best poses of 3 , 6 and 8 from the docking studies using the CDOCKER module are shown in Figure 2a , overlaid with crystal ligand, i.e., the compound as it is co-crystallized with PSMA, of 3 . As shown in Figure 2a , all of the radionuclide-bearing moieties (4-iodophenyl, 4-fluorophenyl, and 5-iodo-3-pyridyl) were located within the arginine patch of the S1 binding site. 4-Iodophenyl and 4-fluorophenyl groups protruded deeply within the subpocket compared to the 5-iodo-3-pyridyl moiety. CDOCKER scores of the three poses are ordered 3 (80.63) > 6 (72.39) > 8 (69.78). Detailed polar interaction of crystal ligand 3 and the best poses of 6 and 8 with PSMA are available in the Supporting Information . The cationic sidechains of Arg 463 and Arg 534 provide cation-? interactions with the aromatic rings of 3 , 6 , and 8 , leading to stabilization of the ligand within the subpocket. Docking results of PSMA without water molecules in the active site showed that the radionuclide-bearing moieties of 6 and 8 were outside of the subpocket and projected into the tunnel region ( Figure 2b ) while the 4-iodophenyl group of 3 was projected into the subpocket. Based on in vitro PSMA inhibitory activities and molecular modeling studies, it appears that ligand interaction with the subpocket of the S1 binding site contributes more to binding affinity than does interaction with the tunnel region.

Radiochemistry As shown in Scheme 1 , [125I] 3 was prepared via iododestannylation of the corresponding tri- n -butylstannyl precursor 4 followed by deprotection. The final product was obtained after purification by radio-high performance liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC). The radiochemical yield of this reaction ranged from 65-80% (n = 3). Specific radioactivity was > 700 Ci/mmol (25.9 GBq/?mol). The radiosynthesis of [18F] 6 is shown in Scheme 2 . N -Hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-[18F]iodobenzoate ([18F]SFB) was prepared by the procedure of Chen et al. 35 [18F]SFB was reacted with 1 , followed by deprotection and purification by radio-HPLC to give [18F] 6 .

The radiochemical yields of this reaction ranged from 59-75% (n = 3). Specific radioactivity was > 2,000 Ci/mmol (74.0 GBq/?mol).

Biological Results <italic>In Vitro</italic> Binding The NAALADase inhibition assay was undertaken to determine the K i value for 3 , 6 and 8 36 . The concentration of each compound was varied from 0.01 nM to 1000 nM against a fixed amount of [3H]NAAG (30 nM). The NAALADase (PSMA) was prepared from LNCaP cell lysates. The percentage of the enzymatic cleavage product, [3H]glutamate, produced was measured by scintillation counting and was plotted against the logarithmic concentration of the compound under study. Linear regression of the resulting data were solved for 50% [3H]glutamate production (50% inhibition) and resulted in K i values of 0.010 nM for 3 , 0.256 nM for 6 and 0.351 nM for 8 ( Table 1 ). These results are similar to other compounds of this class 37 . Compounds 3 , 6 , and 8 were also evaluated using a fluorescence-based inhibition assay 37 as a second check on affinity and gave K i values of 0.010, 0.194, and 0.557 nM, respectively. <italic>Ex Vivo</italic>Biodistribution and Imaging Compound [125I] 3 was injected intravenously into severe-combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing both PC-3 PIP (PSMA+) and PC-3 flu (PSMA-) xenografts. Table 2 outlines the ex vivo rodent tissue distribution results of [125I] 3 . The blood, kidney, urinary bladder, spleen and PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor display high uptake at the initial, 30 min postinjection (p.i.) time point. By 60 min p.i., the uptake in PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor achieved its highest absolute value. The kidney achieved its maximal uptake at 24 h p.i. The values noted in the kidney are largely due to specific binding rather than renal clearance, due to the expression of high amounts of PSMA in the proximal renal tubule 38 , 39 . The PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:kidney ratio remained constant (1:10) over 48 h. The spleen also exhibited high uptake (141 ± 14% ID/g) at 1 h, perhaps due to the presence of GCPIII, a close homolog of GCPII/PSMA 40 . We speculate that [125I] 3 may bind to GCPIII as well as to GCPII, as demonstrated by several other PSMA ligands 41 . However, unlike the kidneys there was slow washout from the spleen over time. Urinary bladder uptake represents excretion at all time points, i.e., there was no specific binding to bladder wall. Tumor uptake indicated a high degree of specificity represented by the PSMA+ PIP:flu ratio of 11:1 at 60 min, rising to 140:1 at 48 h. Radiopharmaceutical uptake within tumor relative to other organs also increased with time, providing high PSMA+ PIP:organ ratios. We did not remove bone as part of our ex vivo assay, however, no bone uptake was noted on imaging (see below). Little metabolism for compounds of this class has been demonstrated previously 22 , 25 , 24 . We did not perform site-specific blockade studies as we have previously proved the PSMA status of these tumor lines (PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and flu) by western blotting (data not shown) and have other publications demonstrating PSMA-selective targeting and blockade in this model 23 , 25 . Compound [125I] 3 was injected intravenously into a SCID mouse bearing both PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and PC-3 flu xenografts followed by SPECT-CT imaging. Figure 3 shows a SPECT-CT image of radiopharmaceutical uptake at 4 h p.i. Note the intense uptake in the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and absence of uptake in the PC-3 flu tumor. The small amount of radiopharmaceutical uptake seen in the liver, with no concurrent gastrointestinal uptake, is likely due to the hydrophilic nature of125I] 3 (ClogD = -5.16 at pH 7.4) and is consistent with the ex vivo biodistribution data. The very intense uptake in the kidneys is also consistent with the ex vivo biodistribution data. Table 3 illustrates tissue uptake of [18F] 6 . This radiopharmaceutical also displayed rapid, specific uptake within PSMA+ PIP tumors (8.6 ± 3.1% ID/g at 30 min. p.i.). At 1 h p.i. the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:PC-3 flu ratio was 21:1. As with [125I] 3 the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:kidney ratio remained roughly constant (1:10) over the length of the biodistribution. Uptake in and washout from nonspecific tissues were low and fast, respectively. Only the liver and spleen displayed uptake values that rivaled those seen in PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor, although this radioactivity cleared with time. Compared to [18F]DCFBC 24 , [18F] 6 had similar PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor uptake but slower clearance from nontarget tissues, including liver, spleen and kidney. Compound [18F] 6 was injected intravenously into a tumor-bearing mouse for PET imaging. Figure 4 shows the averaged results of the dynamic scan from 94-120 min p.i. The uptake pattern for [18F] 6 is very similar to that seen for [125I] 3 : easily observed within PSMA+ PIP tumor, none within flu tumor, high renal uptake and a modest degree of liver uptake. That result was expected due to similar ClogD values for [18F] 6 (-5.64 at pH 7.4) and [125I] 3 . The urinary bladder was visualized at 2 h p.i. due to the continually accumulating presence of radioactive urine, however, as with [125I] 3 , specific binding to the bladder wall was not demonstrated. Table 4 outlines the ex vivo rodent tissue distribution results of [125I] 8 . The liver, spleen, kidney and PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor displayed high uptake at the initial, 30 min p.i., time point. By 60 min p.i., the kidney displayed the highest uptake while that in PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor remained steady, showing a similar value to that at 30 min. By 24 h, there was complete clearance of radioactivity from the individual, nontarget organs. The values noted in the kidney are largely due to specific binding rather than renal clearance, as for the other radiopharmaceuticals discussed above. Urinary bladder uptake represented excretion at all time points, i.e., there was no specific binding to bladder wall, while tumor uptake demonstrated a high degree of specificity represented by the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:PC-3 flu uptake ratio of 18:1 at 30 min, rising to 47:1 at 8 h. In addition, the radiopharmaceutical uptake within tumor relative to other organs increased with time due to the rapid clearance from normal organs. That was most noticeable in the clearance from the spleen, where the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:spleen ratio increased from 0.5:1 at 0.5 h to 3:1 at 4 h compared to [125I] 3 , where the ratios only increased from 1:10 at 0.5 h to 1:5 at 48 h. Compound [125I] 8 was injected intravenously into a SCID mouse bearing an LNCaP (PSMA+) tumor followed by SPECT-CT imaging. Figure 5 shows a SPECT-CT image of radiopharmaceutical uptake at 4 h p.i. Tumor uptake was high, with little uptake in normal tissues. At 4 h p.i. the radioactivity in the tumor appeared even more intense than that in the kidneys.

The values noted in the kidney are largely due to specific binding rather than renal clearance, due to the expression of high amounts of PSMA in the proximal renal tubule 38 , 39 . The PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:kidney ratio remained constant (1:10) over 48 h. The spleen also exhibited high uptake (141 ± 14% ID/g) at 1 h, perhaps due to the presence of GCPIII, a close homolog of GCPII/PSMA 40 . We speculate that [125I] 3 may bind to GCPIII as well as to GCPII, as demonstrated by several other PSMA ligands 41 . However, unlike the kidneys there was slow washout from the spleen over time. Urinary bladder uptake represents excretion at all time points, i.e., there was no specific binding to bladder wall. Tumor uptake indicated a high degree of specificity represented by the PSMA+ PIP:flu ratio of 11:1 at 60 min, rising to 140:1 at 48 h. Radiopharmaceutical uptake within tumor relative to other organs also increased with time, providing high PSMA+ PIP:organ ratios. We did not remove bone as part of our ex vivo assay, however, no bone uptake was noted on imaging (see below). Little metabolism for compounds of this class has been demonstrated previously 22 , 25 , 24 . We did not perform site-specific blockade studies as we have previously proved the PSMA status of these tumor lines (PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and flu) by western blotting (data not shown) and have other publications demonstrating PSMA-selective targeting and blockade in this model 23 , 25 . Compound [125I] 3 was injected intravenously into a SCID mouse bearing both PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and PC-3 flu xenografts followed by SPECT-CT imaging. Figure 3 shows a SPECT-CT image of radiopharmaceutical uptake at 4 h p.i. Note the intense uptake in the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and absence of uptake in the PC-3 flu tumor. The small amount of radiopharmaceutical uptake seen in the liver, with no concurrent gastrointestinal uptake, is likely due to the hydrophilic nature of125I] 3 (ClogD = -5.16 at pH 7.4) and is consistent with the ex vivo biodistribution data. The very intense uptake in the kidneys is also consistent with the ex vivo biodistribution data. Table 3 illustrates tissue uptake of [18F] 6 . This radiopharmaceutical also displayed rapid, specific uptake within PSMA+ PIP tumors (8.6 ± 3.1% ID/g at 30 min. p.i.). At 1 h p.i. the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:PC-3 flu ratio was 21:1. As with [125I] 3 the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:kidney ratio remained roughly constant (1:10) over the length of the biodistribution. Uptake in and washout from nonspecific tissues were low and fast, respectively. Only the liver and spleen displayed uptake values that rivaled those seen in PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor, although this radioactivity cleared with time. Compared to [18F]DCFBC 24 , [18F] 6 had similar PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor uptake but slower clearance from nontarget tissues, including liver, spleen and kidney. Compound [18F] 6 was injected intravenously into a tumor-bearing mouse for PET imaging. Figure 4 shows the averaged results of the dynamic scan from 94-120 min p.i. The uptake pattern for [18F] 6 is very similar to that seen for [125I] 3 : easily observed within PSMA+ PIP tumor, none within flu tumor, high renal uptake and a modest degree of liver uptake. That result was expected due to similar ClogD values for [18F] 6 (-5.64 at pH 7.4) and [125I] 3 . The urinary bladder was visualized at 2 h p.i. due to the continually accumulating presence of radioactive urine, however, as with [125I] 3 , specific binding to the bladder wall was not demonstrated. Table 4 outlines the ex vivo rodent tissue distribution results of [125I] 8 . The liver, spleen, kidney and PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor displayed high uptake at the initial, 30 min p.i., time point. By 60 min p.i., the kidney displayed the highest uptake while that in PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor remained steady, showing a similar value to that at 30 min. By 24 h, there was complete clearance of radioactivity from the individual, nontarget organs. The values noted in the kidney are largely due to specific binding rather than renal clearance, as for the other radiopharmaceuticals discussed above. Urinary bladder uptake represented excretion at all time points, i.e., there was no specific binding to bladder wall, while tumor uptake demonstrated a high degree of specificity represented by the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:PC-3 flu uptake ratio of 18:1 at 30 min, rising to 47:1 at 8 h. In addition, the radiopharmaceutical uptake within tumor relative to other organs increased with time due to the rapid clearance from normal organs. That was most noticeable in the clearance from the spleen, where the PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:spleen ratio increased from 0.5:1 at 0.5 h to 3:1 at 4 h compared to [125I] 3 , where the ratios only increased from 1:10 at 0.5 h to 1:5 at 48 h. Compound [125I] 8 was injected intravenously into a SCID mouse bearing an LNCaP (PSMA+) tumor followed by SPECT-CT imaging. Figure 5 shows a SPECT-CT image of radiopharmaceutical uptake at 4 h p.i. Tumor uptake was high, with little uptake in normal tissues. At 4 h p.i. the radioactivity in the tumor appeared even more intense than that in the kidneys.  <italic>Ex Vivo</italic>Biodistribution and Imaging Compound [125I] 3 was injected intravenously into severe-combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing both PC-3 PIP (PSMA+) and PC-3 flu (PSMA-) xenografts. Table 2 outlines the ex vivo rodent tissue distribution results of [125I] 3 . The blood, kidney, urinary bladder, spleen and PSMA+ PC-3 PIP tumor display high uptake at the initial, 30 min postinjection (p.i.) time point.

Tumor uptake was high, with little uptake in normal tissues. At 4 h p.i. the radioactivity in the tumor appeared even more intense than that in the kidneys.  Discussion Unlike many other cancers, PCa is particularly difficult to detect using existing molecular imaging tracers. There are several reasons for that, including the relatively slow growth and metabolic rate of PCa compared to other malignancies as well as the small size of the organ and proximity to the urinary bladder, into which most radiopharmaceuticals are eventually excreted. Molecular imaging may provide a way by which not only to detect tumor in vivo , but also to provide information regarding the biology of the lesion if a mechanism-specific agent is used. For example, [18F]FDHT can be used to study the androgen receptor status of tumors 14 . Likewise, the PSMA-based agents described here can report on the presence of this marker, which is increasingly recognized as an important prognostic determinate in PCa 42 . It is also the target for a variety of new PCa therapies 43 . Among the three compounds discussed here, namely [125I] 3 , [18F] 6 and [125I] 8 , [125I] 3 and [125I] 8 are designed for SPECT imaging, if 123I is substituted for the 125I used in this experimental study, while [18F] 6 is designed for PET. In principle, all three compounds can be used for PET if the two radioiodinated compounds are labeled with 124I. The two radioiodinated compounds were prepared in high yield and specific radioactivity, while [18F] 6 was prepared in high radiochemical yield, but the specific activity was relatively low, due to the low amount of starting [18F]F- (40 mCi) used in the manual synthesis here described. The specific radioactivity of the starting [18F]F- can be improved by using higher levels of [18F]F- and a remote synthesis. In each case, the radiosynthesis was straightforward, as [125I] 3 and [18F] 6 could be synthesized by coupling the intermediate Lys-C(O)-Glu with the corresponding N -hydroxysuccinimidyl benzoate, while a similar approach was used for [125I] 8 , merely replacing the benzoate with a pyridinecarboxylate moiety. The synthesis of both the halobenzoate and pyridinecarboxylate radionuclide-bearing precursors have been published 44 , 45 , 28 , 30 , while the Lys-C(O)-Glu urea precursor has been used by us previously to develop SPECT agents 25 . The relative ease of synthesis of compounds of this class suggests that they will be amenable for use at a wide variety of imaging centers. Not surprisingly, 3 , 6 and 8 assume similar conformations within the PSMA active site. The radionuclide-bearing moiety resides within the arginine patch region of the S1 binding site in each case, however, that of 8 is not as deep within the pocket ( Figure 2a ). Compound 3 has been co-crystallized with PSMA (manuscript under review), and the aromatic phenyl ring for that compound shows productive cation-? stacking interactions with guanidine functions of Arg 463 and Arg 534 of the enzyme, whereas the pyridine moiety of 8 forms a less productive cation-? interaction. However, unlike 3 or 6 , 8 was found to be able to interact with Asp 465 ( via the pyridine nitrogen) and a water molecule ( via the carbonyl group of 5-iodonicotinamido moiety) in the S1' subpocket (see Supporting Information , Figure 5 ). Those additional interactions likely offset the less productive cation-? interaction geometry of 8 , providing a high-affinity interaction and an imaging agent that gives clear delineation of tumor ( Figure 5 ). While 6 adopts a very similar conformation within the active site to 3 , it binds with lower affinity, likely due to additional interactions of the iodine within the positively-charged arginine patch for 3 . In all, the affinities of 3 , 6 and 8 ( Table 1 ) track with predications based on molecular modeling. Regarding ex vivo biodistribution, [125I] 3 demonstrated only about twice the tumor uptake at 1 h p.i. as [18F] 6 , while its affinity is about twenty-five times higher. The target to nontarget (PSMA+ PC-3PIP:PC-3flu) ratios for [18F] 6 , however, were higher than for [125I] 3 at 0.5 - 1 h p.i., reflecting lower nonspecific binding, however the two compounds are equivalent by 2 h. Target to nontarget ratios rise to approximately 140 at 48 hours p.i. for [125I] 3 and to 35 at 5 hours p.i. for [18F] 6 . Compound [125I] 8 differs from [125I] 3 in that the aromatic ring is a pyridine and the iodine is substituted at the 3-position. At 1 h p.i. [125I] 8 demonstrated a similarly high tumor uptake (12.1 ± 4.9 %ID/g) compared to [125I] 3 , but had a much higher target to nontarget tissue ratio at that time (20), which rose to 47 at 8 h p.i. Compound [125I] 3 took 12 h to reach that ratio. Interestingly, the affinity of [125I] 8 is the lowest among the three compounds tested ( Table 1 ), however, compared with [125I] 3 , it provided a higher target to nontarget ratio at 1 h p.i., equivalent to that of [125I] 3 . As demonstrated in our previous work with 99mTc-labeled compounds of this series, we again show that there is not a clear relationship between affinity and in vivo tumor uptake selectivity. Notably, the affinities of these compounds are quite high ( Table 1 ) and the tumors are clearly delineated ( Figures 3 - 5 ). Based on the in vivo imaging studies, [125I] 3 and [125I] 8 have appropriate pharmacokinetics and imaging characteristics for imaging of PSMA+ prostate cancer with SPECT when radiolabeled with 123I, while [18F] 6 and [124I] 3 would be useful for PET. All compounds demonstrate high target to nontarget tissue ratios relatively soon after injection, making any of them convenient for clinical use. The syntheses are also adaptable to an automated format. Although our previous 18F-labeled inhibitor, [18F]DCFBC 24 , produced higher PSMA+ PC-3 PIP:organ ratios than [18F] 6, [18F] 6 can be prepared in higher radiochemical yield. Additionally, automated syntheses of [18F]SFB, the precursor for [18F] 6 , have been reported suggesting that the radiosynthesis of [18F] 6 may be easier to automate 46 , 47 . Radiation dosimetry and toxicity studies of this latest series of compounds are currently under way.

Reverse phase radio-HPLC purification of [18F] 6 was performed using a Varian Prostar System with a Bioscan Flow Count PMT radioactivity detector. Radioactivity was measured in a Capintec CRC-10R dose calibrator (Ramsey, NJ).

NAALADase Assay NAAG hydrolysis was performed essentially as described previously 31 , 52 . Briefly, LNCaP cell extracts were prepared by sonication in NAALADase buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.4] and 0.5% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were incubated with or without inhibitor at 37°C for 10 min. Following the incubation the radiolabeled substrate N -acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-(3,4-3H)glutamate (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) was added to a final concentration of 30 nM at 37°C for 10-15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 100 mM sodium phosphate and 2 mM EDTA. Products were partitioned by AG 1-X8 formate resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) anion exchange chromatography, eluted with 1 M sodium formate, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Inhibition curves were determined using semilog plots and IC50 values were determined at the concentration at which enzyme activity was inhibited by 50%. Assays were performed in triplicate with the entire inhibition study being repeated at least once to confirm affinity and mode of inhibition. Data were collected during the linear phase of hydrolysis (i.e., < 20% cleavage of total substrate). Enzyme inhibitory constants ( K i values) were generated using the Cheng-Prusoff conversion 53 . Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California). PSMA activity was also determined using a fluorescence-based assay according to a previously reported procedure 32 .

Images were reconstructed using the FORE/2D-OSEM method (2 iterations, 16 subsets) and included corrections for radioactive decay, scanner dead time and scattered radiation. Compound [<sup>125</sup>I]8 PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and PC-3 flu xenograft-bearing SCID mice were injected via the tail vein with 2 ?Ci (74 KBq) of [125I] 8 . Four mice each were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 30, 60, 240 min, 8 and 24 hours p.i. The heart, lungs, liver, stomach, pancreas, spleen, fat, kidney, muscle, small and large intestines, urinary bladder and PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and flu tumors were quickly removed. A 0.1 mL sample of blood was also collected. All organs were weighed and the tissue radioactivity was measured with an automated gamma counter (1282 Compugamma CS, Pharmacia/LKB Nuclear, Inc, Gaithersburg, MD). The %ID/g was calculated by comparison with samples of a standard dilution of the initial dose. All measurements were corrected for decay. A single SCID mouse implanted with a LNCaP xenograft was injected intravenously with 1 mCi (37 MBq) of [125I] 8 in saline. At 4 h p.i. the mouse was anesthetized with isoflurane and maintained under 1% isoflurane in oxygen. The mouse was positioned on the X-SPECT (Gamma Medica, Northridge, CA) gantry and was scanned using two low energy, high-resolution pinhole collimators (Gamma Medica) rotating through 360 ° in 6 ° increments for 45 seconds per increment. All gamma images were reconstructed using LumaGEM software (Gamma Medica, Northridge, CA). Immediately following SPECT acquisition, the mice were then scanned by CT (X-SPECT) over a 4.6 cm field-of-view using a 600 ?A, 50 kV beam. The SPECT and CT data were then coregistered using the supplier's software (Gamma Medica) and displayed using AMIDE ( http://amide.sourceforge.net/ ). Data were reconstructed using the OS-EM algorithm.  Compound [<sup>125</sup>I]3 Xenograft-bearing SCID mice were injected via the tail vein with 2 ?Ci (74 Bq) of [125I] 3 . Four mice each were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 30, 60, 120, 300 min, 12, 24 and 48 hours p.i. The heart, lungs, liver, stomach, pancreas, spleen, fat, kidney, muscle, small and large intestines, urinary bladder and PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and flu tumors were quickly removed. A 0.1 mL sample of blood was also collected. The organs were weighed and the tissue radioactivity was measured with an automated gamma counter (1282 Compugamma CS, Pharmacia/LKB Nuclear, Inc, Gaithersburg, MD). The percent-injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) was calculated by comparison with samples of a standard dilution of the initial dose. All measurements were corrected for decay. A single SCID mouse implanted with both a PSMA+ PC-3 PIP and a PC-3 flu xenograft was injected intravenously with 1 mCi (37 MBq) of [125I] 3 in saline. At 4 h p.i. the mouse was anesthetized with isoflurane and maintained under 1% isoflurane in oxygen.
