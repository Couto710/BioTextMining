A study of micro RNAs in silico and in vivo: Diagnostic and therapeutic applications in cancer There is emerging evidence of abnormal expression in human tumors of microRNAs (miRNAs) which have been assigned oncogenic and/or tumor suppressor functions. While some miRNAs commonly exhibit altered expression across tumors, more often, different tumor types express unique patterns of miRNAs, referable to their tissues of origin. The role of miRNAs in tumorigenesis underscores their value as mechanism-based therapeutic targets in cancer. Similarly, unique patterns of altered microRNA expression provide fingerprints that may serve as molecular biomarkers for tumor diagnosis, classification, prognosis of disease-specific outcomes, and prediction of therapeutic responses.  Summary MicroRNAs represent one fundamental element of the integrated regulation of gene expression underlying nuclear-cytoplasmic communication. Disruption of these regulatory components in processes underlying tumor initiation and promotion contributes to the genetic basis of neoplasia. Beyond molecular mechanisms underlying pathophysiology that constitute therapeutic targets, unique patterns of microRNA expression characterizing lineage dependent tumorigenesis offer unique opportunities to develop biomarkers for diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive management of cancer. These novel discoveries are positioned to launch a transformative continuum linking innovation to patient management. Advancement of these novel paradigm-shifting concepts into patient application will proceed through development and regulatory approval to establish the evidence basis for integration of microRNA-based diagnostics and therapeutics into clinical practice
