Targeted in vivo Imaging of Integrin ? v? 6 with an Improved Radiotracer and its Relevance in a Pancreatic Tumor Model The cell surface receptor ?v?6 is epithelial-specific and its expression is tightly regulated; it is low or undetectable in adult tissues but has been shown to be increased in many different cancers, including pancreatic, cervical, lung, and colon cancer. Studies have described ?v?6 as prognostic biomarker linked to poor survival. We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of imaging ?v?6 in vivo by PET using the peptide [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2. Here we describe improved ?v?6 imaging agents and test their efficacy in a mouse model with endogenous ?v?6-expression. The modified compounds maintained high affinity for ?v?6 and >1000-fold selectivity over related integrins (by ELISA), and demonstrated significantly improved, ?v?6-dependent binding in cell-based assays (>60% binding vs <10% for [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2). In vivo studies using either a melanoma cell line (transduced ?v?6-expression) or the BxPC-3 human pancreatic carcinoma cell line (endogenous ?v?6-expression) revealed that the modified compounds showed significantly improved tumor retention. This, along with good clearance of nonspecifically bound activity, particularly for the new radiotracer [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2, resulted in improved PET-imaging. Tumor/pancreas and tumor/blood biodistribution-ratios of >23:1 and >47:1, respectively, were achieved at 4 h. Significantly, [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 was superior to [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) in imaging the BxPC-3 tumors. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is highly metastatic and current preoperative evaluation of resectability using non-invasive imaging has limited success, with most patients having metastases at time of surgery. The fact that these tumors express ?v?6 suggests that this probe has significant potential for the in vivo detection of this malignancy, thus having important implications for patient care and therapy.  INTRODUCTION In recent years, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG), has become routine for detection of tumors and monitoring of treatment response ( 1 - 3 ). [18F]FDG, a radiolabeled analogue of glucose, is taken up and trapped primarily in cells with high metabolism. As glucose hypermetabolism is commonly found in inflammation as well as in many malignancies, distinguishing cancer from other hypermetabolic states remains a challenge ( 1 , 4 , 5 ). Although PET has been combined with other imaging modalities, most notably computed tomography (CT) which relies on subtle differences in soft tissue density to distinguish between normal and malignant tissues ( 5 - 7 ), [18F]FDG-PET/CT still leaves considerable room for improvement in diagnosis and clinical management of many cancers ( 8 ). The availability of more disease-specific imaging agents ( 7 ) could help to mitigate the limited specificity of [18F]FDG for malignant tissue. Rather than relying on slight changes in tissue density or metabolic rate alone, targeting disease-specific tissue markers could considerably aid in tumor-detection and localization. The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated with [18F]galacto-RGD, a small radiolabeled peptide used for PET imaging of the cancer-related integrin ?v?3 ( 9 ). In contrast to ?v?3, other members of the integrin family have received relatively little attention. However, newly emerging evidence indicates that ?v?6 may also be an important target for diagnosis and treatment of cancer ( 10 - 14 ). The integrin ?v?6 was first identified in a human pancreatic carcinoma cell line ( 15 ). Subsequent studies established that although ?v?6 is epithelial-specific, its expression is low or undetectable in healthy adult tissues. Upregulation has been recognized during tissue remodeling, including inflammation and wound healing ( 16 - 18 ). Significantly, expression has also been shown to be increased in many different cancers ( 13 , 19 ). Among gastroenteropancreatic adenocarcinomas ?v?6-expression was found to be strongest in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) ( 20 ). Moreover, ?v?6 has recently been described as prognostic indicator, with high levels of expression correlating with poor prognosis for cancer of the colon, cervix, lung, and stomach ( 10 - 12 , 21 ). Antibody-blockade of ?v?6 was shown to inhibit tumor progression in vivo in animal models ( 13 ). Thus, mounting evidence implicates ?v?6 as an important and biologically relevant target for molecular imaging of cancer. Recently, we demonstrated the ability to selectively image ?v?6-expressing tumors in vivo with microPET using the ?v?6-specific [18F]fluorobenzoyl labeled peptide [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 ( 22 ). While targeted imaging was achieved, low uptake and poor retention in the target tissue limited its general utility. For this current study, we conjugated small, monodisperse poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymers to A20FMDV2 to improve pharmacokinetics, generating the two new radiotracers [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 and [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2. We report that both PEGylated A20FMDV2 variants showed significantly improved retention in two different ?v?6-expressing human tumor xenograft models: DX3puro?6, a human melanoma cell line transduced to express ?v?6, and BxPC-3, a human pancreatic carcinoma cell line that endogenously expresses ?v?6. In the BxPC-3 model, retention of [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 in tumors was 12-fold greater than retention of the non-PEGylated [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2. Tumor/pancreas and tumor/blood ratios of >23:1 and >47:1, respectively, were achieved with [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 at 4 h. The ability to non-invasively detect regional tumor invasion or occult metastatic disease using ?v?6 PET imaging would have a large impact on patient management, reducing the number of unnecessary surgeries of unresectable disease ( 23 ).  METHODS Reagents and cell lines Reagents, materials and DX3puro/DX3puro?6 cell lines have been described previously ( 22 ). Pancreatic cancer cell lines were obtained from ATCC. Human latency associated peptide (TGF?1-LAP) was purchased from Sigma. A Leica CM1850 cryostat (Leica Microsystems) was used for tissue sectioning. Competitive binding ELISA The in vitro efficacies of the peptides towards integrins ?v?6, ?v?3, ?v?5, ?5?1, and ?IIb?3 were analyzed by competitive binding ELISA as described previously ( 22 ). Flow cytometry Integrin expression on the cell lines was determined as previously described ( 24 ). Cell binding and internalization A cell suspension (3.75 × 106 cells) was incubated with the radiotracer (0.2 ?Ci) in serum free medium (pH 7.2, 100 ?L). For each radiotracer the cell lines were assayed concurrently ( n = 4 samples/cell line/time point). The fraction of bound radioactivity was determined with a ?-counter (cell pellet vs . supernatant). To determine the fraction of internalized radioactivity, the cells were then treated with acidic wash buffer (0.2 mol/L sodium acetate, 0.5 mol/L sodium chloride, pH 2.5, 4°C) to release surface-bound activity ( 25 ). The internalized fraction was determined with a ?-counter (cell pellet vs . radioactivity released into supernatant). Xenograft cell lines and animal model All animal studies were carried out using male athymic nude mice ( nu/nu ; Charles River Laboratories) following approved protocols. DX3puro?6 (?v?6-positive) and DX3puro (control) cells were injected (n = 20 mice; 3 × 106 cells/cell line in 100 ?L serum-free DMEM; Invitrogen) s.c. on opposite flanks in the shoulder region as described previously ( 22 ). BxPC-3 cells were injected (n = 30 mice; 1.5 × 106 cells in 100 ?L 1:1 serum-free DMEM/MatriGel HC; BD Biosciences) s.c. in the left shoulder region. Studies commenced once tumors had reached a diameter of ?0.5 cm. Biodistribution studies Radiotracers (?15 to 30 ?Ci) in saline/PBS (150 to 200 ?L) were administered and data analyzed as previously described (n = 3/time point) ( 22 ). MicroPET imaging studies The [18F]FBA-peptides or [18F]FDG (?120 to 230 ?Ci) in saline/PBS (100 to 200 ?L) were administered as previously described (n = 3/time point) ( 22 ). Two animals were imaged side-by-side in a feet-first prone position. For blocking studies the [19F]FBA-peptide (30 mg/kg as 10 mg/mL solution in saline) was administered 10 min before the radiotracer. Imaging data were collected and analyzed as previously described ( 22 , 26 ). Standard uptake values (SUVs) were computed by dividing the activity concentration in each voxel by the injected dose and then multiplying by the weight of the animal ( 26 ). Maximum intensity projection (MIP) images were created by collapsing across one dimension with the maximum value in each column of voxels. Autoradiography studies Frozen tissue slices (tumor and surrounding tissue, 50 ?m) in freezing medium (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek) were exposed to a storage phosphor-screen (GE Healthcare) over night. The screen was read at 50 ?m resolution using a Storm 860 phosphorimager (GE Healthcare). Statistical analysis The data are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Two-tailed Student’s t -tests were performed to evaluate statistical significance. P <0.05 was considered significant. In plots, the SD is smaller than the size of the symbol for some data points.

RESULTS PEGylated peptide ligands for ?<sub>v</sub>?<sub>6</sub> PEGylated A20FMDV2 variants were compared by ELISA to the established ?v?6 peptide-ligand FBA-A20FMDV2 ( Fig. 1 ). They exhibited IC50 of 3 to 6 nmol/L, similar to FBA-A20FMDV2. Inhibition of binding by the natural ligands to integrins ?v?3, ?v?5, ?5?1, and ?IIb?3 required at least >1000-fold higher concentrations of peptide (IC50 >10 ?mol/L), indicating that introduction of the PEG moieties did not have a deleterious effect on ?v?6 affinity and selectivity of A20FMDV2. Integrin ?<sub>v</sub>?<sub>6</sub> expression in human pancreatic cancer cell lines Seven cell lines were screened by flow cytometry for ?v?6-expression ( Fig. 2 ). For reference, the melanoma cell lines DX3puro?6, stably transduced to express ?v?6, and its paired control line DX3puro, lacking expression of ?v?6, were analyzed as positive and negative control, respectively; both of these cell lines express similar levels of other integrins, including ?v?3, ?v?5, and ?5?1 ( 22 ). BxPC-3 and Capan-2 showed high ?v?6 expression levels, comparable to that of the positive control DX3puro?6. Capan-1 and L3.3 showed intermediate expression of ?v?6, while MIA-PaCa2, Panc-1, and BCL-2cl9 demonstrated expression levels equivalent to that of the negative control DX3puro. Cell binding and internalization Binding of the radiotracers [18F]FBA-(PEG28)n-A20FMDV2 (n = 0, 1, 2; Supplementary Fig. S1 , S2 ; ( 22 )) to DX3puro?6, DX3puro, and BxPC-3 cell lines was strongly dependent on the expression of ?v?6 by the cells and on the presence of a PEG unit in the radiotracer ( Fig. 3 ). Whereas less than 2% of any radiotracer bound to the ?v?6-negative DX3puro within one hour ( Fig 3 A ), 5.3 ± 0.8% and 9.7 ± 1.2% of [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 bound to the ?v?6-expressing DX3puro?6 and BxPC-3 cell lines, respectively. For [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 the binding levels increased significantly to 73.5 ± 1.3% and 68.9 ± 0.2%, respectively. Similarly, [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 showed markedly elevated binding levels of 38.5 ± 1.7% and 25.8 ± 0.6%, respectively. Approximately two-thirds of the bound radioactivity was internalized in the ?v?6-expressing cell lines in the case of the two PEGylated radiotracers, while less than half of the bound [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 was internalized. Incubation in the presence of excess non-radioactive [19F]FBA-PEG28A20FMDV2 (?1?mol/L) completely abrogated binding of the radiotracer to DX3puro?6 cells ( Supplementary Fig S3 ). Figure 3 B illustrates the rapid cell binding of radiotracer. Within one minute, approximately one quarter of [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 bound to DX3puro?6 and BxPC-3 (30.5 ± 2.7% and 24.5 ± 1.2%, respectively). Binding levels approached their maximum within 15 to 30 minutes and then remained steady. When the two cell lines were incubated with [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 for 1 hour in the presence of latency associated peptide (LAP), the radiotracer was able to efficiently compete for binding: binding levels in presence of 5 nmol/L LAP remained at ?75% of those observed under LAP-free conditions ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). [<sup>18</sup>F]FBA-(PEG<sub>28</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-A20FMDV2 (n = 0, 1, 2) biodistribution in the DX3puro/DX3puro?6 model Initial in vivo evaluation of [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 and [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 was performed using our previously described mouse model bearing the paired human xenografts of DX3puro?6 (?v?6-positive) and DX3puro (?v?6-negative) ( Supplementary Table S1 ). While uptake of both PEGylated radiotracers in the target tissue at 1 h post-injection (p.i.) was slightly below the level previously seen for the non-PEGylated [18F]FBA-A20FMDV ( 22 ), the introduction of the PEG unit(s) resulted in excellent retention of radioactivity in the ?v?6-positive tumor ([18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 0.49 ± 0.12% ID/g, 4 h: 0.49 ± 0.04% ID/g; [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 0.52 ± 0.09% ID/g, 4 h: 0.54 ± 0.08% ID/g; compared with [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 0.66 ± 0.09% ID/g, 4 h: 0.06 ± 0.00% ID/g). A comparison of uptake in the two xenografts consistently showed preferential uptake in the ?v?6-positive xenograft over the ?v?6-negative xenograft, particularly for the PEGylated radiotracers. While [18F]FBA-A20FMDV resulted in a 4.3:1 maximal ?v?6-positive/-negative ratio, ratios of 8.0:1 and 9.2:1 were seen for [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 and [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2, respectively ( P -values: see Supplementary Table S1 ). [<sup>18</sup>F]FBA-(PEG<sub>28</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-A20FMDV2 (n = 0, 1, 2) biodistribution in the ?<sub>v</sub>?<sub>6</sub>-endogenous BxPC-3 model The feasibility of ?v?6-targeted pancreatic tumor detection in vivo was evaluated in the BxPC-3 mouse model ( Fig. 4 , Supplementary Table S1 ). For [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 initial uptake in and washout from the BxPC-3 xenograft (1 h: 0.69 ± 0.19% ID/g, 4 h: 0.12 ± 0.03% ID/g) were similar to those seen in the DX3puro?6 xenograft (1 h: 0.66 ± 0.09% ID/g, 4 h: 0.06 ± 0.00% ID/g). By contrast, for both of the PEGylated radiotracers uptake in the BxPC-3 xenograft 1 h after injection was three to four times higher than in the DX3puro?6 xenograft, combined with excellent retention ([18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 1.85 ± 0.44% ID/g, 4 h: 1.48 ± 0.04% ID/g; [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 1.57 ± 0.25% ID/g, 4 h: 2.08 ± 0.37% ID/g). Autoradiography images obtained for the PEGylated radiotracers of BxPC-3 xenografts 1 h after injection also showed preferential, tumor specific uptake ( Fig. 5 ). Renal clearance was the major route of elimination for all three radiotracers ( Fig. 4 , and data not shown). HPLC analyses of urine samples showed three metabolites for [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2, and one major metabolite for each of the PEGylated radiotracers. Distribution of the radiotracers in healthy tissues generally depended on the number of PEG units present ( Figure 4 , Supplementary Table S1 ). Non-PEGylated [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 was washed out efficiently from all tissues examined, with gall bladder and kidneys containing highest levels of radioactivity. By contrast, the diPEGylated [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 was generally retained throughout, most notably in the kidneys (?42% ID/g); only blood showed clearing of radioactivity. Pharmacokinetics of the monoPEGylated [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 in healthy tissues compared favorably to the diPEGylated radiotracer, resulting in a desirable clearing behavior resembling that observed for the non-PEGylated compound in healthy tissues; highest levels of radioactivity were detected in the kidneys and the gall bladder. The BxPC-3/blood ratio remained relatively low for [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 (1 h: 3.3:1, 4 h: 7.0:1) and the BxPC-3/muscle ratio only reached statistically significant levels at the 4 h time point (1 h: 1.3:1, P = 0.38; 4 h: 2.5:1, P = 0.02) because of more rapid washout from healthy tissues than from the tumor ( Fig. 4 , Supplementary Table S1 ). By comparison, improved BxPC-3/muscle ratios were seen for [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 (1 h: 2.5:1, 4 h: 3.6:1) and [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 (1 h: 4.1:1, 4 h: 4.4:1), along with significantly higher BxPC-3/blood ratios ([18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 11.8:1, 4 h: 47.9:1; [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 9.0:1, 4 h: 150:1), reflecting the improved retention of these radiotracers in the BxPC-3 tumor. Importantly, levels of radioactivity in the BxPC-3 tumor were at least 4-fold higher than those for the pancreas itself for all radiotracers at all time points measured ( Supplementary Table S1 ). For [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 the BxPC-3/pancreas ratio rose to 9.5:1 at 4 h p.i. due to more efficient washout from the pancreas than from the tumor. On the other hand, because of retention of [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 in healthy pancreas, the BxPC-3/pancreas ratio for this radiotracer remained nearly unchanged throughout (1 h: 5.6:1, 4 h: 4.4:1). [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 exhibited good retention in the tumor together with efficient washout from the pancreas (and other healthy tissues), resulting in a steadily increasing BxPC-3/pancreas ratio (1 h: 4.2:1, 4 h: 23.6:1). In summary, the monoPEGylated [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 had the most favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics. MicroPET imaging of the ?<sub>v</sub>?<sub>6</sub>-endogenous BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer model Figure 5 A depicts representative coronal and transaxial maximum intensity projections (MIPs) obtained with the three [18F]FBA-peptide tracers and with [18F]FDG (1 h p.i.). Tumor uptake was compared based on maximum standard uptake values (SUVmax; n = 3 animals). The observations made for the peptide radiotracers during microPET imaging paralleled the results seen in the biodistribution study with preferential uptake noted in the tumor along with major uptake in kidneys, bladder (urine), and, for [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2, gall bladder. [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 showed moderate initial tumor uptake and significant washout over time (SUVmax, 15min: 0.50 ± 0.22, 1 h: 0.22 ± 0.11; 4 h: < 0.05). [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 showed improved uptake and retention in the tumor (SUVmax, 15min: 0.99 ± 0.18, 1 h: 0.79 ± 0.24, 4 h: 0.59 ± 0.20), along with significant renal retention. [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 combined favorable tumor uptake characteristics (SUVmax, 15min: 1.07 ± 0.29, 1 h: 0.91 ± 0.25, 4 h: 0.63 ± 0.12) with good renal clearance. Administration of non-radioactive [19F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 (30 mg/kg) ten minutes prior to the corresponding [18F]FBA-peptide greatly reduced BxPC-3 tumor uptake (?(SUVmax) = -77%; Fig. 5 B ). Similar results were obtained for FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 (30 mg/kg)/[18F]FBA-peptide (?(SUVmax) = -60%; Fig. 5 C ). Interestingly, [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 and [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 were retained in the mouse oral cavity in scans without prior administration of non-radioactive FBA-peptide, suggesting that there may be limited expression of ?v?6 ( 27 ). MicroPET scans obtained with [18F]FDG revealed an SUVmax of 0.62 ± 0.13 in the BxPC-3 tumor (1 h p.i.; n = 3; Fig. 5 A ). This level of tumor uptake is relatively low for [18F]FDG and it was within the range observed for the surrounding tissue (?0.4 to 0.8). Thus, while the [18F]FBA-peptide tracers clearly revealed the BxPC-3 tumor in vivo , [18F]FDG did not.

[<sup>18</sup>F]FBA-(PEG<sub>28</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-A20FMDV2 (n = 0, 1, 2) biodistribution in the DX3puro/DX3puro?6 model Initial in vivo evaluation of [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 and [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 was performed using our previously described mouse model bearing the paired human xenografts of DX3puro?6 (?v?6-positive) and DX3puro (?v?6-negative) ( Supplementary Table S1 ). While uptake of both PEGylated radiotracers in the target tissue at 1 h post-injection (p.i.) was slightly below the level previously seen for the non-PEGylated [18F]FBA-A20FMDV ( 22 ), the introduction of the PEG unit(s) resulted in excellent retention of radioactivity in the ?v?6-positive tumor ([18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 0.49 ± 0.12% ID/g, 4 h: 0.49 ± 0.04% ID/g; [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 0.52 ± 0.09% ID/g, 4 h: 0.54 ± 0.08% ID/g; compared with [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 0.66 ± 0.09% ID/g, 4 h: 0.06 ± 0.00% ID/g). A comparison of uptake in the two xenografts consistently showed preferential uptake in the ?v?6-positive xenograft over the ?v?6-negative xenograft, particularly for the PEGylated radiotracers. While [18F]FBA-A20FMDV resulted in a 4.3:1 maximal ?v?6-positive/-negative ratio, ratios of 8.0:1 and 9.2:1 were seen for [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 and [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2, respectively ( P -values: see Supplementary Table S1 ). [<sup>18</sup>F]FBA-(PEG<sub>28</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-A20FMDV2 (n = 0, 1, 2) biodistribution in the ?<sub>v</sub>?<sub>6</sub>-endogenous BxPC-3 model The feasibility of ?v?6-targeted pancreatic tumor detection in vivo was evaluated in the BxPC-3 mouse model ( Fig. 4 , Supplementary Table S1 ). For [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 initial uptake in and washout from the BxPC-3 xenograft (1 h: 0.69 ± 0.19% ID/g, 4 h: 0.12 ± 0.03% ID/g) were similar to those seen in the DX3puro?6 xenograft (1 h: 0.66 ± 0.09% ID/g, 4 h: 0.06 ± 0.00% ID/g). By contrast, for both of the PEGylated radiotracers uptake in the BxPC-3 xenograft 1 h after injection was three to four times higher than in the DX3puro?6 xenograft, combined with excellent retention ([18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 1.85 ± 0.44% ID/g, 4 h: 1.48 ± 0.04% ID/g; [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 1.57 ± 0.25% ID/g, 4 h: 2.08 ± 0.37% ID/g). Autoradiography images obtained for the PEGylated radiotracers of BxPC-3 xenografts 1 h after injection also showed preferential, tumor specific uptake ( Fig. 5 ). Renal clearance was the major route of elimination for all three radiotracers ( Fig. 4 , and data not shown). HPLC analyses of urine samples showed three metabolites for [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2, and one major metabolite for each of the PEGylated radiotracers. Distribution of the radiotracers in healthy tissues generally depended on the number of PEG units present ( Figure 4 , Supplementary Table S1 ). Non-PEGylated [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 was washed out efficiently from all tissues examined, with gall bladder and kidneys containing highest levels of radioactivity. By contrast, the diPEGylated [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 was generally retained throughout, most notably in the kidneys (?42% ID/g); only blood showed clearing of radioactivity. Pharmacokinetics of the monoPEGylated [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 in healthy tissues compared favorably to the diPEGylated radiotracer, resulting in a desirable clearing behavior resembling that observed for the non-PEGylated compound in healthy tissues; highest levels of radioactivity were detected in the kidneys and the gall bladder. The BxPC-3/blood ratio remained relatively low for [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 (1 h: 3.3:1, 4 h: 7.0:1) and the BxPC-3/muscle ratio only reached statistically significant levels at the 4 h time point (1 h: 1.3:1, P = 0.38; 4 h: 2.5:1, P = 0.02) because of more rapid washout from healthy tissues than from the tumor ( Fig. 4 , Supplementary Table S1 ). By comparison, improved BxPC-3/muscle ratios were seen for [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 (1 h: 2.5:1, 4 h: 3.6:1) and [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 (1 h: 4.1:1, 4 h: 4.4:1), along with significantly higher BxPC-3/blood ratios ([18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 11.8:1, 4 h: 47.9:1; [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 9.0:1, 4 h: 150:1), reflecting the improved retention of these radiotracers in the BxPC-3 tumor. Importantly, levels of radioactivity in the BxPC-3 tumor were at least 4-fold higher than those for the pancreas itself for all radiotracers at all time points measured ( Supplementary Table S1 ). For [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 the BxPC-3/pancreas ratio rose to 9.5:1 at 4 h p.i. due to more efficient washout from the pancreas than from the tumor. On the other hand, because of retention of [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 in healthy pancreas, the BxPC-3/pancreas ratio for this radiotracer remained nearly unchanged throughout (1 h: 5.6:1, 4 h: 4.4:1). [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 exhibited good retention in the tumor together with efficient washout from the pancreas (and other healthy tissues), resulting in a steadily increasing BxPC-3/pancreas ratio (1 h: 4.2:1, 4 h: 23.6:1). In summary, the monoPEGylated [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 had the most favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics. MicroPET imaging of the ?<sub>v</sub>?<sub>6</sub>-endogenous BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer model Figure 5 A depicts representative coronal and transaxial maximum intensity projections (MIPs) obtained with the three [18F]FBA-peptide tracers and with [18F]FDG (1 h p.i.). Tumor uptake was compared based on maximum standard uptake values (SUVmax; n = 3 animals). The observations made for the peptide radiotracers during microPET imaging paralleled the results seen in the biodistribution study with preferential uptake noted in the tumor along with major uptake in kidneys, bladder (urine), and, for [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2, gall bladder. [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 showed moderate initial tumor uptake and significant washout over time (SUVmax, 15min: 0.50 ± 0.22, 1 h: 0.22 ± 0.11; 4 h: < 0.05). [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 showed improved uptake and retention in the tumor (SUVmax, 15min: 0.99 ± 0.18, 1 h: 0.79 ± 0.24, 4 h: 0.59 ± 0.20), along with significant renal retention. [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 combined favorable tumor uptake characteristics (SUVmax, 15min: 1.07 ± 0.29, 1 h: 0.91 ± 0.25, 4 h: 0.63 ± 0.12) with good renal clearance. Administration of non-radioactive [19F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 (30 mg/kg) ten minutes prior to the corresponding [18F]FBA-peptide greatly reduced BxPC-3 tumor uptake (?(SUVmax) = -77%; Fig. 5 B ). Similar results were obtained for FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 (30 mg/kg)/[18F]FBA-peptide (?(SUVmax) = -60%; Fig. 5 C ). Interestingly, [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 and [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 were retained in the mouse oral cavity in scans without prior administration of non-radioactive FBA-peptide, suggesting that there may be limited expression of ?v?6 ( 27 ). MicroPET scans obtained with [18F]FDG revealed an SUVmax of 0.62 ± 0.13 in the BxPC-3 tumor (1 h p.i.; n = 3; Fig. 5 A ). This level of tumor uptake is relatively low for [18F]FDG and it was within the range observed for the surrounding tissue (?0.4 to 0.8). Thus, while the [18F]FBA-peptide tracers clearly revealed the BxPC-3 tumor in vivo , [18F]FDG did not.  PEGylated peptide ligands for ?<sub>v</sub>?<sub>6</sub> PEGylated A20FMDV2 variants were compared by ELISA to the established ?v?6 peptide-ligand FBA-A20FMDV2 ( Fig. 1 ). They exhibited IC50 of 3 to 6 nmol/L, similar to FBA-A20FMDV2. Inhibition of binding by the natural ligands to integrins ?v?3, ?v?5, ?5?1, and ?IIb?3 required at least >1000-fold higher concentrations of peptide (IC50 >10 ?mol/L), indicating that introduction of the PEG moieties did not have a deleterious effect on ?v?6 affinity and selectivity of A20FMDV2.

Integrin ?<sub>v</sub>?<sub>6</sub> expression in human pancreatic cancer cell lines Seven cell lines were screened by flow cytometry for ?v?6-expression ( Fig. 2 ). For reference, the melanoma cell lines DX3puro?6, stably transduced to express ?v?6, and its paired control line DX3puro, lacking expression of ?v?6, were analyzed as positive and negative control, respectively; both of these cell lines express similar levels of other integrins, including ?v?3, ?v?5, and ?5?1 ( 22 ). BxPC-3 and Capan-2 showed high ?v?6 expression levels, comparable to that of the positive control DX3puro?6. Capan-1 and L3.3 showed intermediate expression of ?v?6, while MIA-PaCa2, Panc-1, and BCL-2cl9 demonstrated expression levels equivalent to that of the negative control DX3puro.

Cell binding and internalization Binding of the radiotracers [18F]FBA-(PEG28)n-A20FMDV2 (n = 0, 1, 2; Supplementary Fig. S1 , S2 ; ( 22 )) to DX3puro?6, DX3puro, and BxPC-3 cell lines was strongly dependent on the expression of ?v?6 by the cells and on the presence of a PEG unit in the radiotracer ( Fig. 3 ). Whereas less than 2% of any radiotracer bound to the ?v?6-negative DX3puro within one hour ( Fig 3 A ), 5.3 ± 0.8% and 9.7 ± 1.2% of [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 bound to the ?v?6-expressing DX3puro?6 and BxPC-3 cell lines, respectively. For [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 the binding levels increased significantly to 73.5 ± 1.3% and 68.9 ± 0.2%, respectively. Similarly, [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 showed markedly elevated binding levels of 38.5 ± 1.7% and 25.8 ± 0.6%, respectively. Approximately two-thirds of the bound radioactivity was internalized in the ?v?6-expressing cell lines in the case of the two PEGylated radiotracers, while less than half of the bound [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 was internalized. Incubation in the presence of excess non-radioactive [19F]FBA-PEG28A20FMDV2 (?1?mol/L) completely abrogated binding of the radiotracer to DX3puro?6 cells ( Supplementary Fig S3 ). Figure 3 B illustrates the rapid cell binding of radiotracer. Within one minute, approximately one quarter of [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 bound to DX3puro?6 and BxPC-3 (30.5 ± 2.7% and 24.5 ± 1.2%, respectively). Binding levels approached their maximum within 15 to 30 minutes and then remained steady. When the two cell lines were incubated with [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 for 1 hour in the presence of latency associated peptide (LAP), the radiotracer was able to efficiently compete for binding: binding levels in presence of 5 nmol/L LAP remained at ?75% of those observed under LAP-free conditions ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ).

While uptake of both PEGylated radiotracers in the target tissue at 1 h post-injection (p.i.) was slightly below the level previously seen for the non-PEGylated [18F]FBA-A20FMDV ( 22 ), the introduction of the PEG unit(s) resulted in excellent retention of radioactivity in the ?v?6-positive tumor ([18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 0.49 ± 0.12% ID/g, 4 h: 0.49 ± 0.04% ID/g; [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 0.52 ± 0.09% ID/g, 4 h: 0.54 ± 0.08% ID/g; compared with [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 0.66 ± 0.09% ID/g, 4 h: 0.06 ± 0.00% ID/g). A comparison of uptake in the two xenografts consistently showed preferential uptake in the ?v?6-positive xenograft over the ?v?6-negative xenograft, particularly for the PEGylated radiotracers.

Autoradiography images obtained for the PEGylated radiotracers of BxPC-3 xenografts 1 h after injection also showed preferential, tumor specific uptake ( Fig. 5 ). Renal clearance was the major route of elimination for all three radiotracers ( Fig. 4 , and data not shown). HPLC analyses of urine samples showed three metabolites for [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2, and one major metabolite for each of the PEGylated radiotracers.

By comparison, improved BxPC-3/muscle ratios were seen for [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 (1 h: 2.5:1, 4 h: 3.6:1) and [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 (1 h: 4.1:1, 4 h: 4.4:1), along with significantly higher BxPC-3/blood ratios ([18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 11.8:1, 4 h: 47.9:1; [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2, 1 h: 9.0:1, 4 h: 150:1), reflecting the improved retention of these radiotracers in the BxPC-3 tumor. Importantly, levels of radioactivity in the BxPC-3 tumor were at least 4-fold higher than those for the pancreas itself for all radiotracers at all time points measured ( Supplementary Table S1 ). For [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 the BxPC-3/pancreas ratio rose to 9.5:1 at 4 h p.i. due to more efficient washout from the pancreas than from the tumor. On the other hand, because of retention of [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 in healthy pancreas, the BxPC-3/pancreas ratio for this radiotracer remained nearly unchanged throughout (1 h: 5.6:1, 4 h: 4.4:1). [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 exhibited good retention in the tumor together with efficient washout from the pancreas (and other healthy tissues), resulting in a steadily increasing BxPC-3/pancreas ratio (1 h: 4.2:1, 4 h: 23.6:1). In summary, the monoPEGylated [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 had the most favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics.  MicroPET imaging of the ?<sub>v</sub>?<sub>6</sub>-endogenous BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer model Figure 5 A depicts representative coronal and transaxial maximum intensity projections (MIPs) obtained with the three [18F]FBA-peptide tracers and with [18F]FDG (1 h p.i.). Tumor uptake was compared based on maximum standard uptake values (SUVmax; n = 3 animals). The observations made for the peptide radiotracers during microPET imaging paralleled the results seen in the biodistribution study with preferential uptake noted in the tumor along with major uptake in kidneys, bladder (urine), and, for [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2, gall bladder. [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 showed moderate initial tumor uptake and significant washout over time (SUVmax, 15min: 0.50 ± 0.22, 1 h: 0.22 ± 0.11; 4 h: < 0.05). [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 showed improved uptake and retention in the tumor (SUVmax, 15min: 0.99 ± 0.18, 1 h: 0.79 ± 0.24, 4 h: 0.59 ± 0.20), along with significant renal retention. [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 combined favorable tumor uptake characteristics (SUVmax, 15min: 1.07 ± 0.29, 1 h: 0.91 ± 0.25, 4 h: 0.63 ± 0.12) with good renal clearance. Administration of non-radioactive [19F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 (30 mg/kg) ten minutes prior to the corresponding [18F]FBA-peptide greatly reduced BxPC-3 tumor uptake (?(SUVmax) = -77%; Fig. 5 B ). Similar results were obtained for FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 (30 mg/kg)/[18F]FBA-peptide (?(SUVmax) = -60%; Fig. 5 C ). Interestingly, [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 and [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 were retained in the mouse oral cavity in scans without prior administration of non-radioactive FBA-peptide, suggesting that there may be limited expression of ?v?6 ( 27 ). MicroPET scans obtained with [18F]FDG revealed an SUVmax of 0.62 ± 0.13 in the BxPC-3 tumor (1 h p.i.; n = 3; Fig. 5 A ). This level of tumor uptake is relatively low for [18F]FDG and it was within the range observed for the surrounding tissue (?0.4 to 0.8). Thus, while the [18F]FBA-peptide tracers clearly revealed the BxPC-3 tumor in vivo , [18F]FDG did not.  MicroPET imaging of the ?<sub>v</sub>?<sub>6</sub>-endogenous BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer model Figure 5 A depicts representative coronal and transaxial maximum intensity projections (MIPs) obtained with the three [18F]FBA-peptide tracers and with [18F]FDG (1 h p.i.).

The observations made for the peptide radiotracers during microPET imaging paralleled the results seen in the biodistribution study with preferential uptake noted in the tumor along with major uptake in kidneys, bladder (urine), and, for [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2, gall bladder. [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 showed moderate initial tumor uptake and significant washout over time (SUVmax, 15min: 0.50 ± 0.22, 1 h: 0.22 ± 0.11; 4 h: < 0.05). [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 showed improved uptake and retention in the tumor (SUVmax, 15min: 0.99 ± 0.18, 1 h: 0.79 ± 0.24, 4 h: 0.59 ± 0.20), along with significant renal retention. [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 combined favorable tumor uptake characteristics (SUVmax, 15min: 1.07 ± 0.29, 1 h: 0.91 ± 0.25, 4 h: 0.63 ± 0.12) with good renal clearance. Administration of non-radioactive [19F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 (30 mg/kg) ten minutes prior to the corresponding [18F]FBA-peptide greatly reduced BxPC-3 tumor uptake (?(SUVmax) = -77%; Fig. 5 B ). Similar results were obtained for FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 (30 mg/kg)/[18F]FBA-peptide (?(SUVmax) = -60%; Fig. 5 C ). Interestingly, [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 and [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 were retained in the mouse oral cavity in scans without prior administration of non-radioactive FBA-peptide, suggesting that there may be limited expression of ?v?6 ( 27 ). MicroPET scans obtained with [18F]FDG revealed an SUVmax of 0.62 ± 0.13 in the BxPC-3 tumor (1 h p.i.; n = 3; Fig. 5 A ). This level of tumor uptake is relatively low for [18F]FDG and it was within the range observed for the surrounding tissue (?0.4 to 0.8). Thus, while the [18F]FBA-peptide tracers clearly revealed the BxPC-3 tumor in vivo , [18F]FDG did not.  DISCUSSION The integrin ?v?6 has been identified as prognostic biomarker for cancer of the colon, cervix, lung, and stomach ( 10 - 12 , 21 ). In addition, ?v?6 is reported to be expressed by many other types of carcinoma ( 13 , 19 ) whereas corresponding normal tissue is weak or negative. Thus ?v?6 represents an excellent target for imaging and therapy of carcinoma. We previously demonstrated the ability to selectively image ?v?6-expressing tumors in vivo using the PET radiotracer [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 ( 22 ). While targeted imaging was achieved, low uptake and poor retention in the target tissue together with metabolic instability limited its general utility, leading us to explore strategies to improve pharmacokinetics. As introduction of PEG-moieties (PEGylation) generally increases the biological half-life, metabolic stability, and tumor-uptake ( 28 , 29 ) we generated two variants of A20FMDV2 that included PEG-moieties on the N-terminus of the peptide. These PEGylated variants of [18F]FBA-A20FMDV2 were examined and compared with the parent compound. Monodisperse PEG polymers of moderate molecular weight (Fw(PEG28) = 1.3 kDa) are short enough to be compatible with solid-phase chemistries, yet large enough to be expected to approach a range with some beneficial in vivo (pharmacokinetic) properties. Additionally, owing to the monodisperse nature of the polymer, the final product is obtained as a single compound, allowing for precise characterization and batch-to-batch reproducibility, in contrast to mixtures containing polymer-chains of different lengths encountered with the larger PEG products available. As presented here, initial in vitro evaluation by ELISA indicated unchanged, high ?v?6-specificity for the PEGylated compounds ( Fig. 1 ). Further binding experiments with the DX3puro?6 and DX3puro cell lines demonstrated strong, ?v?6-specific and PEG-dependent binding to the receptor expressed on cells in the presence of other, related integrins (including ?v?3, ?v?5, and ?5?1) ( Fig. 3 ). In vivo studies also showed improved, ?v?6-targeted PEG-dependent tumor-retention in the DX3puro?6/DX3puro model ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Taken together, these data confirmed our initial expectations for the two new PEGylated radiotracers, [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 and [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2. The DX3puro?6/DX3puro melanoma cancer model was generated by viral transduction of human ?6 into human melanoma cells. In order to examine a model more closely resembling the actual human disease, we sought a cancer where expression of ?v?6 was relevant to the disease and for which cell lines existed that had endogenous expression of ?v?6; we chose to investigate pancreatic cancer. Sipos et al ( 20 ) reported as part of a study of gastroenteropancreatic adenocarcinomas that ?v?6 expression was strongest in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). Thus of the 34 human PDAC samples analyzed 32 (94%) received the maximum score (the mean score was 2.8/3.0, with none of the other carcinomas receiving a score over 1.5). These observations make ?v?6 a very appealing target for selective in vivo detection of pancreatic cancer. The possibility of detecting primary tumors and metastases earlier by imaging ?v?6, and thus directing therapy sooner, may improve upon the very poor prognosis of this disease. In addition, recent studies associate strong expression of ?v?6 with poor prognosis (for colon, lung, cervical, and stomach cancer) ( 10 - 12 , 21 ), so the relevance of our data is not restricted only to pancreatic cancer. As demonstrated here by flow cytometry ( Fig. 2 ), many common pancreatic carcinoma cell lines exhibit an ?v?6 profile that reflects expression seen for PDAC in the clinic ( 20 ). In vitro cell binding assays showed that [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 performed equally well with the endogenously ?v?6-expressing pancreatic BxPC-3 cell line and the transduced ?v?6-expressing DX3puro?6 cell line, demonstrating rapid and high binding together with significant internalization ( Fig. 3 ). Contrary to conditions in the in vivo environment, these assays were performed in the absence of natural ligands competing for binding to ?v?6. We therefore sought to further demonstrate their relevance as predictors for in vivo performance by carrying out a binding assay in the presence of a biologically relevant ?v?6 ligand. Latency associated peptide (LAP) was chosen as it binds to ?v?6 with high affinity and has significance in the context of tumor biology ( 13 , 18 , 30 ). In association with transforming growth factor ? (TGF?), particularly TGF?1, LAP binds to ?v?6, thereby affecting signaling pathways understood to play significant roles in tumor development ( 18 , 30 ). We found that even in the presence of 5 nmol/L LAP, the radiotracer, present at sub-picomolar levels, was still able to efficiently bind to the cells (at ?75% of binding observed under LAP-free conditions. Supplementary Fig. S4 ). The feasibility of evaluating ?v?6-specific in vivo imaging radiotracers for pancreatic carcinoma was shown in a mouse model bearing BxPC-3 xenografts. In microPET images the BxPC-3 tumors were clearly identifiable throughout. These data confirm that selective in vivo imaging of ?v?6-expressing cancers is possible with cancers that endogenously express ?v?6 and not only those engineered to express it. Importantly for pancreatic imaging the best pharmacokinetic behavior was observed for [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2, resulting in the highest tumor/pancreas ratio (>23:1; 4 h), making this radiotracer a promising lead compound for in vivo detection. Close examination of the biodistribution data revealed that introduction of the second PEG unit was not beneficial. Simply modifying from [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 to [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 resulted only in a slight increase in tumor uptake while, concurrently, washout of radioactivity from healthy tissue (except blood) was suppressed over the time span examined; particularly notable are the high and constant levels of radioactivity in the kidneys ( Fig. 4 ). PET images also demonstrated that [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 outperformed [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2; it showed slightly higher uptake (SUVmax) together with better BxPC-3/background ratios, largely due to preferential clearing of nonspecifically bound activity ( Fig. 5 ). Thus, in this study, [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 appeared to have the best balance of ?v?6-dependent tumor uptake and a suitable rate of clearance from healthy tissues, including the pancreas. The high retention of [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2 in healthy tissues, caused by introduction of the second PEG unit, had not been predicted. These observations appear to stand in contrast to the common belief that renal clearance remains highly efficient for compounds bearing small PEG units (under ?30 kDa) ( 28 , 29 ). Despite the comparatively small PEG units employed in this study, the PEGylation of A20FMDV2 appeared to result in an ‘enhanced permeation and retention’ (EPR) effect towards the BxPC-3 tumors along with some improved radiotracer stability ( 29 ). Positive effects of PEGylation on the in vivo stability of pharmaceuticals are generally recognized ( 28 ). Likewise, in our study only one major radioactive metabolite was found in HPLC samples of urine collected 1 h after injection of [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 or [18F]FBA-(PEG28)2-A20FMDV2, while the non-PEGylated analogue had yielded three equally large metabolite-signals ( 22 ). However, since the cell-based assays demonstrated very rapid binding (?25% of [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 bound to BxPC-3 within one minute, Fig 3 B ) and significant, PEG-dependent internalization (approximately two-thirds of bound activity were internalized at 1 hour, Fig 3 A ), delivery efficiency to the target likely was of principal importance for these radiotracers, provided that radioactive metabolites were rapidly cleared from the body, as observed particularly for [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2. Taken together, these data suggest that rapid binding and internalization of the PEGylated radiotracers in cells are key to increased uptake and retention in the tumors. That being said, a detailed characterization of metabolites and further modification of the radiotracers remain of interest. They include selective deletion of redundant amino acids and replacement with unnatural amino acids in conjunction with multimeric radiotracers and incorporation of branched PEG. These approaches have already been successful in improving the pharmacokinetics of tracers for integrin ?v?3 ( 28 , 31 , 32 ). Paralleling the in vitro blocking studies with the ?v?6-expressing cell lines, in vivo blocking experiments with the non-radioactive analogues showed a significant reduction of uptake in the BxPC-3 tumors. Prior to the blocking experiments the animals were also evaluated by [18F]FDG-PET, the standard radiotracer for PET imaging. Significantly, [18F]FDG failed in all animals to detect the BxPC-3 tumors. In the clinical setting [18F]FDG is by far the most widely used PET radiotracer for the detection of many cancers, including pancreatic cancer, despite the risk of false positive (eg. pancreatitis) or false negative (eg. low GLUT-1 glucose transporter expression in tumor; hyperglycemic patient) diagnosis. Thus, our observation parallels findings from the clinical setting where [18F]FDG is estimated to miss over one third of all pancretic malignancies (and about half of the lesions smaller than 1 cm) ( 6 , 8 , 33 ). Better understanding of the biology of pancreatic cancer ( 34 ) and improved early, more accurate diagnosis are sorely needed. By combining detailed anatomical information with functional metabolic information [18F]FDG-PET/CT has shown some promise ( 5 , 6 , 8 , 33 ). However, the use of [18F]FDG as radiotracer does not take advantage of the molecular biological differences of tumors beyond their increased (glucose) metabolism. The integrin ?v?6 is expressed strongly by most human pancreatic cancers ( 20 ) and is likely to be a prognostic indicator for this cancer. Therefore, it is clear that targeted in vivo imaging of ?v?6 will be a major improvement for preoperative staging and monitoring response to treatment for this lethal malignancy in humans. Using a metabolic marker ([18F]FDG) in conjunction with receptor-specific radiotracers in PET/CT could provide crucial additional information, particularly for occult disease. In a step towards making this a clinical reality we have shown that [18F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 holds promise for ?v?6-specific tumor imaging.  DISCUSSION The integrin ?v?6 has been identified as prognostic biomarker for cancer of the colon, cervix, lung, and stomach ( 10 - 12 , 21 ).

Data were obtained 1, 2, and 4 hours after i.v. injection of the radiotracer ( n = 3/time point/radiotracer) for the BxPC-3 tumor, pancreas ( A ); muscle, blood ( B ); kidneys ( C ); gall bladder, and liver ( D ). For all three radiotracers and time points, the corresponding differences in uptake in BxPC-3 vs pancreas were statistically significant ( A ; P -values: see Supplementary Table S1 ). Figure 5 In vivo evaluation of radiotracers in BxPC-3 xenograft bearing male nu/nu mice using microPET ( A-C ), as well as autoradiography ( D ). A , Representative coronal and transaxial maximum intensity projections (MIPs) obtained in the same animal after bolus injection of the radiotracers into the tail vein. For all [18F]FBA-peptides the first 4 panels were obtained as part of a dynamic 4 × 15 min scan started 15 min after injection. Subsequent panels depict 15 min scans at 2 h and 4 h after injection, respectively, with the animal having been awake between scans. The radioactivity was allowed to clear fully between injections of the different radiotracers. Panel A also depicts MIPs of an [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) scan ( middle row, right . Same animal). The location of the tumor is indicated in the diagram ( lower right ). B , Effect of prior administration of [19F]FBA-PEG28-A20FMDV2.

Figures Figure 1 Use of ELISA to measure the effect of introducing PEG groups with and without [19F]FBA on the ability of A20FMDV2 to inhibit binding of biotinylated (Bt) natural ligands to immobilized integrins. Peptides and biotinylated ligands were mixed and allowed to compete during one hour for binding to integrin ?v?6 ( A ); ?v?3, ?v?5, ?5?1, or ?IIb?3 ( B ). Ligands used were Bt-fibronectin (?v?6, ?5?1), Bt-vitronectin (?v?3, ?v?5), or Bt-fibrinogen (?IIb?3). Plots represent triplicate experiments at each concentration. Points , % inhibition; bars , SD. IC50 values were derived from graph A . Figure 2 Expression of integrin ?v?6 by cell lines used in this study. Flow cytometry histogram plots for an ?v?6-positive (DX3puro?6) and an ?v?6-negative (DX3puro) cell line ( A ) and seven pancreatic cancer cell lines ( B ) were obtained. Levels of ?v?6 ( gray histograms ) were determined using the integrin ?v?6-specific antibody 10D5. Mouse IgG (MOPC 21; white histogram ) was used as antibody control.
