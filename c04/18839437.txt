A novel report of cIg-FISH and cytogenetics in POEMS syndrome POEMS syndrome is a plasma cell proliferative disorder whose pathogenesis is poorly understood. We provide the first report of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin/FISH testing (cIg-FISH) in POEMS syndrome using established myeloma markers. We reviewed all 37 POEMS cases seen at our institution in which cIg-FISH testing had been obtained. Monosomy 13 was seen in 14 of the 37 (38%) cIg-FISH samples. One patient had trisomy 3 and 7. Three patients had IgH translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32). No abnormalities were seen at 17p13(p53). The monosomy 13 is in line with other plasma cell disorders while the low prevalence of hyperdiploidy and abnormalities at 14q32 is unique.  Introduction POEMS syndrome, or osteosclerotic myeloma, is an uncommon plasma cell disorder associated with peripheral neuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin changes, as well as sclerotic bone lesions, Castleman disease, thrombocytosis, and edema [ 1 ]. The predominant symptom is the peripheral neuropathy, and the vast majority of patients will have at least one identifiable bone lesion. That the median survival is 13.8 years [ 2 ] and renal manifestations are rare clearly distinguishes POEMS from multiple myeloma (MM). Most patients also have fewer than 5% plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy. Cytogenetics and FISH analyses are now firmly established as important prognostic markers in MM [ 3 ]. Of particular significance are IgH gene locus translocations including t(4;14) and t(14;16), and loss of the p53 gene locus at 17p13, as all these carry negative prognostic significance. Deletion of chromosome 13 (del13/-13q), when found by FISH, has a neutral prognostic impact although it is most commonly seen along with the more unfavorable IgH translocations and deletion 17p13. In contrast, t(11;14) appears to carry a favorable or neutral prognostic significance. These same abnormalities have been identified in MGUS patients, with conflicting data about their prognostic significance for evolution of MGUS to MM [ 4 – 6 ]. This study was designed to investigate whether the cIg-FISH abnormalities typical for MM and MGUS are also present in POEMS syndrome.  Results and Discussion The clinical characteristics of the patients studied are shown in Table I . The patient characteristics are consistent with published data for POEMS syndrome [ 1 ]. At the time of testing, 11 patients had prior chemotherapy. All patients had a monoclonal plasma cell dyscrasia documented by either clonal bone marrow plasmacytosis, a clonal plasmacytoma, or a monoclonal protein in the serum or urine. Twenty-seven patients had a monoclonal protein detected in their serum, 19 IgA and 8 IgG. Twenty-six had clonal plasma cells on bone iliac crest biopsy, whereas 11 had a normal bone marrow. As with MM and MGUS, clonal plasma cells in POEMS syndrome have a relatively low proliferative rate, which, when combined with the low overall tumor burden in POEMS syndrome can challenge the sensitivity of available techniques for detecting cytogenetic abnormalities. Thirty-seven total karyotypes analyses were attempted of which two showed an insufficient number of suitable metaphases. Of the 37 karyotype analyses, 32 were normal, two displayed characteristic plasma cell anomalies (hyperdiploid with structural anomalies), two previously treated patients displayed del20q anomalies, and one patient had a constitutional 13;14 translocation. One patient developed a t(9;22) positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) three years into his POEMS syndrome disease course after having undergone autologous stem cell transplant for the POEMS. Retrospective analysis on POEMS syndrome pre-transplant bone marrow for the t(9;22) translocation revealed that 1% of cells harbored the t(9;22) translocation. cIg FISH was attempted in 37 patients but 6 had insufficient plasma cells. Twelve patients had normal cIg-FISH (39%). ?13/del13q was seen in 14 of the 31 (45%) patients. Two patients with ?13/del13q also had monosomy of IgH, and one of these patients also had monosomy of c-maf on chromosome 16. Five patients had IgH translocation, three with t(11;14)(q13;q32) and two with an undefined partner. None had deletion 17p13 (p53) (see Fig. 1 ). A striking finding in our study is the low rate of detection of cytogenetics abnormalities in patients with POEMS, 10% with abnormal metaphase cytogenetics and 48% with cIg- FISH abnormalities. The respective rates in patients with myeloma are 30–50 and 90%, respectively [ 4 , 6 ]. Only one prior study has been published, which reported on FISH testing in POEMS syndrome. That study looked for hyperdiploidy in bone marrow plasma cells using centromeric probes for chromosomes 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11 [ 7 ]. Of their four patients, one had trisomy 9 and one had trisomy 11. We are the first to report the results of cIg-FISH analyses in POEMS syndrome using the probes that are now considered standard for patients with myeloma. The prevalence of del13 is similar to the 33–54% reported in MM studies [ 6 , 8 , 9 ] and the ~30% reported in patients with AL amyloidosis [ 10 ] and [Bryce, et al., unpublished observations]. Although our rate of t(11;14) at 8% is lower than the 15–20% seen in MM [ 6 ] and than the 39–55% rate seen in AL amyloidosis [ 10 , 11 ] and [Bryce, et al., unpublished observations], the relatively small sample size prevents any conclusions from being drawn. The lack of abnormality at 17p13 is perhaps expected to be given the long survival in POEMS, as this is generally a late event with shorter survival in MM, where it occurs in about 10% [13]. In summary, in patients with POEMS ?13/del13q is common, translocations of the IgH locus appear to be less prevalent, and FISH abnormalities associated with poor prognosis in myeloma are rare, all of which are unique observations. While the similarities among the various plasma cell disorders speak to their relationship, the differences may serve as important clues to the underpinnings not only of POEMS, but also of these other more common plasma cell disorders.  Materials and Methods Patients Using the institutional dysproteinemia database, we reviewed all cases of POEMS seen at our institution. We identified 37 patients with metaphase cytogenetics and 10 with cIg-FISH testing, results between September 2000 and July 2007. The remaining 27 patients had FISH performed outside of clinical care on cytospin slides that had been banked for research purposes. All patients had signed institutional consent to allow their clinical data to be reviewed, and those who had their cIg FISH done as a research test had provided written consent for research samples to be obtained. This study was approved by the institutional review board. Interphase cytogenetic analysis The cIg-FISH test uses commercially available and in-house chromosome- specific fluorescent-labeled DNA probes for FISH. Bone marrow samples were processed to keep the cytoplasm of the leukocytes intact. Slides were prepared using a cytospin centrifuge. Each probe set was hybridized to a separate hybridization site. Plasma cells were specifically detected by using immunoglobulin staining techniques with commercially available antibodies (cIg) for kappa and lambda. Deletions or monosomies of chromosomes 13 and 17 were detected using FISH enumeration strategies using 13q14 (RB1) and 13q34 (LAMP1) and 17p13.1 (p53). Centromere probes were used to detect chromosomal aneusomies for chromosomes 3, 7, 9, 15, and 17 using probes D3Z1, D7Z1, D9Z1, D15Z4, and D17Z1, respectively. Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH) were investigated using probes for 14q32 (IGH-XT) and 14q32 (5?IGH,3?IGH). Partner translocations for chromosomes 4p16.3 ( FGFR3 ), 11 ( CCND1 ), or 16q23 (c-MAF) were detected by double fusion (D-FISH) strategies.
