Variants in the melatonin receptor 1B gene ( MTNR1B ) influence fasting glucose levels To identify novel genetic loci associated with fasting glucose concentrations, we examined the leading association signals in 10 genome-wide association scans involving a total of 36,610 individuals of European descent. Variants in the gene encoding the melatonin receptor 1B ( MTNR1B ) were consistently associated with fasting glucose across all ten studies. The strongest signal was observed at rs10830963, where each G-allele (frequency 0.30 in HapMap CEU) was associated with an increase of 0.07 (95%CI 0.06–0.08) mmol/L in fasting glucose levels ( P =3.2×10?50) and reduced beta-cell function as measured by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-B, P =1.1×10?15). The same allele was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio = 1.09 (1.05–1.12), per G allele P =3.3×10?7) in a meta-analysis of thirteen case-control studies totalling 18,236 cases and 64,453 controls. Our analyses also confirm previous associations of fasting glucose with variants at the G6PC2 (rs560887, P =1.1×10?57) and GCK (rs4607517, P =1.0×10?25) loci.
