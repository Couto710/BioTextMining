Cardiac Sodium Channel Variants: Action Players with Many Faces  Conclusions Recent studies have provided evidence of a genetic contribution to AF. Mutations in genes that encode for cardiac ion channels have been associated with familial AF. In addition, a number of loci that confer increased vulnerability to AF have been described. The prevailing conceptual model proposed for AF pathogenesis describes reduced atrial refractory period as a substrate for re-entrant arrhythmias. This is supported by reports of gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding subunits of cardiac potassium channels responsible for generating I Ks ( KCNQ1 / KCNE2 ) and I K1 ( KCNJ2 ) and these are predicted to decrease action potential duration. Such understanding provides a therapeutic rationale for prolonging the atrial refractory period. In contrast, Benito et al describe a SCN5A gain-of-function mutation in family with a mixed phenotype of LQTS3 and familial lone AF. As this mutation translates into action potential prolongation, a sodium channel blocker would be an appropriate mechanism-based therapy for AF in this family. Although a unifying effect of the AF-associated potassium and sodium channel variants on membrane conductance is unlikely, an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of AF is a critical step in a path to targeted rather than empiric therapy for this common and morbid condition.
