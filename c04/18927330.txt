Nuclear Imaging and Minimally Invasive Surgery in the Management of Hyperparathyroidism * Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia, and the treatment is primarily surgical. Because of biochemical screening, more patients now present with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism, and consensus guidelines have been developed for the treatment of these patients. There is now considerable interest in minimally invasive approaches to the treatment of hyperparathyroidism. Sestamibi scanning as a localizing study, used in combination with anatomic imaging and intraoperative rapid parathyroid hormone assays, has enabled focused surgical approaches. Patients with localizing studies that indicate a single parathyroid adenoma are candidates for such approaches, including unilateral neck exploration, minimally invasive single-gland exploration, or endoscopic exploration instead of the traditional approach of bilateral neck exploration. Nuclear imaging is also critical to the successful management of patients with persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism.  CONCLUSION The treatment of parathyroid disease is primarily surgical, but successful treatment must occur in the context of a team, including a radiologist skilled at performing sestamibi scanning and anatomic radiologists able to perform ultrasonography and other imaging modalities. The ability to perform rapid intraoperative PTH testing is also important. Endocrinologists are the experts in evaluating and diagnosing primary hyperparathyroidism. An experienced surgeon is also a critical member of the team.
