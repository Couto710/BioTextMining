Epigenetic Regulation of Foxp3 Expression in Regulatory T Cells by DNA Methylation 1 Foxp3, a winged-helix family transcription factor, serves as the master switch for CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg). We identified a unique and evolutionarily conserved CpG-rich island of the Foxp3 nonintronic upstream enhancer and discovered that a specific site within it was unmethylated in natural Treg (nTreg) but heavily methylated in naive CD4+ T cells, activated CD4+ T cells, and peripheral TGF?-induced Treg in which it was bound by DNMT1, DNMT3b, MeCP2, and MBD2. Demethylation of this CpG site using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2?-deoxycytidine (Aza) induced acetylation of histone 3, interaction with TIEG1 and Sp1, and resulted in strong and stable induction of Foxp3. Conversely, IL-6 resulted in methylation of this site and repression of Foxp3 expression. Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg resembled nTreg, expressing similar receptors, cytokines, and stable suppressive activity. Strong Foxp3 expression and suppressor activity could be induced in a variety of T cells, including human CD4+CD25? T cells. Epigenetic regulation of Foxp3 can be predictably controlled with DNMT inhibitors to generate functional, stable, and specific Treg.

Results Methylation of upstream Foxp3 enhancer Analysis of ~30 kb of mouse genomic DNA containing the Foxp3 gene (GenBank accession no. AF277994) demonstrated that upstream to the transcriptional start site is a CpG island at -4970 to -6021 with 66.95% GC and an observed:expected GC ratio of 0.92 ( Fig. 1 A ), and this sequence is highly conserved in humans (92% identity) ( supplemental Fig. S1 ). Its methylation status was determined by methyl-specific restriction digestion. Because Foxp3 is on the X-chromosome, male mice cells were used to avoid artifacts from X-chromosome inactivation in females. To ensure highly purified cells, Foxp3gfp mice were used ( 5 ). The site from residues -5786 to -5558 containing 23 CpG was methylated in naive CD4+CD25?gfp? T cells but demethylated in CD4+ CD25+Foxp3+gfp+ nTreg ( Fig. 1 B ). In TGF? induced CD4+ CD25+Foxp3+gfp+ Treg this site was also methylated ( Fig. 1 B ), demonstrating significant differences in the genomic structure of the two Treg subsets. The H19 gene used as a control is demethylated and expressed during gametogenesis and is methylated in differentiated T cells ( 28 ). H19 was methylated in all T cell subsets tested ( Fig. 1 B ) so that DNA demethylation was upstream Foxp3 enhancer specific. Disulphite sequencing also showed that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer was heavily methylated (~90%) in naive CD4+ T cells but completely demethylated in nTreg ( Fig. 1 C ). A different nearby site from -5252 to -5030 containing 12 CpG was demethylated in all T cell subsets ( Fig. 1 C ). The H19 control region was methylated in both naive and nTregs ( Fig. 1 C ). Together, these results demonstrated a specific upstream Foxp3 CpG site in the Foxp3 enhancer that was similarly methylated in naive CD4+ T cells and TGF?-induced peripheral Treg, but demethylated in nTreg. Demethylation of upstream Foxp3 enhancer induces Foxp3 expression Because there was differential methylation of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer in T cell subsets, we determined whether the site could be demethylated and Foxp3 expression induced with the DNMT inhibitor Aza, an anticancer drug known as decitabine, that can induce the expression of methylated genes ( 29 ). Aza induced Foxp3 protein and mRNA expression in naive CD4+CD25? T cells ( Fig. 2 A ) in a dose- ( supplemental Fig. S2 A ) and time-dependent fashion ( supplemental Fig. S2, B and C ). The addition of anti-TGF? mAb to culture did not inhibit Aza-induced Foxp3 expression, showing that serum TGF? was not required for Aza to inhibit DNMTs (not shown). Further, whereas TGF? induces Foxp3 expression in peripheral naive CD4+CD25? T cells ( 9 , 10 ), the results in Fig. 1 B showed that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer remained methylated in TGF?-induced Treg. Because TGF? does induce Foxp3, the combination of Aza plus TGF? was tested for Foxp3 induction. The results showed that Aza plus TGF? efficiently induced Foxp3 in 72% of T cells compared with 44% with TGF? alone, 35% with Aza alone, and 91% in control nTreg ( Fig. 2 B ). This effect was synergistic, so that expression was induced by even very low concentrations of Aza plus TGF? ( Fig. 2 C ) compared with Aza alone ( supplemental Fig. S2 A ). The other mechanistically and structurally diverse DNMT inhibitors RG108, hydralazine, and procainamide also induced Foxp3 expression in combination with TGF? ( Fig. 2 D ). Importantly, in our culture conditions Aza or Aza plus TGF? lead to complete demethylation of the Foxp3 CpG site, whereas the H19 promoter and AID first intronic region remained methylated ( Fig. 2, E and F ). The AID intronic region has been shown to be hypomethylated in germinal center B cells but hypermethylated and not expressed in T cells ( 30 ). Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg expressed similar levels of cytokine mRNA except for slightly increased IL-4 and IL-17 mRNA and a greater increase in IL-10 mRNA compared with nTreg ( supplemental Fig. S2 D ), and expressed similar surface markers, except for slight decreases in CD28, CD62L, and CD122 (IL-2R?) ( supplemental Fig. S2 E ). Thus, Aza induced demethylation of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer to allow enhanced Foxp3 expression and subsequent downstream effects of induction of Foxp3-dependent, Treg-restricted sets of genesrather than indiscriminately activating many loci. Together, these results showed that Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg were similar to conventional nTreg. Upstream Foxp3 enhancer is occupied by DNMTs and transcriptional repressors DNA methylation is performed by three known DNMTs: DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b. ChIP assays for DNMTs showed that nTreg had >8-fold difference in DNMT1 and >12-fold difference in DNMT3b binding to the upstream Foxp3 enhancer CpG island compared with naive CD4+ T cells ( Fig. 3 A ), whereas there was no significant difference in DNMT3a binding ( supplemental Fig. S3 ). The results for Aza plus TGF? Treg were similar to those of nTreg. Importantly, TGF?-induced Treg had much greater binding of DNMT1 and DNMT3b compared with nTreg or Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg ( Fig. 3 A ). This suggested that DNMT1 and DNMT3b were recruited to the upstream Foxp3 enhancer to maintain CpG methylation in naive CD4+ T cells and TGF?-induced Treg. There was similar differential binding of the transcriptional repressors MBD2 and MeCP2 to this same site in naive CD4+CD25? T cells, activated T cells, and TGF?-induced Treg compared with Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg or nTreg ( Fig. 3, B and C ). To further assess the upstream Foxp3 enhancer activity, the sequence was cloned into a vector with an SV40 minimal promoter and luciferase reporter activity was measured after transfection into the BW5147.3 T cell lymphoma line. This upstream Foxp3 enhancer induced ~30-fold reporter activity compared with the control vector ( Fig. 3 D ). Cotransfection of DNMT1, DNMT3a, or DNMT3b1 inhibited enhancer activity, suggesting that methylation repressed transcriptional activity ( Fig. 3 E ). To demonstrate that inhibition of enhancer activity was due to methylation of the enhancer and not the vector backbone, the upstream Foxp3 enhancer was first methylated in vitro, ligated into the pGL3 promoter vector, and then enhancer activity was monitored after transfection into the BW5147.3 cell line. The results show that in vitro methylation inhibits upstream Foxp3 enhancer activity ( Fig. 3 F ). Sp1 and TIEG1 binding and histone 3 acetylation in Treg subsets Actively transcribed genes have demethylated CpG islands, and the GC box is occupied by the transcription factor Sp1 ( 31 , 32 ). To determine the binding of Sp1 to this enhancer, ChIP analyses were performed. In nTreg and Aza plus TGF? Treg this CpG site was occupied by Sp1, but not in naive CD4+CD25? T cells, activated CD4+ T cells, or TGF?-induced Treg ( Fig. 4 A ). The specificity of binding of Sp1 to the sequence was confirmed by EMSA ( Fig. 4 B ). This suggests that Sp1 binds the upstream Foxp3 enhancer and is involved in the function of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer. Histone acetylation is an additional feature of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation ( 24 , 33 ). ChIP assays for acetylated histone 3 (AcH3) showed that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer was acetylated in nTreg (>4.5-fold) and Aza plus TGF? induced Treg (~3-fold), but not in activated CD4+ T cells (~1.5-fold) or TGF?-induced Treg (~1.1-fold) ( Fig. 4 C ). Analysis predicted that upstream Foxp3 enhancer possesses numerous TIEG1, EGR1, and AP-2a binding sites. TIEG1 and EGR1 are homologous and transcribed from differentially regulated, alternative promoters but use common exons in most all of their coding regions ( 34 ). Recently it has been shown that TIEG1 plays role in the Foxp3 expression and Treg function ( 35 ). ChIP analysis for TIEG1 showed significant binding to the upstream Foxp3 enhancer in Aza plus TGF? induced Treg and nTreg compared with naive CD4+CD25? T cells, activated T cells, or TGF?-induced Treg ( Fig. 4 D ). In contrast, AP-2a and EGR1 were not differentially bound in these subsets ( supplemental Fig. S3, B and C ). To show that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer is unique in its regulation, we also analyzed the Foxp3 proximal promoter located at the transcriptional start site ( 36 ). There was no significant difference in histone acetylation at this site between TGF? or Aza plus TGF? Treg ( Fig. 4 C ), whereas nTreg had increased acetylation at this site (10-fold). Likewise, by ChIP assay there was no significant difference in pSmad2/3 binding between TGF?-induced or Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg at the Smad consensus site ( Fig. 4 E ), although nTreg had increased binding (~8-fold). The role of TGF? signaling was confirmed in Smad3?/? cells, where TGF?-induced but not Aza-induced Foxp3 expression was inhibited compared with Smad3+/+ controls ( Fig. 4 F ). Importantly, the generation of thymic-derived nTreg is not affected in TGF?1?/? or Smad3?/? mice ( 37 ). Thus, the Foxp3 proximal promoter structure and responsiveness to TGF? differs between nTreg and other Treg subsets, whereas the upstream Foxp3 enhancer is similar only between nTreg and Aza-induced Treg, suggesting that the upstream enhancer activity is specifically involved in nTreg but not in TGF?-induced peripheral Treg generation and function. IL-6 decreases Foxp3 expression and increases upstream Foxp3 enhancer CpG methylation in nTreg IL-6 regulates the reciprocal development of Treg and Th17 ( 38 ) and inhibits Foxp3 expression and suppressive function in nTreg ( 39 , 40 ). To determine whether the IL-6-induced loss of Foxp3 is due to changes in the upstream Foxp3 enhancer structure and transcription, highly purified CD4+CD25+ T cells were purified using flow cytometry ( Fig. 5 A ). Purified nTreg were cultured with or without IL-6 and results showed that IL-6 inhibited both Foxp3 protein ( Fig. 5 A ) and mRNA expression in nTreg ( Fig. 5 B ). To confirm that the increase in Foxp3?CD4+ T cells was not due to overgrowth of Foxp3? T cells present at the initiation of culture, CD4+Foxp3gfp+ nTreg (90%) (CD45.2) were stimulated along with congenically marked naive CD4+CD25?CD45.1+ cells (10%) in the presence or absence of IL-6 for 4 days. IL-6 down-regulated Foxp3gfp in CD4+CD45.1? nTreg ( supplemental Fig. S4 ), whereas the total percentage of CD4+CD45.1+ cells did not change significantly (IL-2, anti-CD3?: 11.5%; IL-2, anti-CD3?, TGF?: 12.9%; IL-2, anti-CD3?, TGF?, IL-6: 8.61%), showing that the IL-6-induced increase in Foxp3? cells is not due to over-growth of CD4+Foxp3? T cells. ChIP analysis showed IL-6-induced deacetylation of histone 3 at the upstream Foxp3 enhancer ( Fig. 5 C ). To examine IL-6-induced inhibition in Foxp3 expression, Foxp3gfp+ nTreg were purified from Foxp3gfp reporter mice. These purified CD4+Foxp3gfp+ nTreg cultured with IL-6 and TGF?, and ~20% of the cells down-regulated Foxp3gfp expression. Analyses of purified subsets showed increased DNMT1 binding ( Fig. 5 D ) and methylation of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer ( Fig. 5, E and F ) and repression of Foxp3 transcription ( Fig. 5 G ) in Foxp3gfp? cells compared with Foxp3gfp+ CD4 T cells. In the same cultures we did not observe IL-17 mRNA expression in the Foxp3gfp? or Foxp3gfp+ T cells (data not shown). Importantly, IL-6 did not inhibit Foxp3 expression in STAT3-deficient nTreg ( Fig. 5 H ), showing that IL-6-induced CpG methylation and inhibition of Foxp3 expression are STAT3 dependent. Characterization of Foxp3 induction and maintenance by Aza Because DNMT inhibition by Aza is most effective in actively proliferating cells ( 41 , 42 ), the timing of Aza exposure was examined. The results showed that 24 h of exposure starting at culture initiation, but not later times, was required to induce maximal Foxp3 expression ( Fig. 6 A , and data not shown). Thus, DNMT inhibition was required early and briefly during the initial proliferative cycle. Monitoring expression with respect to proliferation (CFSE dilution) showed that Foxp3 was expressed early after the initial division in TGF? Treg and Aza plus TGF? Treg, and Foxp3 did not increase or accumulate with more division cycles ( Fig. 6 B ). A gene dosage effect was not observed in male compared with female cells (data not shown). Apoptosis, proliferation, and cell accumulation were not significantly different in ZyCyd plus TGF?-induced Treg compared with TGF?-induced Treg ( supplemental Fig. S5 A ). To measure the stability of expression, Tregwere generated, purified, and recultured. The Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg maintained a much higher percentage of Foxp3+ cells compared with TGF?-induced Treg ( Fig. 6 C ). Activated T cells that have undergone other differentiation pathways do not usually differentiate toward the Foxp3+ Treg fate ( 43 ). Because Aza might reprogram cells by altering gene methylation, we determined whether previously activated cells could be induced to express Foxp3. CD4+CD25? T cells were stimulated, rested, and then restimulated with Aza. Preactivated T cells could not be induced to express Foxp3 ( supplemental Fig. S5 B ), although they were very sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of Aza treatment (data not shown). Other time intervals for primary stimulation followed by re-stimulation with Aza did not induce Foxp3 expression (data not shown). Further analysis showed that Aza could not induce strong Foxp3 expression in CD4+CD44highCD62Llow (memory) T cells in combination with TGF? but did so in CD4+CD44lowCD62Lhigh (naive) T cells ( Fig. 6 D ), suggesting that apart from CpG demethylation, there were other dominant pathways and factors that played essential roles in Foxp3 expression. To determine whether other signals influenced Aza and TGF?-driven Treg differentiation or whether Aza influenced T cell differentiation to other lineages, cultures were established that incorporated Aza and other Th conditions. The results showed that IL-6 along with TGF? (Th17 conditions) inhibited Foxp3 expression, whereas Th1 and Th2 cytokines had only minor effects on Foxp3 expression in combination with TGF? and Aza ( Fig. 6 E ). Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines were measured in their cognate culture conditions. Aza increased the expression of IFN-? in Th1 and IL-4 in Th2 cultures, but not IL-17 in Th17 cultures ( Fig. 6 F ). Together, the results suggested that DNMT inhibition is most effective at driving T cells into the Treg lineage ( Fig. 6 E ), but that this strategy may be used to drive some but not all other lineages. Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg are suppressive Because Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg resembled conventional nTreg ( supplemental Fig. S2, D and E ), their functional activities were evaluated. Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg inhibited proliferation of CD4+CD25? T cells ( Fig. 7 A ) and were similar in potency to nTreg. Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg inhibited CD4+CD25? CD45RBhigh T cell-induced colitis and splenomegaly in CB17. SCID ( Fig. 7, B and C ), and recipients sustained ~2-fold more splenic Foxp3+ T cells over time compared with mice that received TGF?-induced Treg ( supplemental Fig. S6 ). Adoptive transfer of Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg also prolonged pancreatic islet allograft survival ( Fig. 7 D ). Together, the results demonstrated potent and stable suppressor function. Aza plus TGF? induce suppressive Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> human T cells CD4+CD25? T cells were isolated from human PBMC and cultured in the presence of IL-2, anti-CD3? mAb, TGF?, and Aza for 6 days. Aza plus TGF? induced a higher percentage of Foxp3+ cells (67%) ( Fig. 8 A ), a greater number of Foxp3 bright cells (48.8%), and enhanced Foxp3 gene expression compared with TGF? alone (36.4%) ( Fig. 8 B ). Foxp3 is an activation marker but not an exclusive Treg marker in man, so human TGF?-induced Treg are not necessarily anergic or suppressive ( 44 ). To determine whether Aza also induced regulatory function, a suppression assay was performed. Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg were almost as suppressive as CD4+CD25+ nTreg, whereas TGF?-induced Treg had less suppressive potency, particularly at higher cell ratios ( Fig. 8 C ). This suggested that low Foxp3 expression in IL-2 plus anti-CD3? mAb or IL-2 plus anti-CD3? mAb plus TGF?-stimulated human T cells were not sufficient for conversion to functional suppressive Treg activity ( Fig. 8, A and B ).  Results Methylation of upstream Foxp3 enhancer Analysis of ~30 kb of mouse genomic DNA containing the Foxp3 gene (GenBank accession no. AF277994) demonstrated that upstream to the transcriptional start site is a CpG island at -4970 to -6021 with 66.95% GC and an observed:expected GC ratio of 0.92 ( Fig. 1 A ), and this sequence is highly conserved in humans (92% identity) ( supplemental Fig. S1 ). Its methylation status was determined by methyl-specific restriction digestion. Because Foxp3 is on the X-chromosome, male mice cells were used to avoid artifacts from X-chromosome inactivation in females. To ensure highly purified cells, Foxp3gfp mice were used ( 5 ). The site from residues -5786 to -5558 containing 23 CpG was methylated in naive CD4+CD25?gfp? T cells but demethylated in CD4+ CD25+Foxp3+gfp+ nTreg ( Fig. 1 B ). In TGF? induced CD4+ CD25+Foxp3+gfp+ Treg this site was also methylated ( Fig. 1 B ), demonstrating significant differences in the genomic structure of the two Treg subsets. The H19 gene used as a control is demethylated and expressed during gametogenesis and is methylated in differentiated T cells ( 28 ). H19 was methylated in all T cell subsets tested ( Fig. 1 B ) so that DNA demethylation was upstream Foxp3 enhancer specific. Disulphite sequencing also showed that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer was heavily methylated (~90%) in naive CD4+ T cells but completely demethylated in nTreg ( Fig. 1 C ). A different nearby site from -5252 to -5030 containing 12 CpG was demethylated in all T cell subsets ( Fig. 1 C ). The H19 control region was methylated in both naive and nTregs ( Fig. 1 C ). Together, these results demonstrated a specific upstream Foxp3 CpG site in the Foxp3 enhancer that was similarly methylated in naive CD4+ T cells and TGF?-induced peripheral Treg, but demethylated in nTreg. Demethylation of upstream Foxp3 enhancer induces Foxp3 expression Because there was differential methylation of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer in T cell subsets, we determined whether the site could be demethylated and Foxp3 expression induced with the DNMT inhibitor Aza, an anticancer drug known as decitabine, that can induce the expression of methylated genes ( 29 ). Aza induced Foxp3 protein and mRNA expression in naive CD4+CD25? T cells ( Fig. 2 A ) in a dose- ( supplemental Fig. S2 A ) and time-dependent fashion ( supplemental Fig. S2, B and C ). The addition of anti-TGF? mAb to culture did not inhibit Aza-induced Foxp3 expression, showing that serum TGF? was not required for Aza to inhibit DNMTs (not shown). Further, whereas TGF? induces Foxp3 expression in peripheral naive CD4+CD25? T cells ( 9 , 10 ), the results in Fig. 1 B showed that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer remained methylated in TGF?-induced Treg. Because TGF? does induce Foxp3, the combination of Aza plus TGF? was tested for Foxp3 induction. The results showed that Aza plus TGF? efficiently induced Foxp3 in 72% of T cells compared with 44% with TGF? alone, 35% with Aza alone, and 91% in control nTreg ( Fig. 2 B ). This effect was synergistic, so that expression was induced by even very low concentrations of Aza plus TGF? ( Fig. 2 C ) compared with Aza alone ( supplemental Fig. S2 A ). The other mechanistically and structurally diverse DNMT inhibitors RG108, hydralazine, and procainamide also induced Foxp3 expression in combination with TGF? ( Fig. 2 D ). Importantly, in our culture conditions Aza or Aza plus TGF? lead to complete demethylation of the Foxp3 CpG site, whereas the H19 promoter and AID first intronic region remained methylated ( Fig. 2, E and F ). The AID intronic region has been shown to be hypomethylated in germinal center B cells but hypermethylated and not expressed in T cells ( 30 ). Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg expressed similar levels of cytokine mRNA except for slightly increased IL-4 and IL-17 mRNA and a greater increase in IL-10 mRNA compared with nTreg ( supplemental Fig. S2 D ), and expressed similar surface markers, except for slight decreases in CD28, CD62L, and CD122 (IL-2R?) ( supplemental Fig. S2 E ). Thus, Aza induced demethylation of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer to allow enhanced Foxp3 expression and subsequent downstream effects of induction of Foxp3-dependent, Treg-restricted sets of genesrather than indiscriminately activating many loci. Together, these results showed that Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg were similar to conventional nTreg. Upstream Foxp3 enhancer is occupied by DNMTs and transcriptional repressors DNA methylation is performed by three known DNMTs: DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b. ChIP assays for DNMTs showed that nTreg had >8-fold difference in DNMT1 and >12-fold difference in DNMT3b binding to the upstream Foxp3 enhancer CpG island compared with naive CD4+ T cells ( Fig. 3 A ), whereas there was no significant difference in DNMT3a binding ( supplemental Fig. S3 ). The results for Aza plus TGF? Treg were similar to those of nTreg. Importantly, TGF?-induced Treg had much greater binding of DNMT1 and DNMT3b compared with nTreg or Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg ( Fig. 3 A ). This suggested that DNMT1 and DNMT3b were recruited to the upstream Foxp3 enhancer to maintain CpG methylation in naive CD4+ T cells and TGF?-induced Treg. There was similar differential binding of the transcriptional repressors MBD2 and MeCP2 to this same site in naive CD4+CD25? T cells, activated T cells, and TGF?-induced Treg compared with Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg or nTreg ( Fig. 3, B and C ). To further assess the upstream Foxp3 enhancer activity, the sequence was cloned into a vector with an SV40 minimal promoter and luciferase reporter activity was measured after transfection into the BW5147.3 T cell lymphoma line. This upstream Foxp3 enhancer induced ~30-fold reporter activity compared with the control vector ( Fig. 3 D ). Cotransfection of DNMT1, DNMT3a, or DNMT3b1 inhibited enhancer activity, suggesting that methylation repressed transcriptional activity ( Fig. 3 E ). To demonstrate that inhibition of enhancer activity was due to methylation of the enhancer and not the vector backbone, the upstream Foxp3 enhancer was first methylated in vitro, ligated into the pGL3 promoter vector, and then enhancer activity was monitored after transfection into the BW5147.3 cell line. The results show that in vitro methylation inhibits upstream Foxp3 enhancer activity ( Fig. 3 F ). Sp1 and TIEG1 binding and histone 3 acetylation in Treg subsets Actively transcribed genes have demethylated CpG islands, and the GC box is occupied by the transcription factor Sp1 ( 31 , 32 ). To determine the binding of Sp1 to this enhancer, ChIP analyses were performed. In nTreg and Aza plus TGF? Treg this CpG site was occupied by Sp1, but not in naive CD4+CD25? T cells, activated CD4+ T cells, or TGF?-induced Treg ( Fig. 4 A ). The specificity of binding of Sp1 to the sequence was confirmed by EMSA ( Fig. 4 B ). This suggests that Sp1 binds the upstream Foxp3 enhancer and is involved in the function of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer. Histone acetylation is an additional feature of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation ( 24 , 33 ). ChIP assays for acetylated histone 3 (AcH3) showed that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer was acetylated in nTreg (>4.5-fold) and Aza plus TGF? induced Treg (~3-fold), but not in activated CD4+ T cells (~1.5-fold) or TGF?-induced Treg (~1.1-fold) ( Fig. 4 C ). Analysis predicted that upstream Foxp3 enhancer possesses numerous TIEG1, EGR1, and AP-2a binding sites. TIEG1 and EGR1 are homologous and transcribed from differentially regulated, alternative promoters but use common exons in most all of their coding regions ( 34 ). Recently it has been shown that TIEG1 plays role in the Foxp3 expression and Treg function ( 35 ). ChIP analysis for TIEG1 showed significant binding to the upstream Foxp3 enhancer in Aza plus TGF? induced Treg and nTreg compared with naive CD4+CD25? T cells, activated T cells, or TGF?-induced Treg ( Fig. 4 D ). In contrast, AP-2a and EGR1 were not differentially bound in these subsets ( supplemental Fig. S3, B and C ). To show that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer is unique in its regulation, we also analyzed the Foxp3 proximal promoter located at the transcriptional start site ( 36 ). There was no significant difference in histone acetylation at this site between TGF? or Aza plus TGF? Treg ( Fig. 4 C ), whereas nTreg had increased acetylation at this site (10-fold). Likewise, by ChIP assay there was no significant difference in pSmad2/3 binding between TGF?-induced or Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg at the Smad consensus site ( Fig. 4 E ), although nTreg had increased binding (~8-fold). The role of TGF? signaling was confirmed in Smad3?/? cells, where TGF?-induced but not Aza-induced Foxp3 expression was inhibited compared with Smad3+/+ controls ( Fig. 4 F ). Importantly, the generation of thymic-derived nTreg is not affected in TGF?1?/? or Smad3?/? mice ( 37 ). Thus, the Foxp3 proximal promoter structure and responsiveness to TGF? differs between nTreg and other Treg subsets, whereas the upstream Foxp3 enhancer is similar only between nTreg and Aza-induced Treg, suggesting that the upstream enhancer activity is specifically involved in nTreg but not in TGF?-induced peripheral Treg generation and function. IL-6 decreases Foxp3 expression and increases upstream Foxp3 enhancer CpG methylation in nTreg IL-6 regulates the reciprocal development of Treg and Th17 ( 38 ) and inhibits Foxp3 expression and suppressive function in nTreg ( 39 , 40 ). To determine whether the IL-6-induced loss of Foxp3 is due to changes in the upstream Foxp3 enhancer structure and transcription, highly purified CD4+CD25+ T cells were purified using flow cytometry ( Fig. 5 A ). Purified nTreg were cultured with or without IL-6 and results showed that IL-6 inhibited both Foxp3 protein ( Fig. 5 A ) and mRNA expression in nTreg ( Fig. 5 B ). To confirm that the increase in Foxp3?CD4+ T cells was not due to overgrowth of Foxp3? T cells present at the initiation of culture, CD4+Foxp3gfp+ nTreg (90%) (CD45.2) were stimulated along with congenically marked naive CD4+CD25?CD45.1+ cells (10%) in the presence or absence of IL-6 for 4 days. IL-6 down-regulated Foxp3gfp in CD4+CD45.1? nTreg ( supplemental Fig. S4 ), whereas the total percentage of CD4+CD45.1+ cells did not change significantly (IL-2, anti-CD3?: 11.5%; IL-2, anti-CD3?, TGF?: 12.9%; IL-2, anti-CD3?, TGF?, IL-6: 8.61%), showing that the IL-6-induced increase in Foxp3? cells is not due to over-growth of CD4+Foxp3? T cells. ChIP analysis showed IL-6-induced deacetylation of histone 3 at the upstream Foxp3 enhancer ( Fig. 5 C ). To examine IL-6-induced inhibition in Foxp3 expression, Foxp3gfp+ nTreg were purified from Foxp3gfp reporter mice. These purified CD4+Foxp3gfp+ nTreg cultured with IL-6 and TGF?, and ~20% of the cells down-regulated Foxp3gfp expression. Analyses of purified subsets showed increased DNMT1 binding ( Fig. 5 D ) and methylation of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer ( Fig. 5, E and F ) and repression of Foxp3 transcription ( Fig. 5 G ) in Foxp3gfp? cells compared with Foxp3gfp+ CD4 T cells. In the same cultures we did not observe IL-17 mRNA expression in the Foxp3gfp? or Foxp3gfp+ T cells (data not shown). Importantly, IL-6 did not inhibit Foxp3 expression in STAT3-deficient nTreg ( Fig. 5 H ), showing that IL-6-induced CpG methylation and inhibition of Foxp3 expression are STAT3 dependent. Characterization of Foxp3 induction and maintenance by Aza Because DNMT inhibition by Aza is most effective in actively proliferating cells ( 41 , 42 ), the timing of Aza exposure was examined. The results showed that 24 h of exposure starting at culture initiation, but not later times, was required to induce maximal Foxp3 expression ( Fig. 6 A , and data not shown). Thus, DNMT inhibition was required early and briefly during the initial proliferative cycle. Monitoring expression with respect to proliferation (CFSE dilution) showed that Foxp3 was expressed early after the initial division in TGF? Treg and Aza plus TGF? Treg, and Foxp3 did not increase or accumulate with more division cycles ( Fig. 6 B ). A gene dosage effect was not observed in male compared with female cells (data not shown). Apoptosis, proliferation, and cell accumulation were not significantly different in ZyCyd plus TGF?-induced Treg compared with TGF?-induced Treg ( supplemental Fig. S5 A ). To measure the stability of expression, Tregwere generated, purified, and recultured. The Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg maintained a much higher percentage of Foxp3+ cells compared with TGF?-induced Treg ( Fig. 6 C ). Activated T cells that have undergone other differentiation pathways do not usually differentiate toward the Foxp3+ Treg fate ( 43 ). Because Aza might reprogram cells by altering gene methylation, we determined whether previously activated cells could be induced to express Foxp3. CD4+CD25? T cells were stimulated, rested, and then restimulated with Aza. Preactivated T cells could not be induced to express Foxp3 ( supplemental Fig. S5 B ), although they were very sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of Aza treatment (data not shown). Other time intervals for primary stimulation followed by re-stimulation with Aza did not induce Foxp3 expression (data not shown). Further analysis showed that Aza could not induce strong Foxp3 expression in CD4+CD44highCD62Llow (memory) T cells in combination with TGF? but did so in CD4+CD44lowCD62Lhigh (naive) T cells ( Fig. 6 D ), suggesting that apart from CpG demethylation, there were other dominant pathways and factors that played essential roles in Foxp3 expression. To determine whether other signals influenced Aza and TGF?-driven Treg differentiation or whether Aza influenced T cell differentiation to other lineages, cultures were established that incorporated Aza and other Th conditions. The results showed that IL-6 along with TGF? (Th17 conditions) inhibited Foxp3 expression, whereas Th1 and Th2 cytokines had only minor effects on Foxp3 expression in combination with TGF? and Aza ( Fig. 6 E ). Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines were measured in their cognate culture conditions. Aza increased the expression of IFN-? in Th1 and IL-4 in Th2 cultures, but not IL-17 in Th17 cultures ( Fig. 6 F ). Together, the results suggested that DNMT inhibition is most effective at driving T cells into the Treg lineage ( Fig. 6 E ), but that this strategy may be used to drive some but not all other lineages. Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg are suppressive Because Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg resembled conventional nTreg ( supplemental Fig. S2, D and E ), their functional activities were evaluated. Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg inhibited proliferation of CD4+CD25? T cells ( Fig. 7 A ) and were similar in potency to nTreg. Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg inhibited CD4+CD25? CD45RBhigh T cell-induced colitis and splenomegaly in CB17. SCID ( Fig. 7, B and C ), and recipients sustained ~2-fold more splenic Foxp3+ T cells over time compared with mice that received TGF?-induced Treg ( supplemental Fig. S6 ). Adoptive transfer of Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg also prolonged pancreatic islet allograft survival ( Fig. 7 D ). Together, the results demonstrated potent and stable suppressor function. Aza plus TGF? induce suppressive Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> human T cells CD4+CD25? T cells were isolated from human PBMC and cultured in the presence of IL-2, anti-CD3? mAb, TGF?, and Aza for 6 days. Aza plus TGF? induced a higher percentage of Foxp3+ cells (67%) ( Fig. 8 A ), a greater number of Foxp3 bright cells (48.8%), and enhanced Foxp3 gene expression compared with TGF? alone (36.4%) ( Fig. 8 B ). Foxp3 is an activation marker but not an exclusive Treg marker in man, so human TGF?-induced Treg are not necessarily anergic or suppressive ( 44 ). To determine whether Aza also induced regulatory function, a suppression assay was performed. Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg were almost as suppressive as CD4+CD25+ nTreg, whereas TGF?-induced Treg had less suppressive potency, particularly at higher cell ratios ( Fig. 8 C ). This suggested that low Foxp3 expression in IL-2 plus anti-CD3? mAb or IL-2 plus anti-CD3? mAb plus TGF?-stimulated human T cells were not sufficient for conversion to functional suppressive Treg activity ( Fig. 8, A and B ).  Methylation of upstream Foxp3 enhancer Analysis of ~30 kb of mouse genomic DNA containing the Foxp3 gene (GenBank accession no. AF277994) demonstrated that upstream to the transcriptional start site is a CpG island at -4970 to -6021 with 66.95% GC and an observed:expected GC ratio of 0.92 ( Fig. 1 A ), and this sequence is highly conserved in humans (92% identity) ( supplemental Fig. S1 ). Its methylation status was determined by methyl-specific restriction digestion. Because Foxp3 is on the X-chromosome, male mice cells were used to avoid artifacts from X-chromosome inactivation in females. To ensure highly purified cells, Foxp3gfp mice were used ( 5 ). The site from residues -5786 to -5558 containing 23 CpG was methylated in naive CD4+CD25?gfp? T cells but demethylated in CD4+ CD25+Foxp3+gfp+ nTreg ( Fig. 1 B ). In TGF? induced CD4+ CD25+Foxp3+gfp+ Treg this site was also methylated ( Fig. 1 B ), demonstrating significant differences in the genomic structure of the two Treg subsets. The H19 gene used as a control is demethylated and expressed during gametogenesis and is methylated in differentiated T cells ( 28 ). H19 was methylated in all T cell subsets tested ( Fig. 1 B ) so that DNA demethylation was upstream Foxp3 enhancer specific. Disulphite sequencing also showed that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer was heavily methylated (~90%) in naive CD4+ T cells but completely demethylated in nTreg ( Fig. 1 C ). A different nearby site from -5252 to -5030 containing 12 CpG was demethylated in all T cell subsets ( Fig. 1 C ). The H19 control region was methylated in both naive and nTregs ( Fig. 1 C ). Together, these results demonstrated a specific upstream Foxp3 CpG site in the Foxp3 enhancer that was similarly methylated in naive CD4+ T cells and TGF?-induced peripheral Treg, but demethylated in nTreg.  Methylation of upstream Foxp3 enhancer Analysis of ~30 kb of mouse genomic DNA containing the Foxp3 gene (GenBank accession no. AF277994) demonstrated that upstream to the transcriptional start site is a CpG island at -4970 to -6021 with 66.95% GC and an observed:expected GC ratio of 0.92 ( Fig. 1 A ), and this sequence is highly conserved in humans (92% identity) ( supplemental Fig. S1 ). Its methylation status was determined by methyl-specific restriction digestion. Because Foxp3 is on the X-chromosome, male mice cells were used to avoid artifacts from X-chromosome inactivation in females. To ensure highly purified cells, Foxp3gfp mice were used ( 5 ). The site from residues -5786 to -5558 containing 23 CpG was methylated in naive CD4+CD25?gfp? T cells but demethylated in CD4+ CD25+Foxp3+gfp+ nTreg ( Fig. 1 B ). In TGF? induced CD4+ CD25+Foxp3+gfp+ Treg this site was also methylated ( Fig. 1 B ), demonstrating significant differences in the genomic structure of the two Treg subsets. The H19 gene used as a control is demethylated and expressed during gametogenesis and is methylated in differentiated T cells ( 28 ). H19 was methylated in all T cell subsets tested ( Fig. 1 B ) so that DNA demethylation was upstream Foxp3 enhancer specific. Disulphite sequencing also showed that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer was heavily methylated (~90%) in naive CD4+ T cells but completely demethylated in nTreg ( Fig. 1 C ). A different nearby site from -5252 to -5030 containing 12 CpG was demethylated in all T cell subsets ( Fig. 1 C ). The H19 control region was methylated in both naive and nTregs ( Fig. 1 C ). Together, these results demonstrated a specific upstream Foxp3 CpG site in the Foxp3 enhancer that was similarly methylated in naive CD4+ T cells and TGF?-induced peripheral Treg, but demethylated in nTreg.  Demethylation of upstream Foxp3 enhancer induces Foxp3 expression Because there was differential methylation of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer in T cell subsets, we determined whether the site could be demethylated and Foxp3 expression induced with the DNMT inhibitor Aza, an anticancer drug known as decitabine, that can induce the expression of methylated genes ( 29 ). Aza induced Foxp3 protein and mRNA expression in naive CD4+CD25? T cells ( Fig. 2 A ) in a dose- ( supplemental Fig. S2 A ) and time-dependent fashion ( supplemental Fig. S2, B and C ). The addition of anti-TGF? mAb to culture did not inhibit Aza-induced Foxp3 expression, showing that serum TGF? was not required for Aza to inhibit DNMTs (not shown). Further, whereas TGF? induces Foxp3 expression in peripheral naive CD4+CD25? T cells ( 9 , 10 ), the results in Fig. 1 B showed that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer remained methylated in TGF?-induced Treg. Because TGF? does induce Foxp3, the combination of Aza plus TGF? was tested for Foxp3 induction. The results showed that Aza plus TGF? efficiently induced Foxp3 in 72% of T cells compared with 44% with TGF? alone, 35% with Aza alone, and 91% in control nTreg ( Fig. 2 B ). This effect was synergistic, so that expression was induced by even very low concentrations of Aza plus TGF? ( Fig. 2 C ) compared with Aza alone ( supplemental Fig. S2 A ). The other mechanistically and structurally diverse DNMT inhibitors RG108, hydralazine, and procainamide also induced Foxp3 expression in combination with TGF? ( Fig. 2 D ). Importantly, in our culture conditions Aza or Aza plus TGF? lead to complete demethylation of the Foxp3 CpG site, whereas the H19 promoter and AID first intronic region remained methylated ( Fig. 2, E and F ). The AID intronic region has been shown to be hypomethylated in germinal center B cells but hypermethylated and not expressed in T cells ( 30 ). Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg expressed similar levels of cytokine mRNA except for slightly increased IL-4 and IL-17 mRNA and a greater increase in IL-10 mRNA compared with nTreg ( supplemental Fig. S2 D ), and expressed similar surface markers, except for slight decreases in CD28, CD62L, and CD122 (IL-2R?) ( supplemental Fig. S2 E ). Thus, Aza induced demethylation of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer to allow enhanced Foxp3 expression and subsequent downstream effects of induction of Foxp3-dependent, Treg-restricted sets of genesrather than indiscriminately activating many loci. Together, these results showed that Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg were similar to conventional nTreg.  Demethylation of upstream Foxp3 enhancer induces Foxp3 expression Because there was differential methylation of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer in T cell subsets, we determined whether the site could be demethylated and Foxp3 expression induced with the DNMT inhibitor Aza, an anticancer drug known as decitabine, that can induce the expression of methylated genes ( 29 ). Aza induced Foxp3 protein and mRNA expression in naive CD4+CD25? T cells ( Fig. 2 A ) in a dose- ( supplemental Fig. S2 A ) and time-dependent fashion ( supplemental Fig. S2, B and C ). The addition of anti-TGF? mAb to culture did not inhibit Aza-induced Foxp3 expression, showing that serum TGF? was not required for Aza to inhibit DNMTs (not shown). Further, whereas TGF? induces Foxp3 expression in peripheral naive CD4+CD25? T cells ( 9 , 10 ), the results in Fig. 1 B showed that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer remained methylated in TGF?-induced Treg. Because TGF? does induce Foxp3, the combination of Aza plus TGF? was tested for Foxp3 induction. The results showed that Aza plus TGF? efficiently induced Foxp3 in 72% of T cells compared with 44% with TGF? alone, 35% with Aza alone, and 91% in control nTreg ( Fig. 2 B ). This effect was synergistic, so that expression was induced by even very low concentrations of Aza plus TGF? ( Fig. 2 C ) compared with Aza alone ( supplemental Fig. S2 A ). The other mechanistically and structurally diverse DNMT inhibitors RG108, hydralazine, and procainamide also induced Foxp3 expression in combination with TGF? ( Fig. 2 D ). Importantly, in our culture conditions Aza or Aza plus TGF? lead to complete demethylation of the Foxp3 CpG site, whereas the H19 promoter and AID first intronic region remained methylated ( Fig. 2, E and F ). The AID intronic region has been shown to be hypomethylated in germinal center B cells but hypermethylated and not expressed in T cells ( 30 ). Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg expressed similar levels of cytokine mRNA except for slightly increased IL-4 and IL-17 mRNA and a greater increase in IL-10 mRNA compared with nTreg ( supplemental Fig. S2 D ), and expressed similar surface markers, except for slight decreases in CD28, CD62L, and CD122 (IL-2R?) ( supplemental Fig. S2 E ). Thus, Aza induced demethylation of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer to allow enhanced Foxp3 expression and subsequent downstream effects of induction of Foxp3-dependent, Treg-restricted sets of genesrather than indiscriminately activating many loci. Together, these results showed that Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg were similar to conventional nTreg.  Upstream Foxp3 enhancer is occupied by DNMTs and transcriptional repressors DNA methylation is performed by three known DNMTs: DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b. ChIP assays for DNMTs showed that nTreg had >8-fold difference in DNMT1 and >12-fold difference in DNMT3b binding to the upstream Foxp3 enhancer CpG island compared with naive CD4+ T cells ( Fig. 3 A ), whereas there was no significant difference in DNMT3a binding ( supplemental Fig. S3 ). The results for Aza plus TGF? Treg were similar to those of nTreg. Importantly, TGF?-induced Treg had much greater binding of DNMT1 and DNMT3b compared with nTreg or Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg ( Fig. 3 A ). This suggested that DNMT1 and DNMT3b were recruited to the upstream Foxp3 enhancer to maintain CpG methylation in naive CD4+ T cells and TGF?-induced Treg. There was similar differential binding of the transcriptional repressors MBD2 and MeCP2 to this same site in naive CD4+CD25? T cells, activated T cells, and TGF?-induced Treg compared with Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg or nTreg ( Fig. 3, B and C ). To further assess the upstream Foxp3 enhancer activity, the sequence was cloned into a vector with an SV40 minimal promoter and luciferase reporter activity was measured after transfection into the BW5147.3 T cell lymphoma line. This upstream Foxp3 enhancer induced ~30-fold reporter activity compared with the control vector ( Fig. 3 D ). Cotransfection of DNMT1, DNMT3a, or DNMT3b1 inhibited enhancer activity, suggesting that methylation repressed transcriptional activity ( Fig. 3 E ). To demonstrate that inhibition of enhancer activity was due to methylation of the enhancer and not the vector backbone, the upstream Foxp3 enhancer was first methylated in vitro, ligated into the pGL3 promoter vector, and then enhancer activity was monitored after transfection into the BW5147.3 cell line. The results show that in vitro methylation inhibits upstream Foxp3 enhancer activity ( Fig. 3 F ).  Upstream Foxp3 enhancer is occupied by DNMTs and transcriptional repressors DNA methylation is performed by three known DNMTs: DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b. ChIP assays for DNMTs showed that nTreg had >8-fold difference in DNMT1 and >12-fold difference in DNMT3b binding to the upstream Foxp3 enhancer CpG island compared with naive CD4+ T cells ( Fig. 3 A ), whereas there was no significant difference in DNMT3a binding ( supplemental Fig. S3 ). The results for Aza plus TGF? Treg were similar to those of nTreg. Importantly, TGF?-induced Treg had much greater binding of DNMT1 and DNMT3b compared with nTreg or Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg ( Fig. 3 A ). This suggested that DNMT1 and DNMT3b were recruited to the upstream Foxp3 enhancer to maintain CpG methylation in naive CD4+ T cells and TGF?-induced Treg. There was similar differential binding of the transcriptional repressors MBD2 and MeCP2 to this same site in naive CD4+CD25? T cells, activated T cells, and TGF?-induced Treg compared with Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg or nTreg ( Fig. 3, B and C ). To further assess the upstream Foxp3 enhancer activity, the sequence was cloned into a vector with an SV40 minimal promoter and luciferase reporter activity was measured after transfection into the BW5147.3 T cell lymphoma line. This upstream Foxp3 enhancer induced ~30-fold reporter activity compared with the control vector ( Fig. 3 D ). Cotransfection of DNMT1, DNMT3a, or DNMT3b1 inhibited enhancer activity, suggesting that methylation repressed transcriptional activity ( Fig. 3 E ). To demonstrate that inhibition of enhancer activity was due to methylation of the enhancer and not the vector backbone, the upstream Foxp3 enhancer was first methylated in vitro, ligated into the pGL3 promoter vector, and then enhancer activity was monitored after transfection into the BW5147.3 cell line. The results show that in vitro methylation inhibits upstream Foxp3 enhancer activity ( Fig. 3 F ).  Sp1 and TIEG1 binding and histone 3 acetylation in Treg subsets Actively transcribed genes have demethylated CpG islands, and the GC box is occupied by the transcription factor Sp1 ( 31 , 32 ). To determine the binding of Sp1 to this enhancer, ChIP analyses were performed. In nTreg and Aza plus TGF? Treg this CpG site was occupied by Sp1, but not in naive CD4+CD25? T cells, activated CD4+ T cells, or TGF?-induced Treg ( Fig. 4 A ). The specificity of binding of Sp1 to the sequence was confirmed by EMSA ( Fig. 4 B ). This suggests that Sp1 binds the upstream Foxp3 enhancer and is involved in the function of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer. Histone acetylation is an additional feature of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation ( 24 , 33 ). ChIP assays for acetylated histone 3 (AcH3) showed that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer was acetylated in nTreg (>4.5-fold) and Aza plus TGF? induced Treg (~3-fold), but not in activated CD4+ T cells (~1.5-fold) or TGF?-induced Treg (~1.1-fold) ( Fig. 4 C ). Analysis predicted that upstream Foxp3 enhancer possesses numerous TIEG1, EGR1, and AP-2a binding sites. TIEG1 and EGR1 are homologous and transcribed from differentially regulated, alternative promoters but use common exons in most all of their coding regions ( 34 ). Recently it has been shown that TIEG1 plays role in the Foxp3 expression and Treg function ( 35 ). ChIP analysis for TIEG1 showed significant binding to the upstream Foxp3 enhancer in Aza plus TGF? induced Treg and nTreg compared with naive CD4+CD25? T cells, activated T cells, or TGF?-induced Treg ( Fig. 4 D ). In contrast, AP-2a and EGR1 were not differentially bound in these subsets ( supplemental Fig. S3, B and C ). To show that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer is unique in its regulation, we also analyzed the Foxp3 proximal promoter located at the transcriptional start site ( 36 ). There was no significant difference in histone acetylation at this site between TGF? or Aza plus TGF? Treg ( Fig. 4 C ), whereas nTreg had increased acetylation at this site (10-fold). Likewise, by ChIP assay there was no significant difference in pSmad2/3 binding between TGF?-induced or Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg at the Smad consensus site ( Fig. 4 E ), although nTreg had increased binding (~8-fold). The role of TGF? signaling was confirmed in Smad3?/? cells, where TGF?-induced but not Aza-induced Foxp3 expression was inhibited compared with Smad3+/+ controls ( Fig. 4 F ). Importantly, the generation of thymic-derived nTreg is not affected in TGF?1?/? or Smad3?/? mice ( 37 ). Thus, the Foxp3 proximal promoter structure and responsiveness to TGF? differs between nTreg and other Treg subsets, whereas the upstream Foxp3 enhancer is similar only between nTreg and Aza-induced Treg, suggesting that the upstream enhancer activity is specifically involved in nTreg but not in TGF?-induced peripheral Treg generation and function.  Sp1 and TIEG1 binding and histone 3 acetylation in Treg subsets Actively transcribed genes have demethylated CpG islands, and the GC box is occupied by the transcription factor Sp1 ( 31 , 32 ). To determine the binding of Sp1 to this enhancer, ChIP analyses were performed. In nTreg and Aza plus TGF? Treg this CpG site was occupied by Sp1, but not in naive CD4+CD25? T cells, activated CD4+ T cells, or TGF?-induced Treg ( Fig. 4 A ). The specificity of binding of Sp1 to the sequence was confirmed by EMSA ( Fig. 4 B ). This suggests that Sp1 binds the upstream Foxp3 enhancer and is involved in the function of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer. Histone acetylation is an additional feature of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation ( 24 , 33 ). ChIP assays for acetylated histone 3 (AcH3) showed that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer was acetylated in nTreg (>4.5-fold) and Aza plus TGF? induced Treg (~3-fold), but not in activated CD4+ T cells (~1.5-fold) or TGF?-induced Treg (~1.1-fold) ( Fig. 4 C ). Analysis predicted that upstream Foxp3 enhancer possesses numerous TIEG1, EGR1, and AP-2a binding sites. TIEG1 and EGR1 are homologous and transcribed from differentially regulated, alternative promoters but use common exons in most all of their coding regions ( 34 ). Recently it has been shown that TIEG1 plays role in the Foxp3 expression and Treg function ( 35 ). ChIP analysis for TIEG1 showed significant binding to the upstream Foxp3 enhancer in Aza plus TGF? induced Treg and nTreg compared with naive CD4+CD25? T cells, activated T cells, or TGF?-induced Treg ( Fig. 4 D ). In contrast, AP-2a and EGR1 were not differentially bound in these subsets ( supplemental Fig. S3, B and C ). To show that the upstream Foxp3 enhancer is unique in its regulation, we also analyzed the Foxp3 proximal promoter located at the transcriptional start site ( 36 ). There was no significant difference in histone acetylation at this site between TGF? or Aza plus TGF? Treg ( Fig. 4 C ), whereas nTreg had increased acetylation at this site (10-fold). Likewise, by ChIP assay there was no significant difference in pSmad2/3 binding between TGF?-induced or Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg at the Smad consensus site ( Fig. 4 E ), although nTreg had increased binding (~8-fold). The role of TGF? signaling was confirmed in Smad3?/? cells, where TGF?-induced but not Aza-induced Foxp3 expression was inhibited compared with Smad3+/+ controls ( Fig. 4 F ). Importantly, the generation of thymic-derived nTreg is not affected in TGF?1?/? or Smad3?/? mice ( 37 ). Thus, the Foxp3 proximal promoter structure and responsiveness to TGF? differs between nTreg and other Treg subsets, whereas the upstream Foxp3 enhancer is similar only between nTreg and Aza-induced Treg, suggesting that the upstream enhancer activity is specifically involved in nTreg but not in TGF?-induced peripheral Treg generation and function.  IL-6 decreases Foxp3 expression and increases upstream Foxp3 enhancer CpG methylation in nTreg IL-6 regulates the reciprocal development of Treg and Th17 ( 38 ) and inhibits Foxp3 expression and suppressive function in nTreg ( 39 , 40 ). To determine whether the IL-6-induced loss of Foxp3 is due to changes in the upstream Foxp3 enhancer structure and transcription, highly purified CD4+CD25+ T cells were purified using flow cytometry ( Fig. 5 A ). Purified nTreg were cultured with or without IL-6 and results showed that IL-6 inhibited both Foxp3 protein ( Fig. 5 A ) and mRNA expression in nTreg ( Fig. 5 B ). To confirm that the increase in Foxp3?CD4+ T cells was not due to overgrowth of Foxp3? T cells present at the initiation of culture, CD4+Foxp3gfp+ nTreg (90%) (CD45.2) were stimulated along with congenically marked naive CD4+CD25?CD45.1+ cells (10%) in the presence or absence of IL-6 for 4 days. IL-6 down-regulated Foxp3gfp in CD4+CD45.1? nTreg ( supplemental Fig. S4 ), whereas the total percentage of CD4+CD45.1+ cells did not change significantly (IL-2, anti-CD3?: 11.5%; IL-2, anti-CD3?, TGF?: 12.9%; IL-2, anti-CD3?, TGF?, IL-6: 8.61%), showing that the IL-6-induced increase in Foxp3? cells is not due to over-growth of CD4+Foxp3? T cells. ChIP analysis showed IL-6-induced deacetylation of histone 3 at the upstream Foxp3 enhancer ( Fig. 5 C ). To examine IL-6-induced inhibition in Foxp3 expression, Foxp3gfp+ nTreg were purified from Foxp3gfp reporter mice. These purified CD4+Foxp3gfp+ nTreg cultured with IL-6 and TGF?, and ~20% of the cells down-regulated Foxp3gfp expression. Analyses of purified subsets showed increased DNMT1 binding ( Fig. 5 D ) and methylation of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer ( Fig. 5, E and F ) and repression of Foxp3 transcription ( Fig. 5 G ) in Foxp3gfp? cells compared with Foxp3gfp+ CD4 T cells. In the same cultures we did not observe IL-17 mRNA expression in the Foxp3gfp? or Foxp3gfp+ T cells (data not shown). Importantly, IL-6 did not inhibit Foxp3 expression in STAT3-deficient nTreg ( Fig. 5 H ), showing that IL-6-induced CpG methylation and inhibition of Foxp3 expression are STAT3 dependent.  IL-6 decreases Foxp3 expression and increases upstream Foxp3 enhancer CpG methylation in nTreg IL-6 regulates the reciprocal development of Treg and Th17 ( 38 ) and inhibits Foxp3 expression and suppressive function in nTreg ( 39 , 40 ). To determine whether the IL-6-induced loss of Foxp3 is due to changes in the upstream Foxp3 enhancer structure and transcription, highly purified CD4+CD25+ T cells were purified using flow cytometry ( Fig. 5 A ). Purified nTreg were cultured with or without IL-6 and results showed that IL-6 inhibited both Foxp3 protein ( Fig. 5 A ) and mRNA expression in nTreg ( Fig. 5 B ). To confirm that the increase in Foxp3?CD4+ T cells was not due to overgrowth of Foxp3? T cells present at the initiation of culture, CD4+Foxp3gfp+ nTreg (90%) (CD45.2) were stimulated along with congenically marked naive CD4+CD25?CD45.1+ cells (10%) in the presence or absence of IL-6 for 4 days. IL-6 down-regulated Foxp3gfp in CD4+CD45.1? nTreg ( supplemental Fig. S4 ), whereas the total percentage of CD4+CD45.1+ cells did not change significantly (IL-2, anti-CD3?: 11.5%; IL-2, anti-CD3?, TGF?: 12.9%; IL-2, anti-CD3?, TGF?, IL-6: 8.61%), showing that the IL-6-induced increase in Foxp3? cells is not due to over-growth of CD4+Foxp3? T cells. ChIP analysis showed IL-6-induced deacetylation of histone 3 at the upstream Foxp3 enhancer ( Fig. 5 C ). To examine IL-6-induced inhibition in Foxp3 expression, Foxp3gfp+ nTreg were purified from Foxp3gfp reporter mice. These purified CD4+Foxp3gfp+ nTreg cultured with IL-6 and TGF?, and ~20% of the cells down-regulated Foxp3gfp expression. Analyses of purified subsets showed increased DNMT1 binding ( Fig. 5 D ) and methylation of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer ( Fig. 5, E and F ) and repression of Foxp3 transcription ( Fig. 5 G ) in Foxp3gfp? cells compared with Foxp3gfp+ CD4 T cells. In the same cultures we did not observe IL-17 mRNA expression in the Foxp3gfp? or Foxp3gfp+ T cells (data not shown). Importantly, IL-6 did not inhibit Foxp3 expression in STAT3-deficient nTreg ( Fig. 5 H ), showing that IL-6-induced CpG methylation and inhibition of Foxp3 expression are STAT3 dependent.  Characterization of Foxp3 induction and maintenance by Aza Because DNMT inhibition by Aza is most effective in actively proliferating cells ( 41 , 42 ), the timing of Aza exposure was examined. The results showed that 24 h of exposure starting at culture initiation, but not later times, was required to induce maximal Foxp3 expression ( Fig. 6 A , and data not shown). Thus, DNMT inhibition was required early and briefly during the initial proliferative cycle. Monitoring expression with respect to proliferation (CFSE dilution) showed that Foxp3 was expressed early after the initial division in TGF? Treg and Aza plus TGF? Treg, and Foxp3 did not increase or accumulate with more division cycles ( Fig. 6 B ). A gene dosage effect was not observed in male compared with female cells (data not shown). Apoptosis, proliferation, and cell accumulation were not significantly different in ZyCyd plus TGF?-induced Treg compared with TGF?-induced Treg ( supplemental Fig. S5 A ). To measure the stability of expression, Tregwere generated, purified, and recultured. The Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg maintained a much higher percentage of Foxp3+ cells compared with TGF?-induced Treg ( Fig. 6 C ). Activated T cells that have undergone other differentiation pathways do not usually differentiate toward the Foxp3+ Treg fate ( 43 ). Because Aza might reprogram cells by altering gene methylation, we determined whether previously activated cells could be induced to express Foxp3. CD4+CD25? T cells were stimulated, rested, and then restimulated with Aza. Preactivated T cells could not be induced to express Foxp3 ( supplemental Fig. S5 B ), although they were very sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of Aza treatment (data not shown). Other time intervals for primary stimulation followed by re-stimulation with Aza did not induce Foxp3 expression (data not shown). Further analysis showed that Aza could not induce strong Foxp3 expression in CD4+CD44highCD62Llow (memory) T cells in combination with TGF? but did so in CD4+CD44lowCD62Lhigh (naive) T cells ( Fig. 6 D ), suggesting that apart from CpG demethylation, there were other dominant pathways and factors that played essential roles in Foxp3 expression. To determine whether other signals influenced Aza and TGF?-driven Treg differentiation or whether Aza influenced T cell differentiation to other lineages, cultures were established that incorporated Aza and other Th conditions. The results showed that IL-6 along with TGF? (Th17 conditions) inhibited Foxp3 expression, whereas Th1 and Th2 cytokines had only minor effects on Foxp3 expression in combination with TGF? and Aza ( Fig. 6 E ). Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines were measured in their cognate culture conditions. Aza increased the expression of IFN-? in Th1 and IL-4 in Th2 cultures, but not IL-17 in Th17 cultures ( Fig. 6 F ). Together, the results suggested that DNMT inhibition is most effective at driving T cells into the Treg lineage ( Fig. 6 E ), but that this strategy may be used to drive some but not all other lineages.  Characterization of Foxp3 induction and maintenance by Aza Because DNMT inhibition by Aza is most effective in actively proliferating cells ( 41 , 42 ), the timing of Aza exposure was examined. The results showed that 24 h of exposure starting at culture initiation, but not later times, was required to induce maximal Foxp3 expression ( Fig. 6 A , and data not shown).

Further analysis showed that Aza could not induce strong Foxp3 expression in CD4+CD44highCD62Llow (memory) T cells in combination with TGF? but did so in CD4+CD44lowCD62Lhigh (naive) T cells ( Fig. 6 D ), suggesting that apart from CpG demethylation, there were other dominant pathways and factors that played essential roles in Foxp3 expression. To determine whether other signals influenced Aza and TGF?-driven Treg differentiation or whether Aza influenced T cell differentiation to other lineages, cultures were established that incorporated Aza and other Th conditions. The results showed that IL-6 along with TGF? (Th17 conditions) inhibited Foxp3 expression, whereas Th1 and Th2 cytokines had only minor effects on Foxp3 expression in combination with TGF? and Aza ( Fig. 6 E ). Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines were measured in their cognate culture conditions. Aza increased the expression of IFN-? in Th1 and IL-4 in Th2 cultures, but not IL-17 in Th17 cultures ( Fig. 6 F ). Together, the results suggested that DNMT inhibition is most effective at driving T cells into the Treg lineage ( Fig. 6 E ), but that this strategy may be used to drive some but not all other lineages.  Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg are suppressive Because Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg resembled conventional nTreg ( supplemental Fig. S2, D and E ), their functional activities were evaluated. Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg inhibited proliferation of CD4+CD25? T cells ( Fig. 7 A ) and were similar in potency to nTreg. Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg inhibited CD4+CD25? CD45RBhigh T cell-induced colitis and splenomegaly in CB17. SCID ( Fig. 7, B and C ), and recipients sustained ~2-fold more splenic Foxp3+ T cells over time compared with mice that received TGF?-induced Treg ( supplemental Fig. S6 ). Adoptive transfer of Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg also prolonged pancreatic islet allograft survival ( Fig. 7 D ). Together, the results demonstrated potent and stable suppressor function.  Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg are suppressive Because Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg resembled conventional nTreg ( supplemental Fig. S2, D and E ), their functional activities were evaluated. Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg inhibited proliferation of CD4+CD25? T cells ( Fig. 7 A ) and were similar in potency to nTreg. Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg inhibited CD4+CD25? CD45RBhigh T cell-induced colitis and splenomegaly in CB17. SCID ( Fig. 7, B and C ), and recipients sustained ~2-fold more splenic Foxp3+ T cells over time compared with mice that received TGF?-induced Treg ( supplemental Fig. S6 ). Adoptive transfer of Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg also prolonged pancreatic islet allograft survival ( Fig. 7 D ). Together, the results demonstrated potent and stable suppressor function.  Aza plus TGF? induce suppressive Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> human T cells CD4+CD25? T cells were isolated from human PBMC and cultured in the presence of IL-2, anti-CD3? mAb, TGF?, and Aza for 6 days. Aza plus TGF? induced a higher percentage of Foxp3+ cells (67%) ( Fig. 8 A ), a greater number of Foxp3 bright cells (48.8%), and enhanced Foxp3 gene expression compared with TGF? alone (36.4%) ( Fig. 8 B ). Foxp3 is an activation marker but not an exclusive Treg marker in man, so human TGF?-induced Treg are not necessarily anergic or suppressive ( 44 ). To determine whether Aza also induced regulatory function, a suppression assay was performed. Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg were almost as suppressive as CD4+CD25+ nTreg, whereas TGF?-induced Treg had less suppressive potency, particularly at higher cell ratios ( Fig. 8 C ). This suggested that low Foxp3 expression in IL-2 plus anti-CD3? mAb or IL-2 plus anti-CD3? mAb plus TGF?-stimulated human T cells were not sufficient for conversion to functional suppressive Treg activity ( Fig. 8, A and B ).  Aza plus TGF? induce suppressive Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> human T cells CD4+CD25? T cells were isolated from human PBMC and cultured in the presence of IL-2, anti-CD3? mAb, TGF?, and Aza for 6 days. Aza plus TGF? induced a higher percentage of Foxp3+ cells (67%) ( Fig. 8 A ), a greater number of Foxp3 bright cells (48.8%), and enhanced Foxp3 gene expression compared with TGF? alone (36.4%) ( Fig. 8 B ). Foxp3 is an activation marker but not an exclusive Treg marker in man, so human TGF?-induced Treg are not necessarily anergic or suppressive ( 44 ). To determine whether Aza also induced regulatory function, a suppression assay was performed. Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg were almost as suppressive as CD4+CD25+ nTreg, whereas TGF?-induced Treg had less suppressive potency, particularly at higher cell ratios ( Fig. 8 C ). This suggested that low Foxp3 expression in IL-2 plus anti-CD3? mAb or IL-2 plus anti-CD3? mAb plus TGF?-stimulated human T cells were not sufficient for conversion to functional suppressive Treg activity ( Fig. 8, A and B ).  Discussion This study demonstrated differential Foxp3 gene regulation and structure in nTreg compared with TGF?-induced Treg or other naive or activated CD4+ T cells. There is a unique and highly conserved upstream CpG-rich enhancer in the Foxp3 gene that was demethylated and highly active in nTreg but methylated in TGF?-induced peripheral Treg. Sp1, AcH3, TIEG1, MeCP2, MBD2, DNMT1, and DNMT3b were central elements for its function and structure and were differentially bound to this site in nTreg compared with TGF?-induced Treg. Importantly, the use of a DNMT inhibitor demethylated and activated the upstream Foxp3 enhancer to induce Foxp3 expression and subsequently allowed the induction of Foxp3-dependent, Treg-restricted sets of genes. Demethylation acted synergistically with TGF? to convert a variety of naive T cells to Treg with high Foxp3 expression and potent, stable suppressive function. Conversely, IL-6 induced methylation of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer and repression of Foxp3 expression. Some structural and development differences between nTreg and TGF?-induced peripheral Treg have been shown in other analyses ( 7 , 16 , 19 ). TGF? partially down-regulates CpG methylation of the Foxp3 proximal promoter and an intronic enhancer so that TCR-induced CREB/ATF bind to the demethylated intronic enhancer ( 7 ), suggesting a role in TGF? Treg. However, nTreg had greater transcriptional activity and demethylation compared with TGF?-induced Treg ( 7 , 16 ) suggesting other as yet undefined regulatory signals. A second non-CpG intronic enhancer region is responsive to NFAT and Smad3 in both nTreg and TGF? Treg ( 19 ), suggesting a role for TCR or perhaps other signals. Smad3?/?, dominant negative TGF? receptor II, or TGF?1?/? mice do not have defects in the development of thymic-derived nTreg ( 37 , 45 , 46 ), suggesting that TGF? is involved only in peripheral Treg generation. However, a recent report demonstrated a critical role for TGF? receptor I, yet this requirement could be bypassed by IL-2/IL-2R signaling ( 47 ). Our data demonstrated additional differences between these Treg subsets at the proximal promoter near the transcriptional start site so that nTreg had greater TGF?-regulated Smad2/3 signaling and histone 3 acetylation. This latter finding is consistent with the recent report that inhibition of HDAC induces Foxp3 expression in T cells ( 48 ). However, studies using specific genetic knockouts of Foxp3 intronic or upstream enhancers will provide more insight about the regulation of Foxp3 transcription and Treg function. Our data demonstrated an important upstream Foxp3 enhancer ~5 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site. This element was differentially methylated and active, comparing nTreg and TGF?-induced peripheral Treg. In contrast to the proximal promoter and intronic enhancer, TGF? did not regulate its structure or function. Aza demethylated this element, inducing gene expression and a cellular phenotype that closely resembled that of nTreg. In a different system, Aza induced Foxp3 in human NK cells through an IL-2/IL-2R/STAT5-dependent mechanism ( 49 ), as well as demethylating the intronic Foxp3 enhancer ( 18 ), supporting our findings that Aza acted independently of TGF? signaling. IL-2/IL-2R/STAT5 signaling is required for Treg development and Foxp3 expression ( 8 ), although their precise effects on gene structure and transcription are not currently known. There are 11 STAT5 binding sites predicted close to the Foxp3 proximal promoter, and three sites highly conserved in mammals are transcriptionally active ( 8 ). It has been reported that Th1/Th2-polarized T cells do not express Foxp3 after stimulation with TGF? ( 50 , 51 ), but in the current study we show that culturing such cells in the presence of Aza can induce Foxp3 expression. Together, these findings suggest that, like the Th1 and Th2 loci ( 20 ), there is a Treg locus with several regions, epigenetically regulated and involved in the development of nTreg ( supplemental Fig. S7 ). Activated T cells express high levels of STAT3 that induce the transcription of DNMT1 ( 52 ), and high levels of DNMT1 may repress Foxp3 expression in preactivated or differentiated T cells ( 53 ). It is noteworthy that IL-6 signals via STAT3, resulting in methylation of the upstream Foxp3 enhancer and repression of Foxp3 expression. Our results demonstrated that TGF? did not induce Foxp3 in resting memory CD4+ T cells, whereas Aza induced only low-level Foxp3 expression. Inhibition of DNMTs in preactivated CD4+ T cells also did not induce Foxp3. This suggests that other dominant factors were essential for Foxp3 transcription so that DNMT inhibitors do not lead to T cell reprogramming of previously differentiated T cells. Results with Th1, Th2, and Th17 culture conditions showed that DNMT inhibition potentiated other T cell differentiative pathways, although the preferred effect favored Foxp3 expression and the Treg lineage. It is interesting to speculate that this class of drugs induces Foxp3+ Treg during cancer therapy, perhaps synergizing with tumor-produced TGF?, which is associated with failure of immunotherapy and with tumor progression ( 3 ). Our results also imply that IL-6 could inhibit or even reverse the development of such Treg. Foxp3 expression in human CD4+ T cells does not necessarily denote a regulatory phenotype ( 44 , 54 ). Human T cells express two Foxp3 isoforms, and enhanced expression is required for regulatory effector function ( 55 ). The Foxp3 regulatory elements are methylated in TGF?-induced CD4+T cells ( 17 ), which might lead to low Foxp3 expression that is insufficient to imprint the regulatory phenotype. We showed that Aza enhanced Foxp3 expression in human CD4+ T cells and that Aza-induced Treg, but not TGF?-induced Treg, were suppressive. Our data and that of others demonstrated that even in the murine system there are differences between nTreg and TGF?-induced Treg in regulation of the Foxp3 expression and suppressor activity ( 7 , 16 ). This suggests that nTreg are more potent and stable suppressors than TGF?-induced Treg, and DNMT inhibition induces Treg that more closely resemble nTreg. Induced Treg have the potential to be used in clinical treatments ( 1 ). Using both TCR transgenic and nontransgenic cells, we demonstrated that large numbers of Treg could be generated with Ag-specific stimulation. We also demonstrated that Aza plus TGF?-induced Treg prevented autoimmune colitis and prolonged islet allograft survival. The techniques developed here are similar to protocols for adoptive transfer of leukocytes for bone marrow transplantation or immunotherapy. Further, our techniques used drugs and biologics such as IL-2, anti-CD3? mAb, and DNMT inhibitors for which there are already substantial clinical experience and regulatory approval. The combination of DNMT and HDAC inhibitors may further boost nTreg development ( 48 ).
