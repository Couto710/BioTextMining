Genetic variation in nitric oxide synthase 2A ( NOS2A ) and risk for multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) with a strong genetic component. Variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21, specifically the HLA-DRB1*15 haplotype, is the strongest genetic factor for MS, yet it is estimated to account for only a portion of risk for the disease. Previous evidence has implicated the nitric oxide synthase gene ( NOS2A ) encoding inducible NOS (inos) on chromosome 17q11 as a potential MS susceptibility gene. To determine whether variation in the NOS2A gene contributes to MS risk, we investigated a total of 50 polymorphisms within or flanking the locus for evidence of association using a comprehensive analytical strategy. A total of 6,265 members from 1,858 well-characterized MS families were utilized. No evidence for over-transmission of any individual SNP allele or haplotype to the MS affected individuals was observed. Furthermore, different transmission rates were not observed in either DRB1*15 positive or DRB1*15 negative family subgroups, or when extreme clinical outcomes characterizing disease progression were examined. The very largest study of NOS2A variation in MS, to date, excludes even a modest role for this locus in susceptibility.  Introduction Nitric oxide synthase 2A (NOS2A) catalyzes the synthesis of the free radical nitric oxide (NO), an important mediator of several physiologic processes, including regulation of vascular tone, host defense against parasites, immune-modulation, and neurotransmission. However, excessive amounts of NO in the brain have been linked to tissue injury and ensuing neurological symptoms as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction and direct killing of oligodendrocytes and axons 1 – 3 . For example, in the multiple sclerosis (MS) brain the transcriptional regulation of the NOS2A gene in activated microglia, astrocytes and macrophages is well documented 4 – 7 . Furthermore, chronic inactive non-inflammatory MS lesions, and even normal appearing white matter, have elevated concentrations of NO 8 , suggesting an effector role for this molecule in disease development. Aminoguanidine, a selective inhibitor of NO, prevented the clinical development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rodents with reduction of both inflammation and demyelination 9 , 10 . MS is a common neurologic disease with an important genetic component 11 . Given its functional profile, NOS2A has been considered by several authors to be a plausible disease susceptibility candidate gene. Moreover, its putative involvement in complex genetic disorders may go beyond autoimmune demyelination. Linkage in a subset of type I diabetes pedigrees ( HLA-DR3/4 positives) 12 and genetic associations with diabetic renopathy 13 , dementia with Lewy bodies 14 , coronary artery disease 15 , malaria 16 , 17 , and Parkinson’s disease 18 , 19 have been reported. We previously reported a NOS2A exon 10 SNP (C/T, D346D) being associated with disease susceptibility in two independent MS datasets 20 . Evidence for excess transmission of the T allele remained significant even after correction for multiple testing in HLA-DRB1*15 positive families. Because the associated SNP confers a synonymous coding change, and other smaller NOS2A studies in MS have either suggested trends 21 , 22 or failed to detect an association 23 – 25 , much larger studies are needed to confidently confirm or exclude a role for this important locus in disease susceptibility. NOS2A maps to 17q11 and comprises 27 exons with translation initiation and termination codons in exon 2 and exon 27, respectively 26 . The largest familial MS dataset, to date, was assembled for this study, including more than 2,100 MS cases and over 6,200 family members, to comprehensively investigate the NOS2A locus in MS. No significant association was detected.  Materials and Methods To determine whether NOS2A variation might play a role in susceptibility to MS, we analyzed a total of 50 unique polymorphisms across the NOS2A locus and flanking genomic regions. A comprehensive analytical approach ( Figure 1 ) was utilized that included a total of 1,858 unique families (2,159 MS cases, 4,106 unaffected family members) of European descent recruited from the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) and maximized use of all available genetic data ( Table 1 ). A total of 427 US families from the original study were included 20 . The diagnostic criteria, ascertainment protocols and clinical and demographic characteristics of these populations are described in more detail elsewhere 30 , 31 , 35 , 44 . The expanded disability status score or EDSS 45 was used in conjunction with disease duration to define very mild or severe forms of MS as a secondary phenotype for analysis, as previously described 31 . Disease duration was measured as the number of years between the year of onset of first symptom and year of last exam with EDSS assessment; in most cases this is at entry of study, given the cross sectional nature of these datasets. Mild disease (the ability to walk normally or have only mild gait disability) was defined as those cases with an EDSS ?3 after 15 years. Severe disease (need for bilateral assistance to walk or wheelchair dependency), included cases who reached an EDSS >6, within 10 years of disease duration. Appropriate institutional review boards approved this study and all participants gave written informed consent. Genotyping and Quality Control Analysis 1 The promoter region (8.3 kb), 27 exons and all exon-intron junctions of the NOS2A gene (43.7 kb) were re-sequenced in 20 Caucasian MS cases to confirm reported SNPs and identify new SNPs. Primer sequences were designed using Oligo 6.8 software (Molecular Biology Insights, Inc., Cascade, CO) and ordered from Operon Biotechnologies, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50µl containing 20ng DNA, 1× AmpliTaq Gold Buffer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 0.5µM NOS2A region specific forward and reverse primers, 0.8mM dNTP mix, 2.5 units AmpliTaqGold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and 1.5–3.5mM MgCl2. Amplification was carried out in a PTC-100 Thermal Controller (MJ Research, Inc.) with an initial 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 1 minute, 57–61°C for 1 minute and 72°C for 1 minute ( Table S1 ). The products were then purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit under manufacturer’s conditions (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The purified samples were sent to the UC San Francisco Core Facility for sequencing. Direct sequencing was employed to identify sequence variation. Sequence data were analyzed using Sequencher 4.8 software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI). A total of 52 SNPs were identified within the NOS2A locus. Using a minor allele frequency (MAF) cut-off = 0.1, a total of 41 from 52 SNPs were chosen for genotyping ( Table S2 ) in 203 unrelated individuals from the US MS families. All SNPs were designed using ABI custom TaqMan assays on File Builder 2.0 software. Analysis of haplotype block structure defined by the 41 SNPs identified a total of 15 loci as tagging SNPs for six haplotype blocks within the NOS2A locus ( Figure 2 ). A total of 1,648 MS families (N=5,635 total individuals; N=1,949 MS cases) including 1,372 full trio families were genotyped for the 15 tagging NOS2A SNPs using the same genotyping assays. Sequenced base control DNA samples were included for each 384-well plate to ensure genotyping accuracy and reproducibility (>99%). All MS families were examined for Mendelian inconsistencies using PEDCHECK 46 and any discrepancies were addressed through re-genotyping or omission from the analyses when problems could not be resolved. A full description of NOS2A region SNPs, including location, MAF and all results from HWE tests are included in Table S3 . Analysis 2 Genetic data derived for 930 MS trios (N=3,060 individuals, 930 MS cases) for 40 NOS2A locus or nearby SNPs were included in this study. Genotyping was performed using a DNA microarray (GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Sample preparation, and quality control measures for both genotyping and DNA samples, including exclusion criteria based on Mendelian error rate have been previously described 35 . Only SNP markers with MAF ? 0.05 were included in this study. A full description of NOS2A region SNPs, including location, MAF and all results from HWE tests are included in Table S3 . Analysis 3 Genotype data (a total of 50 unique NOS2A region SNPs) derived from Analysis 1 and Analysis 2 were combined for a comprehensive assessment of NOS2A variation. A total of 720 MS families (N=2,160 individuals, 720 MS cases) were available for analysis. The total NOS2A region coverage was 335 kb; marker density = one SNP/6.9 kb. The marker density for the NOS2A gene, specifically, (spanning 46 kb), was one SNP/2.0 kb. Cross-platform validation was performed for three NOS2A SNPs (rs3729508, rs944724, and rs2734299) that were genotyped and evaluated for a total of 2,160 individuals using both Affymetrix and Taqman platforms. A low error rate (<0.5%) was observed when individual genotypes were compared, demonstrating that genotypes derived from both platforms were concordant (data not shown). <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> genotyping DRB1*15 carrier status was available for 1,114 of total 2,159 MS cases (51.9 %) included in this study. Medium-resolution typing of HLA-DRB1 (two to four digits) was performed as previously described 31 , 44 . A total of six of 1,045 MS cases without HLA-DRB1 genotype data were genotyped for the rs3135388 (A/G) SNP to identify the MS-associated DRB1*15 allele, since the presence of this allele and the rs3135388A SNP are highly correlated 47 , 48 . Our own previous work based on data from 2,750 individuals demonstrates > 99% concordance between DRB1*15 and rs3135388A 35 . Therefore a total of 1,120 families were stratified for NOS2A single SNP and haplotype analyses in order to detect differences that might be present between these two subgroups defined by DRB1*15 status. Statistical Analysis All NOS2A SNP genotypes were tested for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectations in unrelated family founders and MS cases using HAPLOVIEW (v.4.0) 49 . Markers were excluded if p<0.01 in either group. One marker was dropped from final analyses. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) measures (D’ and r2) and significance were calculated using HAPLOVIEW (v.4.0) 49 and standard parameters were used for characterization of haplotype blocks and initial identification of tag SNPs (Analysis 1) 50 . Family-based analyses of single NOS2A SNPs were performed using the pedigree disequilibrium test or PDT (v.5.1) 51 , 52 . The PDT is a powerful analytical method that uses genetic data from related nuclear families and discordant sibships within extended pedigrees. Two PDT statistics were used: the PDT-sum statistic which examines allelic effects, and the genotype-PDT that examines genotypic effects. All trio MS families were analyzed for single SNP associations using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) 53 implemented in HAPLOVIEW (v.4.0) 49 . Family-based analyses of variation in haplotype blocks in MS trios was performed using algorithms implemented in HAPLOVIEW (v.4.0) to identify block structure for haplotype assessment, and the UNPHASED (v.3.0.10) 54 software to perform global tests for haplotype association. For UNPHASED, the TDT-uncertain option was used, which implements unconditional logistic regression on the full likelihood of parents and offspring as previously described. 55 . The EM algorithm implemented in UNPHASED was used to obtain maximium-likelihood estimates of case (transmitted) and control (non-transmitted) parental haplotype frequencies under both null and alternative hypotheses. For ‘N’ haplotypes, the global test is a N-1 degree-of-freedom test, jointly testing all haplotypes. Mild (total N=101) and severe (total N=104) MS cases were also compared for differences in NOS2A SNP allele and haplotype frequencies using HAPLOVIEW (v. 4.0) 49 . A type 1 error rate (?) of 0.001 was utilized for interpretation of results, and was based on: (1) the number of statistical tests performed in this study, and (2) the fact that this was an investigation of a previously implicated candidate gene (strong apriori evidence for association). The Tagger algorithm in HAPLOVIEW (v. 4.0) was used with our genotype data to evaluate tagged (but untyped) NOS2A SNPs based on HapMap CEU data ( www.hapmap.org ) and r2 ? 0.80 as previously described 57 . Statistical Power Based on our family sample sizes ranging from 720–1,648 trios, we calculated power for TDT analyses under a multiplicative model using the TDT Power Calculator ( http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~wmchen/pc.html ) as previously described 57 . We assumed a very conservative type 1 error rate of 0.1% (?=0.001, based on multiple tests in the current investigation), and complete linkage disequilibrium between marker and disease allele (? =1). We also considered an allele or haplotype frequency range of 0.1–0.5. Based on these assumptions, our analyses of NOS2A SNPs and haplotypes in 1,648 trios had > 95% power to detect very modest genotype relative risks (GRRs) of 1.3 and 1.5 for allele or haplotype frequencies as low as 0.3 and 0.1, respectively. Similar results for statistical power were observed for samples sizes of both 720 and 930 trios when considering a GRR as low as 1.5. Specifically, power ranged from 60–75% (allele or haplotype frequency=0.1) to > 95% (allele or haplotype frequency=0.3). Power was more limited (for all sample sizes) to detect a GRR ?1.3 when the allele or haplotype frequency was less common (0.1); however, power was much higher, even for sample sizes of 720 and 930 trios, to detect a GRR of 1.3 when the allele or haplotype frequency was > 0.1 (50–80%). It is important to note that 48/50 or 96% of SNPs tested for association in this study had MAF > 0.1; a total of 33/50 or 66% of SNPs had MAF ? 0.25. Power is expected to be much higher for the PDT analyses that utilized additional discordant sibpairs. Our power assessment suggests that the dataset was well-powered to detect even modest NOS2A effects.

We also considered an allele or haplotype frequency range of 0.1–0.5. Based on these assumptions, our analyses of NOS2A SNPs and haplotypes in 1,648 trios had > 95% power to detect very modest genotype relative risks (GRRs) of 1.3 and 1.5 for allele or haplotype frequencies as low as 0.3 and 0.1, respectively. Similar results for statistical power were observed for samples sizes of both 720 and 930 trios when considering a GRR as low as 1.5. Specifically, power ranged from 60–75% (allele or haplotype frequency=0.1) to > 95% (allele or haplotype frequency=0.3). Power was more limited (for all sample sizes) to detect a GRR ?1.3 when the allele or haplotype frequency was less common (0.1); however, power was much higher, even for sample sizes of 720 and 930 trios, to detect a GRR of 1.3 when the allele or haplotype frequency was > 0.1 (50–80%). It is important to note that 48/50 or 96% of SNPs tested for association in this study had MAF > 0.1; a total of 33/50 or 66% of SNPs had MAF ? 0.25. Power is expected to be much higher for the PDT analyses that utilized additional discordant sibpairs. Our power assessment suggests that the dataset was well-powered to detect even modest NOS2A effects.  Supplementary Material Supplementary Tables  Results A comprehensive analytical approach ( Figure 1 ) was utilized that includes families of European descent recruited from the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) ( Table 1 ). Direct sequencing of the NOS2A locus (see Methods and Table S1 for PCR conditions and primer sequences) and subsequent genotyping in 203 unrelated family members identified a subset of 15 tagging SNPs within NOS2A ( Figure 2 ) for further genotyping in 1,648 MS families (Analysis 1). Both family-based single SNP and haplotype tests of association across the NOS2A locus revealed no evidence for association based on our pre-designated type 1 error rate (?=0.001) ( Figure 3A and 3B ; Tables S3 and S4 ). To increase coverage of the NOS2A locus, genotype data available from 38 SNPS within or nearby NOS2A in 930 MS trio families were also utilized for this study (Analysis 2). Finally, we combined all available genotype data (Analysis 1 and Analysis 2) resulting in a total of 50 non-overlapping SNPs within or nearby NOS2A for analyses in 720 MS trio families (Analysis 3). The inclusion of MS families in each analysis was performed in order to maximize the use of available NOS2A genotype data for family-based analyses. Haplotype and single-locus tests of association were then performed for all NOS2A region SNPs. Both family-based single SNP and haplotype tests of association across the NOS2A locus and extended chromosome 17q11 region (total 335 kb; average marker density = one SNP/6.9 kb) revealed no evidence for association ( Figures 3A and 3B ; Tables S3 and S4 ). NOS2A SNP genotype tests (Methods) for association in all three MS family groups were also negative (data not shown). When analyses were stratified by carrier status of the MS-associated DRB1*15 allele in cases ( Figure 3 , Tables S3 and S4 ), or when ‘mild’ and ‘severe’ MS clinical outcomes were considered separately ( Table S5 ), differences in NOS2A allele, genotype or haplotype distributions were not observed. The previously associated NOS2A SNP (rs1137933, exon 10 D346D C/T) 20 was not replicated when UK families were considered separately (928 trios; 301 T:316 NT, p=0.54, data not shown). (All SNPs (rs#) with exact map locations, minor allele frequencies, and results from testing Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) are included in Table S1 .

Both family-based single SNP and haplotype tests of association across the NOS2A locus revealed no evidence for association based on our pre-designated type 1 error rate (?=0.001) ( Figure 3A and 3B ; Tables S3 and S4 ). To increase coverage of the NOS2A locus, genotype data available from 38 SNPS within or nearby NOS2A in 930 MS trio families were also utilized for this study (Analysis 2). Finally, we combined all available genotype data (Analysis 1 and Analysis 2) resulting in a total of 50 non-overlapping SNPs within or nearby NOS2A for analyses in 720 MS trio families (Analysis 3). The inclusion of MS families in each analysis was performed in order to maximize the use of available NOS2A genotype data for family-based analyses. Haplotype and single-locus tests of association were then performed for all NOS2A region SNPs. Both family-based single SNP and haplotype tests of association across the NOS2A locus and extended chromosome 17q11 region (total 335 kb; average marker density = one SNP/6.9 kb) revealed no evidence for association ( Figures 3A and 3B ; Tables S3 and S4 ). NOS2A SNP genotype tests (Methods) for association in all three MS family groups were also negative (data not shown). When analyses were stratified by carrier status of the MS-associated DRB1*15 allele in cases ( Figure 3 , Tables S3 and S4 ), or when ‘mild’ and ‘severe’ MS clinical outcomes were considered separately ( Table S5 ), differences in NOS2A allele, genotype or haplotype distributions were not observed. The previously associated NOS2A SNP (rs1137933, exon 10 D346D C/T) 20 was not replicated when UK families were considered separately (928 trios; 301 T:316 NT, p=0.54, data not shown). (All SNPs (rs#) with exact map locations, minor allele frequencies, and results from testing Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) are included in Table S1 .  Discussion MS clusters with the so-called complex genetic diseases, a large group of common disorders characterized by modest disease risk heritability and multifaceted interactions with environmental influences. Previous efforts to screen the genome for linkage using low-density maps of microsatellite markers were only modestly successful 27 – 29 . More recently, a high density SNP panel was used to perform a linkage study of 730 multiple affected MS families 30 . While the results revealed linkage with genome-wide significance in the MHC region on chromosome 6p21, no other regions with significant evidence for linkage were identified. Variation in the MHC, specifically the HLA-DRB1*15 haplotype, is the strongest known genetic factor for MS, and results from multiple studies support this association 31 , 32 . The complex contribution from this region, however, is estimated to account for only a portion of the risk for the disease. Based on these results, it is clear that common (frequency > 5–10%) non-MHC MS susceptibility alleles confer quite modest risk (odd ratios < 2), and are difficult to detect using linkage studies. Association studies, in comparison, have much greater statistical power to detect modest disease risk variants 33 . Based on the proposed effect size for genetic factors in MS, power calculations show that association studies require large sample sizes (eg. 500–1,500 families or cases and equal numbers of controls) 34 . A large number of published association studies for MS, to date, are substantially underpowered; very few MS candidate genes, including NOS2A , have been properly interrogated, and even fewer have been truly excluded. Results from the first genome-wide SNP association study in MS also underscore the need to carefully evaluate potential candidate genes with modest effects 35 . Our investigation has a number of strengths. High density coverage of the extended NOS2A region on chromosome 17q11 was comprehensive and comprised of high quality, informative SNP genotypes. The total number of SNPs, either genotyped in the current study or highly correlated with genotyped SNPs (r2? 0.80, based on available CEU data ( www.hapmap.org ) was 32 (within NOS2A locus boundaries), and numbered, in total, 151 across the extended NOS2A region (data not shown; see Methods). This resulted in an average marker density for the NOS2A gene one SNP per 1.6 kb, and an average marker density for the NOS2A extended region of one SNP per 2.2 kb. In addition, our large family-based design was well-powered and robust to spurious results due to population stratification. We also included analyses of extended NOS2A haplotypes and genotypes, in addition to allelic tests of association to ensure no genetic effects were missed. Haplotype analyses were based on assigned blocks using conventional methods 50 , and further extended our coverage of untyped NOS2A genetic variants in this genomic region. Finally, given the importance of DRB1*15 in MS, we stratified families based on carrier status of this risk allele for analyses of all NOS2A SNPs and haplotypes to look for differences. Previous results suggested NOS2A associations were more prominent in DRB1*15 positive MS cases 20 , 21 and/or families, however the current study does not confirm this finding. We cannot exclude the potential role of other, yet unidentified, genetic or environmental factors interacting with NOS2A to influence risk for MS modulate disease course. NOS2A interactions with exposure to tobacco smoke have been reported for Parkinson’s disease 18 . Whether this gene-environment relationship is important in MS, given the strong evidence for smoking as a MS risk factor 36 , 37 will need to be investigated. The characterization and inclusion of such cofactors in analyses of all candidate genes in MS may help explain discrepancies between individual studies. The next generation of risk factor studies in MS must incorporate both genetic and environmental exposure data and the application of sophisticated analytical strategies to identify modest interactions influencing risk, particularly in the absence of main effects. This is virtually unexplored territory in MS research. Further, although common coding region NOS2A variants were genotyped and/or captured and subsequently excluded as major risk factors for MS in the present study, a few very rare non-synonymous NOS2A variants have been reported (dbSNP; MAF <<0.05 or unknown) but were not interrogated in the current study. Risk for disease due to rare variants, perhaps in particular subsets of MS, therefore, cannot be excluded. A role for genetic factors influencing clinical outcome in MS is also strongly supported by several lines of evidence. Twin studies demonstrate that concordance of disease course is higher in monozygotic twins when compared to dizygotic twins or siblings 38 ; family studies in MS have reported similar results 39 . While several clinical MS phenotypes have been pursued for genetic studies, one strategy is to compare individuals who are discordant for long-term outcomes. Here, we examined MS cases lying at opposite extremes of the distribution of long-term disability (‘mild’ and ‘severe’ disease subgroups) as defined previously 40 , 41 . A resulting loss of statistical power can be expected with a smaller sample size; however, the anticipated increase in clinical homogeneity of these two subgroups is also expected to increase power to detect genetic influences. Our results demonstrate that common variation within NOS2A , alone, does not appear to significantly influence disease severity defined by long-term disability. However, in order to identify genetic or other risk factors that influence disease severity in MS, it needs to be determined whether radiologic relapses on MRI, defined as the presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions, are a better indicator of disease burden compared to a neurologic examination that characterizes specific disease phenotypes including EDSS. It is important, also, to note that candidate gene studies to identify disease course modifiers have not, as a rule, incorporated drug therapy information for MS cases. Treatment options now approved by the Food and Drug Administration for MS specifically target the inflammatory phase and include immunomodulators such as interferon betas and glatiramer acetate, and an immunosuppressant, mitoxantrone 42 , 43 . Confounding remains possible in studies that do not include this information, particularly if MS cases with distinct genotypes respond differentially to particular treatments. In order to fully dissect the role of candidate genes like NOS2A and others as disease course modifiers in MS, large longitudinal studies that also include HLA class II data, gender, and use of therapeutics, and that capture comprehensive phenotypic information as well as serial MRI measurements, will be required. In summary, results presented here from the largest study of NOS2A variation in MS performed, to date, provide strong evidence for exclusion of common variants in NOS2A underlying susceptibility or affecting disease progression defined by very modest or extreme disability. Molecular methods and our knowledge of the complex genetic landscape in MS have improved considerably over the past three years. Our findings contribute to the understanding of NOS2A variation and MS, and underscore the importance of using large sample sizes to detect modest genetic effects.
