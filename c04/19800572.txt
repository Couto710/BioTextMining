Tail wags dog: Primary cilia and tumorigenesis Damage to the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been implicated in many forms of cancer, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin and medulloblastoma (MB). Primary cilia, which protrude from BCC and MB cells, are Hh signal transduction centers. Mutating cilia can increase or reduce rates of tumorigenesis.
