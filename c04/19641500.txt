Mimicking the BH3 domain to kill cancer cells Cancer cells demonstrate deviant behavior that induces apoptotic signaling. In order to survive, cancer cells typically acquire changes enabling evasion of death signals. One way they do this is by increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins. Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins antagonize death signaling by forming heterodimers with pro-death proteins. Heterodimer formation occurs via binding of the pro-apoptotic proteinâ€™s BH3 domain into the hydrophobic cleft of anti-apoptotic proteins. The BH3 mimetics are small molecule antagonists of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 members that function as competitive inhibitors by binding to the hydrophobic cleft. Under certain conditions, antagonism of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins can unleash pro-death molecules in cancer cells. Thus, the BH3 mimetics are a new class of cancer drugs that specifically target a mechanism of cancer cell survival, to selectively kill cancer cells.  Conclusion Huge inroads have been made in delineating the apoptotic pathway over the last two decades, in particular the mechanism by which the BCL-2 family functions through selective protein-protein interactions to control mitochondrial apoptosis. Simultaneously, an understanding of how cancer cells evade death at the molecular level has been achieved with the BCL-2 family playing a starring role in death avoidance. The stage is set for the next generation of therapeutics, the small-molecule inhibitors of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, to be tested and fully exploited clinically, either as single agents or in combination therapy.
