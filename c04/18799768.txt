Efficacy of a brief behavioral intervention to promote condom use among female sex workers in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico Objective To examine efficacy of a brief behavioral intervention to promote condom use among female sex workers (FSWs) in two Mexico-U.S. border cities. Methods 924 FSWs aged ?18 years without known HIV infection living in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez having recent unprotected sex with clients were randomized to a 30 minute behavioral intervention integrating motivational interviewing and principles of behavior change, or a didactic control condition. At baseline and six months, women underwent interviews and testing for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Results Comparing intervention versus control groups, we observed a 40% decline in cumulative STI incidence (p=0.049). Incidence density for the intervention vs. control was 13.8 vs 24.92 per 100 person years (py) for STIs combined (p=0.034), and 0 vs. 2.01 per 100 py for HIV (p<0.001), with concomitant increases in total numbers and percentages of protected sex acts and decreases in total numbers of unprotected sex acts with clients (p<0.05). Conclusions This brief behavioral intervention shows promise in reducing HIV/STI risk behaviors among FSWs in two Mexican-U.S border cities, and may be transferable to other resource-constrained settings.  INTRODUCTION Although commercial sex is quasi-legal in the Zonas Rojas [red light districts] of most Mexican cities, HIV prevalence among female sex workers (FSWs) has been low in most parts of the country. 1 For example, among FSWs in Mexico City and on the Mexico-Guatemala border, HIV prevalence was 0.6% in 1997 2 and 0.6% in 1998, respectively. 3 More recently, reports suggest that HIV prevalence is rising among FSWs on the Mexico-U.S. border. In a sample of 415 FSWs in Tijuana in 1991, HIV prevalence was 0.5%, 4 but in our more recent study of 924 FSWs in both Tijuana (bordering San Diego, CA) and Ciudad Juarez (bordering El Paso, TX), HIV prevalence was 6%. 5 In the same study, prevalence of gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis titers consistent with active infection was 6.4%, 13% and 14.2%. In Mexican culture, sex with female sex workers is tolerated as a display of virility and machismo at all socioeconomic levels. 6 – 8 The sexually permissive environment in Mexican border cities also attracts large numbers of “sex tourists” from the U.S. and other countries who are attracted by newspaper advertisements and websites advertising prostitution. 9 More than two thirds of FSWs in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez report having U.S. clients, and these women have higher prevalence of STIs and higher risk behaviors. 10 FSWs are required by law to obtain a permit if they wish to work without prosecution in Tijuana’s Zona Roja , but more than half work without permits. In Ciudad Juarez, permits are not required. In both cities, FSWs operate out of multiple venues including cantinas, bars, nightclubs, motels and street corners. Seventy percent of these FSWs were born in other Mexican states or Central America, 11 most entering prostitution out of economic necessity. Extreme poverty may compromise their abilities to turn down offers of higher payments for unprotected sex. 12 , 13 In a border region where sex work is tolerated and HIV prevalence is rising, there is a clear need to ensure that condoms are consistently used during commercial sex transactions to prevent outbreaks of HIV or STIs in both countries. We developed a brief behavioral intervention to enhance condom use negotiation among Mexican FSWs. 11 Herein, we report the first results examining its efficacy in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez.  Methods 924 FSWs aged ?18 years without known HIV infection living in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez having recent unprotected sex with clients were randomized to a 30 minute behavioral intervention integrating motivational interviewing and principles of behavior change, or a didactic control condition. At baseline and six months, women underwent interviews and testing for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia.  Results Comparing intervention versus control groups, we observed a 40% decline in cumulative STI incidence (p=0.049). Incidence density for the intervention vs. control was 13.8 vs 24.92 per 100 person years (py) for STIs combined (p=0.034), and 0 vs. 2.01 per 100 py for HIV (p<0.001), with concomitant increases in total numbers and percentages of protected sex acts and decreases in total numbers of unprotected sex acts with clients (p<0.05).  Conclusions This brief behavioral intervention shows promise in reducing HIV/STI risk behaviors among FSWs in two Mexican-U.S border cities, and may be transferable to other resource-constrained settings.  METHODS Settings Tijuana, Mexico’s largest city on its border with the U.S., is home to an estimated 1,410,700 persons. Tijuana and its U.S. neighbor, San Diego, CA together form the world’s largest binational metropolis. Roughly half of Baja California’s population lives in Tijuana, although over half of the city’s inhabitants were born outside the state. 14 In 1999, the per-capita gross regional product in Tijuana was $6,800, less than one-quarter of the comparable figure for San Diego. 15 The border crossing between Tijuana and San Diego is the busiest in the world. In 2005, border officials tallied over 45 million northbound crossings between Tijuana and San Diego County, 16 and 42,000 persons who live in Tijuana head north to San Diego every day. 17 Baja California ranks second among Mexico’s 32 states in terms of cumulative AIDS incidence. 18 Estimates of the number of FSWs in Tijuana vary, but the most widely cited figure is 9,000. 15 Ciudad Juarez, the largest city in the state of Chihuahua, has a population of 1,313,338. 14 In 2000, 36% of Cd. Juarez’s inhabitants had been born outside Chihuahua. In 1999, the per-capita gross regional product of Cd. Juarez was only 41.2% that of El Paso, Texas ($7074 as compared to $17,216). 15 In 2005, officials recorded 29 million border crossings from Cd. Juarez to El Paso. 16 As in Tijuana, the main industry in Cd. Juarez is maquiladora assembly plants. Chihuahua ranks fourteenth in cumulative AIDS incidence among Mexican states. 18 It is estimated that there are at least 4,000 FSWs in Cd. Juarez. 19 Study Population The sample consisted of 924 FSWs who were recruited into a behavioral intervention study to increase condom use in Tijuana and Cd. Juarez between January 2004 and January 2006. 11 Eligibility requirements included an age of at least 18 years, informed consent, and having traded sex for drugs, money, or other material benefit within the previous two months. Participants were also required to have had unprotected vaginal sex with at least one client in the past two months, and they were excluded if they reported they had previously tested HIV-positive. Recruitment occurred by means of outreach workers and municipal and community health clinics. Baseline and follow-up interviews were administered in Spanish by trained female counselors in private clinic rooms or outreach offices. Participants also provided a blood draw and cervical swab and were compensated $30 US at baseline and follow-up visits. Baseline and followup interviews The baseline interview covered a range of topics including sexual risk behaviors, working conditions, financial need, victimization and trauma, use of alcohol and illicit drugs, social support, social influence, life experiences, mood, self-esteem, social cognitive factors, sociodemographic characteristics, and physical and psychiatric health variables. It also addressed such behavioral outcomes as frequency of unprotected sex with clients and spouse/steady partner, number of clients, number and type of other sex partners (non-clients), self-reported number and type of STIs, and alcohol and drug use. The follow-up survey was nearly identical but referred to behaviors taking place over the prior six months. Intervention and Didactic Control Conditions Randomization to either the intervention (“Mujer Segura” [Healthy Woman] counseling session) or the didactic control condition was performed weekly within each city using a fixed, computer generated randomization scheme. 20 Mujer Segura Intervention In developing the intervention materials, we drew extensively on our experience with a pilot study conducted in Tijuana 21 and with other sexual risk reduction interventions among high risk populations in the U.S. 22 , 23 The content of Mujer Segura was tailored to the needs, values, beliefs, and behaviors of our target population and was delivered by specially trained, local health care staff and indigenous promotoras (outreach workers). Delivery of the intervention required about 35 minutes. A detailed description of the protocol has been published elsewhere. 11 In keeping with its basis in social cognitive theory, 24 the intervention aimed to increase participants’ knowledge, self-efficacy, and outcome expectancies regarding safer sex behavior. In addition, motivational interviewing techniques (e.g., key questions, reflective listening, summarization, affirmation, and appropriate use of cultural cues) were used to elicit information on the participant’s current situation and motivations and to increase motivations to practice safer sex. 25 Four main areas were addressed: 1) identification of motivations for practicing safer sex (e.g., protecting one’s own health, avoiding STIs) and unsafe sex (e.g., financial gain); 2) barriers to condom use (e.g., threat of physical violence) and motivations for using condoms (e.g., to feel clean); 3) negotiation of safer sex with clients; and 4) enhancing social support. Emphases were guided in part by our pilot findings; for example, FSWs in the pilot indicated that the most important motivator of behavior change was the desire to protect their health in order to be able to continue supporting their children. 21 As each area was addressed, participants were encouraged to increase self-efficacy by role-playing interactions with clients. Then, in an application of the “decisional balance” approach of Miller and Rollnick, participants were asked to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of practicing or negotiating the practice of safer sex. 25 Once awareness of the problem was achieved and the balance began to shift in favor of positive change, the counselor helped the participant develop a plan of action that best suited her personal situation, and the two then identified barriers to implementation of the plan and possible ways to overcome them. Didactic Control Condition Because of the high risk nature of this population, we chose an active comparision condition which provided information that is critical to HIV/STI prevention. The comparison condition was a face to face, time equivalent didactic presentation of prevention materials extracted from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised guidelines for HIV counseling, testing, and referral 26 and materials from Mexico’s National Center for AIDS Studies (CENSIDA). 27 The focus of the counseling session was upon personal risk assessment, cultural identity assessment, and strategies for reducing personal risk. During the personal risk assessment, the counselor helped the participant identify, understand and acknowledge behaviors and circumstances that put her at risk for contracting HIV/STIs, explored the participant’s previous attempts to reduce personal risk, and provided positive reinforcement for steps already taken. The counselor also helped the participant to set small, achievable risk-reduction goals and offered concrete suggestions. Basic educational information (e.g., HIV/STI transmission modes) was provided if the woman’s level of knowledge was low; however, the primary focus was upon the discussion of transmission risk associated with specific behaviors or activities that were relevant to the participant’s personal risk. Lower risk alternatives were promoted (e.g., oral sex). Motivational techniques, role plays, and discussion of specific techniques for negotiating safer sex were avoided. Laboratory Testing Specimen testing was conducted at either the San Diego County Health Department (for Tijuana STI samples and all HIV confirmatory tests) or the El Paso County Health Department (for Cd. Juarez STI samples). The “Determine”® rapid HIV antibody test was administered to determine the presence of HIV antibodies (Abbott Pharmaceuticals, Boston, MA). All reactive samples were then tested using HIV-1 antibody by EIA and Western Blot. Syphilis serology used the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test (Macro-Vue, Becton Dickenson, Cockeysville, MD, USA). All RPR-positive samples were subjected to confirmatory testing using the Treponema pallidum hemagglutinin assay (TPHA) (Fujirebio, Wilmington, DE, USA). Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis were detected from vaginal swabs collected by trained nurses, using the Aptima® Combo 2 collection device (Genprobe, San Diego, CA), which allows for a direct target-amplified nucleic acid probe test. HIV/STI test results were provided to participants, and those testing positive were referred to municipal health clinics for free medical care. Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards in the U.S. and Mexico. Statistical Analysis Behavioral outcomes focused on the following behaviors with clients: frequency of unprotected sex; protected sex ratio (number of protected sex acts divided by total number of acts); number and type of STIs and incidence of HIV and STIs. FSWs also reported the number of times they engaged in vaginal, oral and anal sex without a condom. We first examined group differences in demographic and baseline characteristics of our sample, using t-tests and Chi-square analyses to compare groups on linear and dichotomous variables, respectively. To examine change in sexual activity outcomes from pre- to post-intervention, for each outcome we conducted a repeated measures Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with intervention condition as our primary independent variable. To control for pre-intervention sexual activity, baseline values of our outcome variable were entered as a covariate. Intervention site (i.e., Tijuana vs. Ciudad Juarez) was also entered as a covariate. We calculated Cohen’s d effect size as an indication of the magnitude of effect, whereby positive values indicated superiority of the intervention. 28 Cohen’s d effect size represents the magnitude of differences between two groups in standard deviation units. An effect size (standard deviation difference) of 0.2 is traditionally considered small, 0.5 is medium, and 0.8 is large. 11 Because both conditions were active interventions, d -values ? 0.2 were interpreted as clinically meaningful, as reported in the literature. 29 , 30 Our second set of analyses examined efficacy of the intervention for reducing incident HIV and other STIs. To take the most conservative approach, Chi-square tests compared only those participants who had negative test results for the respective STI at the baseline assessment. As an indication of effect size, we calculated the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) for each STI outcome, where NNT represents the number of participants in the intervention who would need to be treated before one fewer person contracted the STI than would be the case had all participants received the control condition. 31 Finally, we compared groups in terms of cumulative incidence and incidence density. In both cases, the numerator was the number of women who acquired the STI in question during follow-up; for cumulative incidence, the denominator was the total number of at-risk women, whereas for incidence density the denominator was the total number of person years for at-risk women. For each HIV/STI outcome, Poisson regression was used to determine if group differences were statistically significant.

For each HIV/STI outcome, Poisson regression was used to determine if group differences were statistically significant.  RESULTS A total of 924 eligible FSW were enrolled (474 in Tijuana and 450 in Cd. Juarez), of whom 55 (6%) tested HIV-positive and 869 (94%) tested HIV-negative. The average age was 33.5 years (Interquartile Range [IQR]: 26.5, 40.5), a minority spoke English (19.3%), and the average duration of formal education was low (mean: 6 years; IQR: 4, 8). Most women were married or living in common-law relationships, and 93.7% had children ( Table 1 ). Participants in the control condition were significantly more likely to have syphilis titers consistent with active infection and reported more children than those in the intervention condition, but otherwise did not differ with respect to other characteristics (all other p-values > 0.05). Since the primary outcome was to reduce HIV incidence, the 55 HIV-positive FSWs were excluded from subsequent analysis. Of the remaining 869 women, 709 (81.6%) were assessed at the 6-month post-intervention assessment (intervention: 341; didactic control: 368; refer to Figure 1 ). Participants who did not complete the post-intervention assessment were significantly younger (31.0 vs. 34.0 years; p<0.001), had worked fewer years in the sex trade (4.2 vs. 6.8 years; p< 0.001), and had lived fewer years in their respective study location (13.2 vs. 16.9 years; p=0.001), but did not differ in terms of any other demographic or sexual risk behaviors (all other p>0.05). Individuals in the intervention condition reported significant improvements in their risk behaviors ( Table 2 ). Compared to those in the didactic control condition (N=337), participants in the intervention condition (N=307) demonstrated significant increases in total number of protected sex acts (p<0.05; Cohen’s d=0.16), significant decreases in the total number of unprotected sex acts (p< 0.05; Cohen’s d=0.17), and significant increases in the percentage of sex acts in which a condom was used (p< 0.05; Cohen’s d=0.25). Repeating these analyses with the 55 HIV-infected women included in the sample led to no appreciable differences. A significant group difference was observed for overall STIs ( Table 3 ; p=0.049); however, significant results were not observed for individual STIs. For any STI including active syphilis, the NNT was 20, indicating that 20 women would need to receive the intervention before one reduction in STI would be observed. In terms of cumulative incidence ( Table 3 ), we similarly did not observe significant differences for HIV or specific STIs, likely due to low power; however, a 40% decrease in overall STI incidence was observed in the intervention group relative to the didactic control (i.e., 20% vs. 38%; RR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.36, 1.00). In terms of incidence density ( Table 4 ), HIV incidence was 2.01 per 100 person years (py) in the didactic control group compared to 0 in the intervention group (p=0.0004), and overall STI incidence was also significantly lower in the intervention group (13.80 vs. 24.92 per 100 py; p=0.034).  RESULTS A total of 924 eligible FSW were enrolled (474 in Tijuana and 450 in Cd. Juarez), of whom 55 (6%) tested HIV-positive and 869 (94%) tested HIV-negative.

In terms of cumulative incidence ( Table 3 ), we similarly did not observe significant differences for HIV or specific STIs, likely due to low power; however, a 40% decrease in overall STI incidence was observed in the intervention group relative to the didactic control (i.e., 20% vs. 38%; RR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.36, 1.00). In terms of incidence density ( Table 4 ), HIV incidence was 2.01 per 100 person years (py) in the didactic control group compared to 0 in the intervention group (p=0.0004), and overall STI incidence was also significantly lower in the intervention group (13.80 vs. 24.92 per 100 py; p=0.034).  DISCUSSION This study found that a brief, behavioral intervention integrating motivational interviewing and principles of behavior change among high risk FSWs significantly reduced HIV and overall STI incidence and unprotected sex with male clients in two Mexico-U.S. border cities. Overall cumulative STI incidence decreased 40% in the intervention group relative to the didactic control. In particular, there was not a single incident HIV infection in the intervention group, whereas HIV incidence was 2.01 per 100 py in the control group. It is noteworthy that our intervention demonstrated significant effects since our didactic control condition was itself an educational intervention that was adapted from binational counseling guidelines. A more passive control condition would likely have generated greater effect sizes. Although the effect sizes we observed tended to be relatively modest for individual STIs and behavioral outcomes, they are within the same range as that reported in meta-analyses of behavioral HIV interventions. 32 , 33 In populations where there is considerable sexual mixing and prevalence of ulcerative STIs is high (due to high incidence or prolonged duration of infection), even interventions with modest effect sizes could have an important impact on HIV and STI incidence at the community level. 34 Our findings therefore have important implications for Mexico and other resource-constrained settings. Our study adds to the growing body of literature on interventions to reduce HIV/STIs and associated high risk behaviors among FSWs. In regions where STIs are prevalent, presumptive STI treatment among FSWs has been evaluated as an HIV prevention measure with mixed, and often short-term results. 35 , 36 The “100% condom campaign”—which requires brothels to enforce strict regulations for consistent condom use or risk losing their license—was successful in Thailand 37 and the Dominican Republic. 38 However, marginalized Thai FSWs who started sex work later and worked outside of brothels benefited less. 38 A multi-level intervention to reduce HIV/STI incidence among FSWs showed efficacy in Calcutta 38 but has proven difficult to replicate elsewhere. 38 These experiences suggest that cultural, social and contextual conditions that vary between and even within countries must be taken into account in the development of FSW interventions. An advantage to our approach is that it can be tailored not only to the cultural context but also to each woman’s personal situation, since the woman actively identifies barriers to safer sex in her own life and potential solutions as part of her goal-setting with the counselor. 11 , 21 Previous work supports the notion that behavioral interventions can reduce high risk behavior and STIs among ethnic minorities. For example, in a study by Shain et al., Mexican American and African American women randomized to three four-hour intervention sessions experienced significantly reduced STI incidence and risk behaviors. 39 DiClemente and colleagues reported that African American adolescent girls who received four four-hour group interventions reported consistent use of condoms and had reduced STI incidence. 40 In a meta-analysis, Crepaz and colleagues concluded that successful interventions are informed by ethnographic studies, are theory based, focus on skill-building, and are tailored to the appropriate cultural context. 32 In their meta-analysis, Johnson and colleagues showed that motivational and skill-based interventions were especially efficacious. 33 The present study extends previous findings by demonstrating that a brief, single-session intervention incorporating these elements is efficacious in reducing HIV, STIs and high risk behavior among Mexican FSWs. Interpretation of our findings should bear in mind a number of limitations. Follow-up was relatively short (i.e., six months), and therefore effects may wane over time. However, we recently reported that a similar brief intervention based on the same theoretical principles led to sustained improvements among men who have sex with men 22 and HIV-negative heterosexual men and women 23 over periods of 12 and 18 months, respectively. While our study incorporated randomization and achieved balance across most baseline characteristics, participants randomly assigned to the control condition had a higher prevalence of syphilis titers consistent with active infection. In analyzing these data, we took the most conservative approach by considering women at-risk of incident syphilis only if they were negative for syphilis at baseline. Although our study recruited FSWs from two Mexico-U.S. border cities, our findings may not be generalizable outside of these cities. Since STI incidence remained unacceptably high even in the intervention group, additional efforts are needed, such as interventions aimed at clients and non-paying partners (e.g., spouses/boyfriends). While there are a number of candidate HIV vaccines and vaginal microbicides under development, 11 neither is likely to be available in the near future, and it would be unrealistic to anticipate 100% efficacy in either case. The urgent need continues for effective, culturally appropriate interventions that can be used as stand-alone programs or as adjuncts to existing approaches. Our brief intervention, which can be delivered by trained counselors with little to no formal education in a variety of settings, is an inexpensive approach to HIV/STI risk reduction that may be transferable to other resource-constrained settings.
