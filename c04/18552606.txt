Acupuncture and Osteoarthritis of the Knee A Review of Randomized, Controlled Trials Osteoarthritis of the knee is a major cause of disability among adults. Treatment is focused on symptom management, with nonpharmacologic therapies being the preferred first line of treatment. Acupuncture is considered a potentially useful treatment for osteoarthritis. The objective of this article is to review the English-language articles, indexed in MEDLINE or CINAHL, describing randomized, controlled trials of the effects of needle or electroacupuncture on knee osteoarthritis. Ten trials representing 1456 participants met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. These studies provide evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for pain and physical dysfunction associated with osteoarthritis of the knee.  Methods Approach to literature search A MEDLINE search (1966 to April 2006) was conducted as follows: (1) explode “acupuncture” or explode “acupuncture analgesia” or explode “acupuncture therapy” or explode “acupuncture points” or “acupuncture.mp” (search as key word) (10,214 hits); (2) explode “osteoarthritis”or explode “osteoarthritis, knee” or “osteoarthritis.mp”(search as key word) (30,749 hits); (3) explode “Knee” or explode “knee joint” or “knee.mp” (search as key word) (61,793 hits). Combining these 3 searches together (1, 2, and 3) yielded 68 citations. CINAHL (1982–2005) was also searched as follows: (1) explode “acupuncture” or explode “acupuncture analgesia”or explode “acupuncture anesthesia” or explode “acupuncture points” or “acupuncture.mp” (search as key word) (3158 hits); (2) explode “osteoarthritis” or “osteoarthritis.mp” (search as key word) (2858 hits); (3) explode “Knee” or explode “knee joint” or “knee.mp” (search as key word) (8248 hits). Combining these 3 searches together (1, 2, and 3) resulted in 47 citations. Titles, abstracts, and publication types of the 115 citations were scanned to determine which of these articles were applicable for this review. Bibliographies from retrieved articles were searched for relevant studies that might have been missed by the database searches. Criteria for inclusion and exclusion English-language articles were included if the articles described randomized, controlled trials of the effects of needle or electroacupuncture (EA) on symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee. Articles were excluded if they described case studies, unblinded, nonrandomized, or noncontrolled trials; used types of acupuncture other than needle or EA (such as bee venom acupuncture); studied types of arthritis other than osteoarthritis (such as rheumatoid); studied joints other than the knee; or were unavailable in English. Results from the trials A total of 10 trials representing 1456 participants met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in this review ( Table 1 ). Participants The number of participants in the studies ranged from 24 19 to 570. 20 The mean age reported in 8 of the 10 studies was in the 1960s. 20 – 27 The mean ages for the remaining studies were 58.1 and 85 years, respectively. 19 , 28 All participants in all studies had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knee through radiographic evidence 20 – 28 and/or according to ACR criteria. 19 , 23 , 24 , 27 Groups To be eligible for inclusion in this review, a study had to have a true acupuncture group and a control group. Six of the studies compared true acupuncture to a sham acupuncture control group 20 , 22 , 24 , 26 – 28 ; 3 used a wait-list control, 21 , 25 , 27 2 used an education control, 19 , 20 and 1 used a standard care control. 23 Three studies included additional treatment groups as follows: a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treatment group, 19 TENS group and ice massage group, 28 and diclofenac (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), EA plus diclofenac, and placebo tablet plus placebo EA groups. 24 Types of acupuncture treatment The types of true acupuncture included needling without any electrical stimulation, 21 , 22 , 27 conduction of electricity through all the needles (EA), 19 , 24 , 28 and needle acupuncture supplemented with EA of a subset of the needles. 20 , 23 , 25 , 26 Sham acupuncture included superficial needling of nonacupuncture points, 22 , 27 patch electrodes without needles or current, 24 , 28 tapping of knee points with needle guiding tube (knees were blocked from patients view), plus needle insertion in visible abdominal nonacupoints, 20 and needle in adhesive cylinder, no penetration, no electric current. 26 The same 4 acupuncture points were stimulated in at least half of the studies: ST-35, 19 – 24 , 28 ST-36, 20 , 21 , 23 , 25 , 26 SP-9, and GB-34. 20 , 22 , 23 , 25 , 26 , 28 Seven other points were used in at least 2 of the studies: ST-34, 21 , 28 SP-6, 20 , 23 , 26 LI-4, 21 , 25 , 26 GB-39, 20 , 23 BL-60, 20 , 23 KI-3, 20 , 23 , 26 and Xiyan. 20 , 23 – 25 One study did not dictate that specific points be used for each visit but permitted the acupuncturist to choose from a list of approved acupoints. 27 Half of the studies stimulated at least 8 acupuncture points per session. 20 , 23 , 25 – 27 Each of the other studies treated a different number of acupoints each session: 6, 21 5, 22 4, 28 3, 24 and 2. 19 A treatment period of 4 weeks or less, with the total number of sessions ranging from 6 to 12, was used in 5 of the studies. 19 , 21 , 22 , 24 , 28 The treatment period of the other studies varied from 5 to 26 weeks for as few as 10 to as many as 23 sessions. 20 , 23 , 25 – 27 In half of the studies, the authors reported that the acupuncture treatments were administered by trained professionals, 20 , 22 , 24 , 26 , 27 whereas the remaining 5 studies did not address the qualifications of the person(s) administering the treatment. 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 , 28 In 2 of the studies, 24 , 28 the acupuncturist did not seek the de qi sensation, a feeling of heaviness or numbness that confirms, upon needle placement, that the needle is in the correct site. Design One study was described as double-blinded, 22 and the remaining 9 studies used a single-blind design. 19 – 21 , 23 – 28 Participants were blinded to group assignment in those studies comparing true acupuncture to sham acupuncture. For studies using a wait-list or education control group comparison, participants could not be blinded; but in all cases, the assessors were blinded to group assignment. Outcomes measured in the trials The outcomes of interest in this review are those recommended by the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology and Arthritis Clinical Trials guidelines 29 and the Osteoarthritis Research Society task force on clinical trials 30 as core , or primary, outcomes for osteoarthritis trials: pain, physical function, and patient global assessment. All studies had pain in common as an outcome measure. Some measured pain using a visual analog scale, 21 , 24 – 26 whereas other studies used numeric formats such as a numeric rating scale, 19 pain dolorimetry, 22 a pain intensity scale, 28 or the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale. 20 , 23 , 24 , 27 Six studies measured physical function using the WOMAC function subscale 20 , 22 , 23 , 26 , 27 and/or the Algofunctional Index. 23 , 24 Three of the randomized, controlled trials included a patient global assessment, 20 , 24 , 25 making these the only studies to incorporate the 3 Outcome Measures in Rheumatology and Arthritis Clinical Trials core set clinical measures. Noncore set outcome measures used in the studies included quality-of-life measures, 20 , 26 , 27 physician global assessment, 24 , 25 examination-based measures, such as joint range-of-motion, 19 , 28 and performance-based measures, such as walk times. 19 – 21 , 24 , 28 Findings within the trials Pain was the only outcome reported by all the studies; therefore, it is the focus of this section. In 8 of the 10 studies, the acupuncture group experienced statistically significant pain reduction in comparison with the control group. 20 , 21 , 23 – 28 One of these studies also found that the reduction in pain was significantly greater for the acupuncture group versus the drug treatment (diclofenac) group. 24 One study did not report on the difference between groups over time but instead reported a statistically significant difference in pretreatment versus posttreatment pain in both the EA and TENS groups but not in the control group. 19 Only 1 study found that the between-group difference over time was not statistically significant; however, a statistically significant difference in the pretreatment and posttreatment pain scores of both the true acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups was reported. 22 This study was also the only study that found no statistically significant difference between the groups over time on the physical function outcome, but, as with pain, the prefindings or postfindings were significant. 22 Each of the other 5 studies found a statistically significant improvement in physical function in the acupuncture group versus the control group. 20 , 23 , 24 , 26 , 27 Of the 3 trials that included a patient global assessment, only 1 reported a significantly greater improvement in the acupuncture group than the control group. 20 One study did not state whether or not the difference was significant, 25 and the third reported there was no statistically significant difference between the groups over time. 24  Methods Approach to literature search A MEDLINE search (1966 to April 2006) was conducted as follows: (1) explode “acupuncture” or explode “acupuncture analgesia” or explode “acupuncture therapy” or explode “acupuncture points” or “acupuncture.mp” (search as key word) (10,214 hits); (2) explode “osteoarthritis”or explode “osteoarthritis, knee” or “osteoarthritis.mp”(search as key word) (30,749 hits); (3) explode “Knee” or explode “knee joint” or “knee.mp” (search as key word) (61,793 hits).

Six of the studies compared true acupuncture to a sham acupuncture control group 20 , 22 , 24 , 26 – 28 ; 3 used a wait-list control, 21 , 25 , 27 2 used an education control, 19 , 20 and 1 used a standard care control. 23 Three studies included additional treatment groups as follows: a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treatment group, 19 TENS group and ice massage group, 28 and diclofenac (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), EA plus diclofenac, and placebo tablet plus placebo EA groups. 24 Types of acupuncture treatment The types of true acupuncture included needling without any electrical stimulation, 21 , 22 , 27 conduction of electricity through all the needles (EA), 19 , 24 , 28 and needle acupuncture supplemented with EA of a subset of the needles. 20 , 23 , 25 , 26 Sham acupuncture included superficial needling of nonacupuncture points, 22 , 27 patch electrodes without needles or current, 24 , 28 tapping of knee points with needle guiding tube (knees were blocked from patients view), plus needle insertion in visible abdominal nonacupoints, 20 and needle in adhesive cylinder, no penetration, no electric current. 26 The same 4 acupuncture points were stimulated in at least half of the studies: ST-35, 19 – 24 , 28 ST-36, 20 , 21 , 23 , 25 , 26 SP-9, and GB-34. 20 , 22 , 23 , 25 , 26 , 28 Seven other points were used in at least 2 of the studies: ST-34, 21 , 28 SP-6, 20 , 23 , 26 LI-4, 21 , 25 , 26 GB-39, 20 , 23 BL-60, 20 , 23 KI-3, 20 , 23 , 26 and Xiyan. 20 , 23 – 25 One study did not dictate that specific points be used for each visit but permitted the acupuncturist to choose from a list of approved acupoints. 27 Half of the studies stimulated at least 8 acupuncture points per session. 20 , 23 , 25 – 27 Each of the other studies treated a different number of acupoints each session: 6, 21 5, 22 4, 28 3, 24 and 2. 19 A treatment period of 4 weeks or less, with the total number of sessions ranging from 6 to 12, was used in 5 of the studies. 19 , 21 , 22 , 24 , 28 The treatment period of the other studies varied from 5 to 26 weeks for as few as 10 to as many as 23 sessions. 20 , 23 , 25 – 27 In half of the studies, the authors reported that the acupuncture treatments were administered by trained professionals, 20 , 22 , 24 , 26 , 27 whereas the remaining 5 studies did not address the qualifications of the person(s) administering the treatment. 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 , 28 In 2 of the studies, 24 , 28 the acupuncturist did not seek the de qi sensation, a feeling of heaviness or numbness that confirms, upon needle placement, that the needle is in the correct site. Design One study was described as double-blinded, 22 and the remaining 9 studies used a single-blind design. 19 – 21 , 23 – 28 Participants were blinded to group assignment in those studies comparing true acupuncture to sham acupuncture. For studies using a wait-list or education control group comparison, participants could not be blinded; but in all cases, the assessors were blinded to group assignment. Outcomes measured in the trials The outcomes of interest in this review are those recommended by the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology and Arthritis Clinical Trials guidelines 29 and the Osteoarthritis Research Society task force on clinical trials 30 as core , or primary, outcomes for osteoarthritis trials: pain, physical function, and patient global assessment. All studies had pain in common as an outcome measure. Some measured pain using a visual analog scale, 21 , 24 – 26 whereas other studies used numeric formats such as a numeric rating scale, 19 pain dolorimetry, 22 a pain intensity scale, 28 or the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale. 20 , 23 , 24 , 27 Six studies measured physical function using the WOMAC function subscale 20 , 22 , 23 , 26 , 27 and/or the Algofunctional Index. 23 , 24 Three of the randomized, controlled trials included a patient global assessment, 20 , 24 , 25 making these the only studies to incorporate the 3 Outcome Measures in Rheumatology and Arthritis Clinical Trials core set clinical measures. Noncore set outcome measures used in the studies included quality-of-life measures, 20 , 26 , 27 physician global assessment, 24 , 25 examination-based measures, such as joint range-of-motion, 19 , 28 and performance-based measures, such as walk times. 19 – 21 , 24 , 28 Findings within the trials Pain was the only outcome reported by all the studies; therefore, it is the focus of this section.

There is not sufficient evidence to indicate whether or not acupuncture affects other factors associated with knee arthritis. All 10 of the studies measured pain, and 6 of these also measured physical function. Only 1 of the 6 studies determined that the difference between treatment group and control group was not statistically significant for either of these 2 outcomes. The negative study findings in this 1 study should be considered with caution because the researchers used a flawed sham treatment. The sham involved needling “nonacupoints.” The supposed nonacupoints were in close proximity to real acupoints and the needling elicited the de qi sensation in 11 of the 20 controls, suggesting that the controls may have been active treatment cases. In fact, when the researchers reanalyzed the data, using de qi rather than treatment as the group factor, significant group × time interactions were found for pain. The other 9 studies concluded that acupuncture was effective. One of these studies 19 reported positive findings for the treatment groups but did not compare the treatment to the control group; the remaining studies found that the acupuncture group experienced significantly greater improvements in pain and physical function than the control group. 20 , 21 , 23 ? 28 Although all of these trials are supportive of the effectiveness of acupuncture, an argument could be made that the results of the 4 studies that did not include a sham acupuncture group 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 offer weak evidence because the results of these 4 studies may be due to a placebo effect. The strongest evidence comes from the sham-controlled trials, 20 , 24 , 26 , 27 as this design controls for the placebo effect (one study 28 that used a placebo group is not included here because it was a TENS placebo and not a sham acupuncture group). The sham-controlled studies had other strengths as well. These 4 studies were among the largest, having 97, 26 193, 24 294, 27 and 570 20 participants. These studies used qualified acupuncturists and gave the most treatments (12 sessions 24 , 26 , 27 or 23 sessions 20 ). On the basis of the findings of the studies reviewed, acupuncture should be considered a viable adjunct or alternative treatment of knee pain and dysfunction associated with osteoarthritis of the knee for the thousands of individuals across the country who are suffering from symptoms of this chronic disease.
