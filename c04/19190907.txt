Synthesis of sialyl Lewis a (sLe a, CA19-9) and construction of an immunogenic sLe a vaccine Sialyl Lewisa (sLea), also termed CA19-9 antigen, is recognized by murine mAb19-9 and is expressed on the cancer cell surface as a glycolipid and as an O-linked glycoprotein. It is highly expressed in a variety of gastrointestinal epithelial malignancies including colon cancer and pancreatic cancer, and in breast cancer and small cell lung cancer, but has a limited expression on normal tissues. sLea is known to be the ligand for endothelial cell selectins suggesting a role for sLea in cancer metastases and adhesion. For these reasons, sLea may be a good target for antibody mediated immunotherapy including monoclonal antibodies and tumor vaccines. However, sLea is structurally similar to sLex and other blood group related carbohydrates which are widely expressed on polymorphonucleocytes and other circulating cells, raising concern that immunization against sLea will induce antibodies reactive with these more widely expressed autoantigens. We have shown previously both in mice and in patients that conjugation of a variety of carbohydrate cancer antigen to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and administration of this conjugate mixed with saponin adjuvants QS-21 or GPI-0100 are the most effective methods for induction of antibodies against these cancer antigens. We describe here for the first time the total synthesis of pentenyl glycoside of sLea hexasaccharide and its conjugation to KLH to construct a sLea-KLH conjugate. Groups of five mice were vaccinated subcutaneously four times over 6 weeks. Sera were tested against sLea-HSA by ELISA and against sLea positive human cell lines adenocarcinoma SW626 and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) DMS79 by FACS. As expected, mice immunized with unconjugated sLea plus GPI-0100 or unconjugated sLea mixed with KLH plus GPI-0100 failed to produce antibodies against sLea. However, mice immunized with sLea-KLH conjugate without GPI-0100 produced low levels of antibodies and mice immunized with sLea-KLH plus GPI-0100 produced significantly higher titer IgG and IgM antibodies against sLea by ELISA. These antibodies were highly reactive by FACS and mediated potent complement mediated cytotoxicity against sLea positive SW626 and DMS79 cells. They showed no detectable cross reactivity against a series of other blood group-related antigens, including Ley, Lex, and sLex by dot blot immune staining. This vaccine is ready for testing as an active immunotherapy for treating sLea positive cancer in clinical settings.  Introduction Sialyl Lewisa (sLea) [NeuAc?2?3Gal ? 1?4(Fuc?1?3) GlcNAc ? 1?3Gal ? -] [ 1 ] is recognized by murine monoclonal antibody 19-9 [ 2 ]. The sLea antigen (also termed CA19-9) is expressed as a glycolipid with the ceramide moiety imbedded in cell membrane lipid bilayers or as a glycoprotein, most commonly O-linked on mucins. The sLea expression on normal tissues is restricted to ductal epithelial in the lumen of a variety of epithelial tissues, sites largely inaccessible to antibodies and antibody mediated effector mechanisms. It is, however, widely expressed on a variety of gastrointestinal epithelial malignancies [ 3 ] including colon cancer [ 4 ] and pancreatic cancer [ 5 ], but also on breast cancer [ 6 ] and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), [ 3 ] indicating a higher frequency of nodal involvement and a worse prognosis [ 4 , 6 , 7 ] and when sLea is detected in the serum, it serves as a marker for these malignancies. sLea is also known as a ligand for leukocyte endothelial adhesion molecules such as endothelial E-selectin [ 8 - 10 ]. The fact that sLea is expressed as a carbohydrate epitope on glycolipids or glycoproteins make it an unlikely target for classical cell mediated immunity based therapeutic interventions. However, the high expression of sLea at the cell surface on several epithelial malignancies, its limited expression on normal tissues that are accessible to the immune system and its possible role in the metastatic process makes sLea a good target for antibody mediated immunotherapy including monoclonal antibodies and antibody inducing tumor vaccines. The preparation of vaccines against defined autoantigens such as sLea is difficult because induction of active immunity against them involves overcoming some degree of immune tolerance. In our experience the most effective method for inducing antibodies against defined autoantigens such as sLea has been conjugation of the antigen to an immunogenic protein carrier molecule such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) [ 11 ] and administration of the resulting conjugate combined with a saponin immune adjuvant such as the purified saponin fraction QS-21 [ 12 ] or the semi-synthetic saponin mixture GPI-0100 [ 13 ]. KLH is a large highly immunogenic protein purified from the blood of the keyhole limpet. GPI-0100 has been chemically modified to decrease toxicity and improve stability [ 14 ]. We have shown previously in mice and in patients that this combination approach is the most effective method for induction of antibodies against a variety of gangliosides, neutral glycolipids and other carbohydrate and peptide antigens (reviewed in [ 15 ]). There are no previous reports describing vaccines composed of sLea, largely because of the lack of natural sources of easily extractable sLea and the difficulties encountered in chemically synthesizing such a complex molecule. We describe here for the first time the total chemical synthesis of sLea based on the one pot synthesis technology (OPopS) [ 16 ], and its conjugation to KLH to construct sLea-KLH. We report herein that the sLea-KLH conjugate plus GPI-0100 vaccine induces high titer IgM and IgG Abs which are highly specific for sLea and react strongly with sLea positive cancer cells.  Materials and methods Antigens and reagents Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (St Louis, MO). Human serum albumin (HSA), sodium cyanoborohydride, and human serum compliment were also obtained from Sigma Chemical Company. 4-(4- N -Maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxyl hydrazide (MMCCH) was purchased from Toronto Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). Monoclonal antibody 121SLE recognizing sLea was purchased from GeneTex, Inc. (San Antonio, TX). Goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM conjugated with alkaline phosphatase and goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM fluorescence-isothiocyanate (FITC) were obtained from Southern Biotechnology Associated (Birmingham, AL). Adjuvant GPI-0100, a semi-synthetic mix of saponin fractions was obtained from Dante Marciani, Galenica Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Birmingham, AL), now known as Hawaii BioTechnology Inc. (Honolulu, Hawaii). SLe-PAA, sLex-PAA, Lex-PAA and Ley-PAA were purchased from Glycotech Corp., Gaithersburg, MD. Globo H-Ceramide, Ley-Ceramide STn(c)-HSA, Tn(c)-HSA and Poly SA-HSA were prepared by our group as described in [ 15 ]. Preparation of sLe<sup>a</sup> and sLe<sup>a</sup>-KLH conjugate The pentenyl glycoside of sLea hexasaccharide was synthesized by Optimer Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (San Diego, CA) using their glycosylation (OPopS) technology [ 16 ] starting from suitably protected mono, di and trisaccharide intermediates as described in Fig. 1 . The product was characterized after each step using NMR spectroscopy in combination with mass spectroscopy. The 1H-NMR spectrum of the final sLea pentenyl glycoside in deuterated water was fully consistent with the sLea structure. The pentenyl group was used for conjugation to KLH essentially as described in Fig. 2 [ 17 ]. The sLea-KLH conjugation procedure was initiated by ozonolytic cleavage of the pentenyl double bond and the resulting aldehyde was reacted with the hydrazine group of the MMCCH in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride to give the sLea-MMCCH. KLH was treated with 2-iminothiolane to introduce thiol groups through the lysine ? -amino groups of the KLH to afford the thiolated KLH. Finally, the sLea-MMCCH and the thiolated KLH were linked in a buffered solution to furnish the sLea-KLH conjugate. The sLea concentration and sLea/KLH epitope ratio of the sLea conjugate were determined using resorcinol by measuring sialic acid content of sLea and KLH by a dye binding method (BioRad, Dye reagent) to be 874. The sLea-HSA conjugate (a target for ELISA) was prepared by reductive amination method similar to the method described for the preparation of STn-KLH conjugate [ 17 ]. Free sLea (unconjugated sLea), sLea-KLH conjugate and GPI-0100 were vialed separately. Mice were immunized with 5 ?g of unconjugated sLea plus 100 ?g GPI-0100, 5 ?g of unconjugated sLea plus 20 ?g KLH and 100 ?g GPI-0100, KLH plus 100 ?g GPI-0100, and 5 ?g of sLea-KLH conjugate plus or minus GPI-0100, subcutaneously in 0.1 ml. Animals and immunization Six week old female C57BL6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Groups of five mice were immunized subcutaneously three times at 1-week intervals with different preparations mixed with 100 ?g of GPI-0100 as indicated in Table 1 . Mice were bled 7 days after the third immunization. A booster vaccination was administered 4 weeks after the third vaccination and mice were bled 7 days later. Mice were weighed at 24, 48, and 72 h after each vaccination. ELISA Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed as previously described [ 18 ]. sLea titers were measured by coating ELISA plates with 0.1 ?g sLea-HSA per well. Serially diluted antisera or monoclonal antibody 19.9 were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Goat anti-mouse IgM or IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase were used as secondary antibodies. The antibody titer was defined as the highest serum dilution showing an absorbance of 0.1 or greater over that of normal mouse (prevaccination) sera. Flow cytometry Cells from the ovarian cancer cell line SW626 and SCLC cell line DMS79 served as sLea positive targets and cells from the sLea negative melanoma cell line SK-MEL-28 served as negative control targets. Cells were incubated on ice with 20 ?l of 1/20 diluted pre vaccination sera, post vaccination sera or murine mAb 121SLE (5 ?g/ml) for 30 min [ 19 ]. After washing, 20 ?l of 1/15 goat anti-mouse IgM or IgG labeled with fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC) was added, mixed and incubated for 30 min on ice. After washing, the positive population and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton and Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Pre and post vaccination sera were analyzed together and the pretreatment percent positive cells gaited at 10%. Results were considered positive when percent positive cells were threefold the pretreatment serum value and the MFI was 150% of the protectant serum MFI. Complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) Complement dependent cytotoxicity was assayed at a serum dilution of 1:4 with SW626 cells and human complement using a chromium release assay as described previously [ 20 ]. All assays were performed in triplicate. Controls included cells incubated only with culture median or complement. Spontaneous release was the chromium release by target cells incubated with complement alone and maximum release was the amount released by target cells after 2 h incubation in the presence of complement and 10% Triton X-100. The percent cytotoxicity was calculated according to the formula Specific release ( % ) = experimental release ? spontaneous release maximum release ? spontaneous release × 100 . Dot blot immune stain Dot blot immune staining of gangliosides and other structurally related antigens (listed in Table 2 ) were spotted on nitrocellulose strips. The unreacted sites were blocked with 3% HSA in PBS contain 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h. Blocked strips were incubated with mouse sera diluted in 3%HSA–PBS at 1:150 dilution overnight at 4°C with gentle stir. The strips were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase conjugate at 1:200 dilution for 2 h at room temperature. Then the strips were washed with PBS–0.05% Tween 20 and developed with developer solution contain 4-chloro-1-naphthol and hydrogen peroxide solution.

Results Toxicity testing There was no evidence of increased weight loss or other toxicity over the 7 weeks of followup in mice receiving the sLea-KLH conjugate plus 100 ?g GPI-0100 compared to mice receiving GPI-0100 plus KLH or the other negative controls (data not shown). As in most groups of immunized mice, regardless of the antigen, there was 3–4% weight loss over the initial 2 days after the initial vaccination, but this was followed by a rapid rebound and then normal weight gain there-after. One mouse in group 4 (mouse 4.5) was small to begin with, lost weight progressively and died before the forth vaccination. This mouse had malocclusion, a genetic defect. No evidence of toxicity has been seen in 15 other mice immunized more recently with this sLea-KLH plus saponin adjuvant vaccine. The failure to thrive of mouse 4.5 was not attributed to the vaccinations. ELISA assays The peak ELISA titers after four vaccinations are demonstrated in Table 1 . No evidence of antibody induction was seen after immunization with sLea plus GPI-0100, KLH plus GPI-0100 or unconjugated sLea plus KLH plus GPI-0100. The sLea-KLH resulted in moderate elevations in ELISA reactivity which was significantly augmented when mixed with GPI-0100. Median antibody titers of 1/51,200 for IgG reactivity and 1/1,280 for IgM reactivity are higher than we have seen in previous studies with other carbohydrate antigens. Also unusual is that IgG antibody titers were significantly more elevated than the IgM antibody titers. This has been a consistent finding with the sLea-KLH conjugate vaccine in three separate experiments. Cell surface reactivity The results of flow cytometry testing on the SW626 ovarian cancer cell line for each of the five groups are summarized in Table 1 and results of the mice immunized with sLea-KLH plus GPI-0100 are demonstrated in Fig 3 . The fifth mouse expired prior to the final (larger) bleed. Striking increases in IgM and IgG reactivity against SW626 were seen for all mice. Comparable cell surface reactivity was seen against a second sLea positive cell line (SCLC cell line DMS79). Median peak IgG MFIs for groups 1–5 against DMS79 were 4, 3, 3, 125 and 22, respectively (data not shown). No increase in reactivity against melanoma cell line SK-MEL-28 (which is sLea negative) was seen with the same sera. Cell surface reactivity against SW626 was also demonstrated by complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assays using human complement and sera from the four mice in group 4 receiving four vaccinations with sLea-KLH plus GPI-0100 vaccines as demonstrated in Fig. 4 . Once again no reactivity was detected prior to immunization and striking CDC reactivity was seen against SW626 after vaccination. Specificity analysis Specificity of the serologic reactivity induced by the sLea-KLH plus GPI-0100 vaccine was confirmed by standard dot blot assays. As demonstrated in Fig. 5 , strong reactivity was detected against conjugates containing sLea but not those containing sLex, Lex (from two different sources), Ley, globo H, sTn, sTn clusters or trimers (c), Tn (c), GD3 ganglioside or polysialic acid. Specificity restricted to sLea was seen in all mice vaccinated with sLea-KLH plus GPI-0100. Positive control mAbs 121SLE against sLea and VK9 against globo H were appropriately positive Fig. 5 .

Discussion Previous studies have indicated the need for conjugation of purified carbohydrate or glycolipid antigens to a highly immunogenic carrier protein such as KLH plus the use of a potent adjuvant such as GPI-0100 for optimal antibody responses. We demonstrate this requirement here again. Vaccination with unconjugated sLea alone or with GPI-0100 or with GPI-0100 plus KLH resulted in no detectable antibody. Immunization with the sLea-KLH conjugate in the absence of GPI-0100 resulted in low or moderate titers of antibody which were significantly increased by the use of GPI-0100. The IgM and IgG antibodies induced against sLea were significantly high, higher than we have seen previously with comparable KLH conjugate vaccines against other carbohydrate and glycolipid antigens. Despite the high levels of IgM and IgG antibodies induced against sLea and the known expression of sLea on a variety of normal murine tissues there was no obvious evidence of toxicity. There was minimal weight loss associated with the immunizations and the mice continued gaining weight over the following weeks suggesting that both the vaccine and the resulting high antibody titers against sLea were well tolerated. This lack of toxicity in the face of high titer antibody against a cell surface antigen expressed on a variety of tissues is consistent with results we have obtained previously. Antigens, though widely expressed, if expressed primarily or exclusively at the luminal borders of tissue, as is the case for sLea, have not been associated with toxicity after the administration of either antibody inducing vaccines or monoclonal antibodies (reviewed [ 15 ]). There was a concern prior to initiating these experiments that antibodies induced by this sLea-KLH vaccine would cross react with a variety of other blood type-related antigens, including Lex, sLex, sLey that are more widely expressed on normal tissues. It turned out that this was not the case. No antibodies induced by the sLea-KLH were detected against any of these antigens, other blood group related antigens including globo H, sTn and Tn, or GD3 or polysialic acid in dot blot assays. sLex and sLea have remarkably similar structures, differing from each other only in the location of the fucose and galactose linkages as indicated in Table 2 . Lex, Ley, GD3 and globo H also have structural similarities to sLea but none were recognized by these high titer antibodies against sLea. Antibodies have been shown to mediate therapeutic efficacy against tumors by antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), by complement mediated cytotoxicity (CDC), or by other complement mediated mechanisms. ADCC requires IgG antibodies of the proper subclass, IgG 2 and 3 in mice and 1 and 3 in humans. These are the IgG subclasses that our KLH conjugate plus saponin adjuvant vaccines have induced in mice and patients in the past and that were induced in mice here with this sLea vaccine. Complement lysis of tumor cells requires antibodies that react with cell surface antigens which are in close proximity to the cell surface. We have demonstrated previously that monoclonal antibodies or vaccine induced antibodies in mice or patients that react with a number of cell surface carbohydrate antigens such as GM2, GD2, GD3, fucosyl GM1, Ley or globo H, or cell surface globular proteins such as EPCAM (KSA), consistently induce complement mediated lysis. We have also demonstrated that antibodies of comparable titer, class and subclass reactive with cell surface mucin molecules such as MUC1, sTn, Tn and TF are unable to induce complement lysis, presumable as a consequence of the distance from the cell surface that complement is being activated [ 20 ]. sLea is expressed at the cell surface both as a glycolipid and as a glycoprotein primarily O-linked to mucin molecules. We demonstrate here significant complement lysis of the human ovarian cancer cell line SW626 with the sLea-KLH vaccine induced immune sera in the presence of human complement. This suggests that not all of the sLea on the surface of SW-626 is expressed on mucins. While protection or therapeutic tumor challenge experiments were not in the scope of the work described here, the target, sLea, and the antibodies induced are shown to be perfect for all of the antibody induced mechanisms known to have therapeutic impact. We demonstrate here that this sLea-KLH plus saponin adjuvant vaccine induces high titers of antibodies that are specific for sLea, react with sLea expressing human cancer cells and mediate complement lysis in the presence of human complement. sLea is known to be abundantly expressed at the cell surface of cancers of GI origin and the majority of human SCLC and breast cancers. sLea expression on normal tissues, however, is restricted to the ductal epithelial tissues where it is expressed in a highly polar distribution primarily at the luminal borders, sites largely inaccessible to antibody mediated attack. These findings make sLea an appealing target for vaccination and suggest that this sLea-KLH conjugate vaccine is ready for testing in the clinic.  Discussion Previous studies have indicated the need for conjugation of purified carbohydrate or glycolipid antigens to a highly immunogenic carrier protein such as KLH plus the use of a potent adjuvant such as GPI-0100 for optimal antibody responses. We demonstrate this requirement here again. Vaccination with unconjugated sLea alone or with GPI-0100 or with GPI-0100 plus KLH resulted in no detectable antibody. Immunization with the sLea-KLH conjugate in the absence of GPI-0100 resulted in low or moderate titers of antibody which were significantly increased by the use of GPI-0100. The IgM and IgG antibodies induced against sLea were significantly high, higher than we have seen previously with comparable KLH conjugate vaccines against other carbohydrate and glycolipid antigens.
