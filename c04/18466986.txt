Increased locomotor activity in mice lacking the low-density lipoprotein receptor While the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is best known for its role in regulating serum cholesterol, LDLR is expressed in brain, suggesting that it may play a role in CNS function as well. Here, using mice with a null mutation in LDLR (LDLR-/-), we investigated whether the absence of LDLR affects a series of behavioral functions. We also utilized the fact that plasma cholesterol levels can be regulated in LDLR-/- mice by manipulating dietary cholesterol to investigate whether elevated plasma cholesterol might independently affect behavioral performance. LDLR-/- mice showed no major deficits in general sensory or motor function. However, LDLR-/- mice exhibited increased locomotor activity in an open field test without evidence of altered anxiety in either an open field or a light/dark emergence test. By contrast, modulating dietary cholesterol produced only isolated effects. While both C57BL/6J and LDLR-/- mice fed a high cholesterol diet showed increased anxiety in a light/dark task, and LDLR-/- mice fed a high cholesterol diet exhibited longer target latencies in the probe trial of the Morris water maze, no other findings supported a general effect of cholesterol on anxiety or spatial memory. Collectively these studies suggest that while LDLR-/- mice exhibit no major developmental defects, LDLR nevertheless plays a significant role in modulating locomotor behavior in the adult.  3. Results 3.1. Experimental design for manipulation of plasma cholesterol in LDLR-/- mice C57BL/6J mice fed a high cholesterol diet develop at most mild elevations in plasma cholesterol. LDLR -/- mice fed a standard low cholesterol rodent chow diet (?4-6% fat, 0.04% or less cholesterol) also develop only moderately increased plasma cholesterol levels and a slightly increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis [ 16 , 17 , 26 ]. However by increasing dietary cholesterol to 0.15% or greater [ 31 ], plasma cholesterol in LDLR-/- mice increases to over 1000 mg/dl, and within 16 weeks of dietary modification the animals develop extensive atherosclerotic lesions [ 2 , 20 ]. To test the effects of both the LDLR as well as elevated plasma cholesterol on behavioral function in LDLR-/- mice we fed C57BL/6J wild type mice and LDLR-/- mice either low (standard lab chow) or high cholesterol (0.15%) diets for 16 weeks at which time behavioral testing was begun. Testing was completed over an approximately 8-week time frame during which the mice were continued on standard lab chow or high cholesterol diets. Plasma cholesterol levels at the completion of behavioral testing are shown in Fig. 1 . Plasma cholesterol in C57BL/6J mice fed a standard lab chow diet (C57BL-L) was between 105-110 mg/dl and did not significantly differ in C57BL/6J mice receiving the high cholesterol diet (C57BL-H). By contrast, plasma cholesterol was over 500 mg/dl in LDLR-/- mice fed the low cholesterol diet (LDLR-L) and was over 1300 mg/dl in LDLR-/- mice on the high cholesterol diet (LDLR-H). A two-way ANOVA revealed the expected effects of both diet (F 1, 44 = 308.4, p < 0.0001) and genotype (F 1, 44 = 69.93, p < 0.0001) and a significant interaction of diet and genotype (F 1, 44 = 66.56, p < 0.0001) with plasma cholesterol increased in both LDLR groups compared to the respective C57BL/6J groups and in the high vs. low cholesterol fed LDLR groups (p < 0.001, Bonferroni post-tests). 3.2. General observations, spontaneous activity, and elicited behavior All animals were first evaluated for general health, certain stereotyped reflexes, motor coordination, and strength. The complete battery of tests administered is listed in Table 1 . LDLR-L mice consistently weighed ?6-7% less compared to C57BL/6J mice or LDLR-/- fed the high cholesterol diet ( Fig. 2A ) with two way ANOVAs showing the effect to be an interaction of diet and genotype (F values 2.5 to 6.9 and p values 0.01-0.11 for interaction; F values 0.018 to 1.864 and p values 0.17 to 0.89 for diet; F values 0.5 to 3.3 and p values 0.07 to 0.45 for genotype). Body length was unchanged ( Fig. 2B ). There were otherwise no abnormalities in any of the other general observations or tests of spontaneous behaviors listed in Table 1 . Among the tests of elicited behaviors, LDLR-L mice grasped better than all other groups in the hanging bar test ( Fig. 2C ), a test of neuromuscular strength with the effect resulting from an interaction of diet and genotype (F 1, 44 = 3.425, p = 0.07 for diet; F 1, 44 = 3.425; p = 0.07 for genotype; F 1, 44 = 7.329, p = 0.009 for interaction; p < 0.01 Bonferroni post-tests). The LDLR-L mice were however not significantly different from the other groups in total hang time ( Fig. 2D ). In the test of negative/positive geotaxis ( Fig. 2E ), C57BL-H, LDLR-L and LDLR-H took ? 2 seconds longer to right themselves than the C57BL-L controls, an effect of both diet and genotype (F 1, 44 = 7.512, p = 0.008 for diet; F 1, 44 = 5.480, p =0.02 for genotype; F 1, 44 = 2.448, p = 0.12 for interaction; p < 0.01 Bonferroni post-tests). All groups performed equally well on a rotarod (data not shown) and there were no differences between the groups in tail flick latency (data not shown). Thus in general, LDLR-/- mice exhibited no major deficits in sensory or motor function and there were no substantial effects of the high cholesterol diet. 3.3. Locomotor activity and open field As a measure of general locomotor activity as well as anxiety, mice were examined in an open field chamber ( Fig. 3 ). While there were no differences among the groups in the amount of time spent in the center vs. the periphery of the field on either day of testing, the LDLR groups traveled a greater distance (F 1, 36 = 4.285, p = 0.04 for genotype, day 1; F 1, 44 = 3.629, p = 0.06 for genotype, day 2) and spent more time in motion in the open field (F 1, 36 = 3.818, p = 0.05 for genotype, day 1; F 1, 44 = 5.271, p = 0.02 for genotype, day 2) than the C57BL/6J groups without any significant effect of diet or interaction effect. Consistent with the effect being due to an increased time spent in motion, the velocity of movement did not differ between groups. There were also no differences between the groups on either day in clockwise or counter clockwise revolutions, total revolutions, the ratio of clockwise to total revolutions, or rears (data not shown). All groups tended to show a test-retest habituation effect spending less time in motion on day 2 (paired t-tests, p = 0.02 for C57BL-L and C57BL-H; p = 0.07 for LDLR-L and p = 0.03 for LDLR-H) and traveling less distance (paired t-tests, p = 0.12 for C57BL-L; p = 0.006 for C57BL-H; p = 0.08 for LDLR-L and p = 0.04 for LDLR-H). However, in comparing the changes between day 1 and day 2, whether computing absolute differences or percent change between day 1 and day 2, there were no significant differences among the groups or any effect of diet or genotype, suggesting that neither absence of the LDLR nor the high cholesterol diet was influencing the habituation effect. Any effects of altered anxiety would be expected to be most prominent in the initial minutes of testing. Since these effects might be lost in the 20-minute composite results as an additional measure of performance in the open field, we also analyzed center time and distance moved during each the first 10 minutes of open field testing during day 1. Center time for all groups progressively increased until about six minutes ( Fig. 4A ). We therefore analyzed center time and distance moved in three-minute intervals for the first 9 minutes ( Figs. 4B-G ). In the first three-minute interval (i.e. minutes 1-3), all groups moved similar distances. However, the LDLR groups traveled between 45 and 50% more than the C57BL groups in the second (F 1, 36 = 10.89, p = 0.002 for genotype) and third-three minute intervals (F 1, 36 = 9.759, p = 0.003 for genotype), without any significant effect of diet or interaction effect. By contrast, while center time approximately doubled in all groups when comparing the third to the first three-minute interval (p < 0.008, paired t-test for each group), there were no differences between the groups. Thus, the increased distance traveled by the LDLR -/- groups is more parsimoniously explained as a hyperactivity response as opposed to altered anxiety. An analysis of the distances moved on a minute-by-minute basis also showed a progressive decrease in the rate of movement that slowed in its rate of change for all groups after 5 minutes, and stopped increasing after 7 minutes (data not shown). In comparing the slopes over the 2-5 minute interval, slopes for the LDLR mice were significantly less negative (F 1, 36 = 4.6, p = 0.03 for genotype), consistent with hyperactivity in the LDLR mice. 3.4. Light/dark emergence Light/dark exploration is an approach/avoidance test which explores the conflict between the tendency of mice to avoid a brightly lit open field vs. the tendency to explore a novel environment [ 6 ]. Due to its sensitivity to anxiolytic drugs, it is considered a measure of anxiety in mice [ 7 ]. Subjects were allowed to explore the dark chamber before access to the light was provided; the latency to emerge into and explore the light side was measured. As judged by the latency to first crossing the light edge, there were no significant differences between the groups ( Fig. 5 ). However, the low cholesterol fed groups (C57BL-L and LDLR-L) spent more time at the light edge (light edge duration, F 1, 44 = 4.401, p = 0.04 for diet), and entered the center of the lighted field (light center latency, F 1, 44 = 4.873, p = 0.03 for diet) more quickly than groups fed the high cholesterol diet (C57BL-H and LDLR-H), without any significant effects of genotype or interaction effects. The low cholesterol groups also showed a trend towards more light edge entries (p = 0.06), light center entries (p = 0.06) and a longer total light duration (p = 0.06), results that two way ANOVAs revealed were associated with diet and not genotype ( Fig. 5 ). By contrast, LDLR mice had longer dark edge distances (F 1, 44 = 5.214, p = 0.02 for genotype), as well as a greater total distance moved in the dark (F 1, 44 = 6.756, p = 0.01 for genotype), without any significant effects of diet or interaction effects. Thus no evidence was found for LDLR itself affecting anxiety levels although the increased distance moved in the dark by LDLR-/- mice may be another manifestation of the increased locomotor activity seen in LDLR-/- mice in the open field. These studies might also be seen as suggesting that a high cholesterol diet increases anxiety in both wild type as well as LDLR-/- mice. However, any effect appears task specific since diet had no effect on anxiety in the open field. In addition, after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing of the number of specific measurements, none of the differences in the light/dark emergence task would be considered significant and thus must be interpreted with caution. 3.5 Elevated zero maze As an additional test for altered anxiety in LDLR-/- mice, we also examined all groups in an elevated zero maze. No significant differences were found between the groups in open and closed arc times, or total open arm entries ( Fig. 6 ). There was also no difference in the latency to enter an open arc or to cross an open arc between two closed arcs (data not shown). Thus as in the light/dark emergence task, no evidence was found for LDLR-/- mice having altered levels of anxiety. High cholesterol fed animals spent more time in motion on day 2 (F1, 36 = 5.013, p = 0.03 for diet, data not shown). However, all groups spent similar times in motion on day 1 and there were no differences between the groups on day in total distance moved (data not shown), suggesting no general effect of diet on tendency to move in this task. 3.6. Morris water maze Hypercholesterolemia has been suggested to be an independent risk factor for developing the memory impairments associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [ 3 , 5 , 28 ]. In addition, a prior study reported that LDLR-/- mice exhibited impaired spatial memory in the Morris water maze [ 23 ]. We therefore assessed the effects of the LDLR mutation as well as elevated dietary cholesterol on spatial memory using the Morris water maze. Latencies during the eight-day training period are shown in Fig. 6A . Slopes for days 3-8 were significantly different from zero at an 0.095 or better significance level for each group (p < 0.0005 for C57BL-L; p = 0.05 for C57BL-H and LDLR-L; p = 0.095 for LDLR-H, two-sided tests); the four groups did not differ significantly in their mean slopes suggesting that all groups learned the task. On the probe trial, LDLR-H mice took longer to reach the target site ( Fig. 6B ). This effect was found to result from an interaction of diet and genotype (F 1, 44 = 1.479, p = 0.23 for diet; F 1, 44 = 0.5160, p = 0.47 for genotype; F 1, 44 = 5.378, p = 0.02 for interaction) and does not appear to reflect altered locomotor competence since LDLR-H mice swam similar distances to the other groups during the probe trial ( Fig. 6C ). Moreover, all groups including the LDLR-H spent significantly more time exploring the target quadrant ( Fig. 6G ) indicating that all groups had learned the task (F values one way ANOVA, 32-41, p < 0.0001; Bonferroni post-tests p < 0.0001 for zone 3-target vs. each other quadrant). There were, in addition, no differences between the groups in the absolute time spent in the target quadrant ( Fig. 6G ), or the percent time spent in the target quadrant ( Fig. 6D ) during the probe trial. On balance these studies suggest that neither the LDLR genotype nor a high cholesterol diet have any major effects on performance in the Morris water maze. 3.7. Prepulse inhibition and acoustic startle Acoustic startle response profile and prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle response were examined. All groups showed a significant prepulse inhibition when the 125 dB pulse tone was preceded by the 79 dB prepulse tone ( Fig. 7 , p ? 0.0005 for all groups, paired t-test). The groups did not consistently differ in their response to acoustic startle (data not shown) or degree of prepulse inhibition ( Fig. 7 ).  3.1. Experimental design for manipulation of plasma cholesterol in LDLR-/- mice C57BL/6J mice fed a high cholesterol diet develop at most mild elevations in plasma cholesterol. LDLR -/- mice fed a standard low cholesterol rodent chow diet (?4-6% fat, 0.04% or less cholesterol) also develop only moderately increased plasma cholesterol levels and a slightly increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis [ 16 , 17 , 26 ]. However by increasing dietary cholesterol to 0.15% or greater [ 31 ], plasma cholesterol in LDLR-/- mice increases to over 1000 mg/dl, and within 16 weeks of dietary modification the animals develop extensive atherosclerotic lesions [ 2 , 20 ]. To test the effects of both the LDLR as well as elevated plasma cholesterol on behavioral function in LDLR-/- mice we fed C57BL/6J wild type mice and LDLR-/- mice either low (standard lab chow) or high cholesterol (0.15%) diets for 16 weeks at which time behavioral testing was begun. Testing was completed over an approximately 8-week time frame during which the mice were continued on standard lab chow or high cholesterol diets. Plasma cholesterol levels at the completion of behavioral testing are shown in Fig. 1 . Plasma cholesterol in C57BL/6J mice fed a standard lab chow diet (C57BL-L) was between 105-110 mg/dl and did not significantly differ in C57BL/6J mice receiving the high cholesterol diet (C57BL-H). By contrast, plasma cholesterol was over 500 mg/dl in LDLR-/- mice fed the low cholesterol diet (LDLR-L) and was over 1300 mg/dl in LDLR-/- mice on the high cholesterol diet (LDLR-H). A two-way ANOVA revealed the expected effects of both diet (F 1, 44 = 308.4, p < 0.0001) and genotype (F 1, 44 = 69.93, p < 0.0001) and a significant interaction of diet and genotype (F 1, 44 = 66.56, p < 0.0001) with plasma cholesterol increased in both LDLR groups compared to the respective C57BL/6J groups and in the high vs. low cholesterol fed LDLR groups (p < 0.001, Bonferroni post-tests).  3.2. General observations, spontaneous activity, and elicited behavior All animals were first evaluated for general health, certain stereotyped reflexes, motor coordination, and strength.

Prepulse inhibition and acoustic startle Acoustic startle response profile and prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle response were examined. All groups showed a significant prepulse inhibition when the 125 dB pulse tone was preceded by the 79 dB prepulse tone ( Fig. 7 , p ? 0.0005 for all groups, paired t-test). The groups did not consistently differ in their response to acoustic startle (data not shown) or degree of prepulse inhibition ( Fig. 7 ).  4. Discussion The LDLR was the first discovered of a large family of transmembrane receptors, several of which are known to play critical roles in regulating brain development. LDLR itself is expressed in the brain, and while it has generally been considered to be less important functionally in the nervous system [ 13 ] than other LDLR family members, several recent studies have suggested that LDLR may affect brain function [ 11 , 12 , 19 , 23 ]. We therefore undertook a detailed behavioral analysis of LDLR-/- mice and in addition given the interest in serum cholesterol as a possible risk factor for the cognitive dysfunction seen in AD [ 3 , 5 , 28 ], we used the fact that serum cholesterol levels can be modulated by diet in LDLR-/- mice [ 31 ] to examine the effects of systemic hypercholesterolemia on behavioral function as well. Except for the LDLR-/- mice fed the low cholesterol lab chow diet being slightly smaller than the other groups, there were no obvious physical differences between the groups. We also found that in general LDLR-/- mice exhibited no major deficits in sensory or motor function and there were likewise no substantial effects of the high cholesterol diet on general motor or sensory function. The most striking finding that distinguished LDLR mice from their C57BL/6J wild type controls was in the open field test where LDLR-/- mice spent more time in motion and moved a greater distance on both days of testing. The altered activity does not seem to be an effect of an altered anxiety levels, as LDLR and C57BL/6J mice spent comparable amounts of time in the center of the open field. There were also no genotype differences in the light/dark emergence or in the zero-maze tests to suggest that anxiety is altered by the absence of the LDLR, although while in the dark chamber LDLR-/- mice spent more time in motion, an additional indicator of increased locomotor activity. Collectively these studies thus seem best interpreted as indicating that LDLR-/- mice exhibit a general hyperactivity. Physiologically, these results suggest that LDLR regulates a general level of motor tone which is independent of anxiety and that the absence of LDLR leads to hyperactivity with a blunted response to at least some external sensory stimuli. By contrast, serum cholesterol had little impact on behavior. Indeed, the only diet dependent effect seen was that in the light/dark test a high cholesterol diet appeared to increase some indices of anxiety in both wild type as well as LDLR-/- mice, an effect that cannot be due to serum cholesterol, per se, since wild type mice fed the high cholesterol diet did not develop elevated serum cholesterol. This effect while curious is hard to interpret in isolation, especially given the lack of any dietary effect on anxiety in the open field. The only other notable effect of cholesterol was that on the probe trial in the Morris water maze, LDLR-/- mice fed the high cholesterol diet had longer latencies to reach the target site, an effect dependent on both diet and genotype. However, this effect was likely to have been performance related since during the probe trial, the LDLR-H mice exhibited no other differences from the other groups, spending more time as well as a greater percentage of time exploring the target quadrant, indicating that the LDLR-H mice learned and remembered the task like all the other groups. Indeed while longer term exposure to elevated serum cholesterol may eventually impact behavior, the 16-week exposure studied here seems to have had few if any behavioral effects. This lack of effect is, however, consistent with our recent findings that dramatically elevated plasma cholesterol levels in LDLR-/- mice, whether induced by high cholesterol, high fat, or high fat/high cholesterol diets, do not substantially alter brain cholesterol levels nor affect levels of brain A? 40 or 42 [ 11 ]. Some aspects of our findings differ from a prior behavioral analysis of LDLR-/- mice [ 23 ] in which 26-week old LDLR-/- mice maintained on a low cholesterol lab chow diet were tested. Unlike our studies, they saw no changes in the behavior of LDLR-/- mice in the open field, while finding that in the Morris water, although LDLR-/- mice learned the task as judged by decreasing latencies during the acquisition phase, in the probe trial they spent no more time in the target quadrant than could be accounted for by chance [ 23 ]. In that study, memory impairment was also supported by the performance of LDLR-/- mice in a T-maze. The reasons for these differing results from those presented here is unclear. While the prior studies [ 23 ] also used only male mice with a stock originally obtained from the Jackson laboratories, they were performed after crossing to a distinct C57BL/6J background (C57Black/6J/Icco), raising the possibility that genetic background effects may account for the differing results. It is noteworthy that the mice in the current study received two more days of training (8 more trials) in the water maze than the mice in the Mulder et al. [ 23 ] study. It is possible that probe trial differences between groups could have been revealed following fewer learning trials. Yet whatever the explanation for the differing results, these studies suggest that while the absence of LDLR may produce no major developmental defects, LDLR nevertheless plays a role in modulating behavior in the adult.
