Neutrophil sandwiches injure the microcirculation Experiments in two mouse models of thromboinflammatory disease show how neutrophils stick to red blood cells and plateletsâ€”leading to reduced blood flow and damage to the microcirculation. Polarized expression of ?M?2 integrins on neutrophils helps set the process in motion (pages 384?391).
