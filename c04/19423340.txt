Novel C-seco-taxoids possessing high potency against paclitaxel-resistant cancer cell lines overexpressing class III ?-tubulin Novel C-seco-taxoids were synthesized from 10-deacetylbaccatin III and their potencies evaluated against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cell lines. The drug-resistant cell lines include ovarian cancer cell lines resistant to cisplatin, topotecan, adriamycin and paclitaxel overexpressing class III ?-tubulin, A2780TC1 and A2780TC3. The last two cell lines were selected through chronic exposure of A2780wt to paclitaxel and Pgp blocker cyclosporine. All novel C-seco-taxoids exhibited remarkable potency against A2780TC1 and A2780TC3 cell lines, and no cross resistance to cisplatin- and topotecan-resistant cell lines, A2780CIS and A2780TOP. Four of those C-seco-taxoids exhibit much higher activities than IDN5390 against paclitaxel-resistant cell lines, A2780ADR, A2780TC1 and A2780TC3. SB-CST-10202 possesses the best all-round high potencies across different drug-resistant cell lines. Molecular modeling studies, including molecular dynamics simulations, on the drug-protein complexes of class I and III ?-tubulins were performed to identify possible cause of the remarkable potency of these C-seco-taxoids against paclitaxel-resistant cell lines overexpressing class III ?-tubulin.
