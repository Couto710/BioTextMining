Convection-Enhanced Delivery for the Treatment of Pediatric Neurologic Disorders Direct perfusion of specific regions of the central nervous system by convection-enhanced delivery is becoming more widely used for the delivery of compounds in the research and treatment of various neural disorders. In contrast to other currently available central nervous system delivery techniques, convection-enhanced delivery relies on bulk flow for distribution of solute. This allows for safe, targeted, reliable, and homogeneous delivery of small- and large-molecular-weight substances over clinically relevant volumes in a manner that bypasses the blood-central nervous system barrier. Recent studies have also shown that coinfused imaging surrogate tracers can be used to monitor and control the convective distribution of therapeutic agents in vivo. The unique features of convection-enhanced delivery, including the ability to monitor distribution in real-time, provide an opportunity to develop new research and treatment paradigms for pediatric patients with a variety of intrinsic central nervous system disorders.
