Common variants on 9q22.33 and 14q13.3 predispose to thyroid cancer in European populations In order to search for sequence variants conferring risk of thyroid cancer we conducted a genome-wide association study in 192 and 37,196 Icelandic cases and controls, respectively, followed by a replication study in individuals of European descent. Here we show that two common variants, located on 9q22.33 and 14q13.3, are associated with the disease. Overall, the strongest association signals were observed for rs965513 on 9q22.33 (OR = 1.75; P = 1.7 × 10?27) and rs944289 on 14q13.3 (OR = 1.37; P = 2.0 × 10?9). The gene nearest to the 9q22.33 locus is FOXE1 ( TTF2 ) and NKX2-1 ( TTF1 ) is among the genes located at the 14q13.3 locus. Both variants contribute to an increased risk of both papillary and follicular thyroid cancer. Approximately 3.7% of individuals are homozygous for both variants, and their estimated risk of thyroid cancer is 5.7-fold greater than that of noncarriers. In a study on a large sample set from the general population, both risk alleles are associated with low concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and the 9q22.33 allele is associated with low concentration of thyroxin (T4) and high concentration of triiodothyronine (T3).  METHODS Subjects Icelandic study population Individuals diagnosed with thyroid cancer were identified on the basis of a nationwide list from the Icelandic Cancer Registry (ICR) (see URLs section below) that contained all 1,110 Icelandic subjects with thyroid cancer diagnosed from January 1, 1955 to December 31, 2007. Of these, 1,097 were nonmedullary thyroid cancers. The Icelandic thyroid cancer study population consists of 460 subjects (diagnosed from December 1974 to June 2007) recruited from November 2000 until April 2008, of whom 454 (98%) were successfully genotyped in this study. The histology of all thyroid carcinomas used in the present study has been reviewed and confirmed by one of the authors of this article (J.G.J.). A total of 192 subjects were included in a genome-wide SNP genotyping effort, using Illumina Sentrix HumanHap300 ( n = 96) and HumanCNV370-duo Bead Chip ( n = 96) microarrays (Illumina) and were successfully genotyped according to our quality control criteria (see below) and used in the present case-control association analysis. The remaining 241 cases were genotyped using the Centaurs single-track genotyping platform (see below). The mean age at diagnosis for the consenting subjects was 44 y (median 43 y) and the range was from 13 to 87 y. The mean age at diagnosis was 56 y for all subjects with thyroid cancer in the ICR. The median time from diagnosis to blood sampling was 10 y (range 0 to 46 y). When we compared the frequency of rs965513[A] between individuals diagnosed before 1998 and those diagnosed 1998 or later no significant difference was observed ( P = 0.97). The 37,202 controls (16,109 males (43.3%) and 21,093 females (56.7%)) used in this study consisted of individuals belonging to different genetic research projects at deCODE. The individuals have been diagnosed with common diseases of the cardiovascular system (for example, stroke or myocardial infarction), psychiatric and neurological diseases (for example, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), endocrine and autoimmune system diseases (for example, type 2 diabetes, asthma) and malignant diseases (for example, cancer of the breast or prostate), and also included are individuals randomly selected from the Icelandic genealogical database. No single disease project represented more than 6% of the total number of controls. The controls had a mean age of 84 y and the range was from 8 to 105 y. A linear regression analysis showed no correlation between allele frequency of rs965513[A] and year of birth among the Icelandic controls ( P > 0.2). The controls were absent from the nationwide list of individuals with thyroid cancer according to the ICR. The DNA for both the Icelandic cases and controls was isolated from whole blood using standard methods. The study was approved by the Data Protection Commission of Iceland and the National Bioethics Committee of Iceland. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Personal identifiers associated with medical information and blood samples were encrypted with a third-party encryption system as previously described 22 . Columbus, Ohio, United States The study was approved by the institutional review board of Ohio State University. All subjects provided written informed consent. Cases ( n = 342) were individuals with histologically confirmed papillary thyroid carcinoma (including traditional PTC and follicular variant PTC). These subjects were admitted to the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, with the exception of one case obtained through Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN); this case was admitted to the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. All cases were of European descent (92 men, 250 women, median age 40 y, range 13 to 88 y). The genomic DNA was extracted either from blood samples, or fresh frozen normal thyroid tissues from individuals with PTC. Controls ( n = 384) were individuals without clinically diagnosed thyroid cancers from central Ohio area. All controls were of European descent (143 men, 241 women, median age 51 y, range 18 to 94 y). Spain The Spanish study population consisted of 90 individuals with thyroid cancer. The subjects were recruited from the Oncology Department of Zaragoza Hospital in Zaragoza, Spain, from October 2006 to June 2007. All subjects were of self-reported European descent. Clinical information including age at onset, grade and stage was obtained from medical records. The average age at diagnosis for the subjects was 48 y (median 49 y) and the range was from 22 to 79 y. The 1,343 Spanish control individuals (579 (43%) males and 764 (57%) females), who had a mean age of 51 (median age 50 and range 12–87 y) were approached at the University Hospital in Zaragoza, Spain, and were not known to have thyroid cancer. The DNA for both the Spanish cases and controls was isolated from whole blood using standard methods. Study protocols were approved by the institutional review board of Zaragoza University Hospital. All subjects gave written informed consent. Statistical analysis Association analysis We used a likelihood procedure described in a previous publication 23 and implemented in the NEMO software for the association analyses. An attempt was made to genotype all individuals for the SNPs reported in Table 1 . The yield was higher than 95% for the SNPs in every group. We tested the association of an allele with thyroid cancer using a standard likelihood ratio statistic that, if the subjects were unrelated, would have asymptotically a ?;2 distribution with one degree of freedom under the null hypothesis. Allelic frequencies rather than carrier frequencies are presented for the markers in the main text. Allele-specific ORs and associated P values were calculated assuming a multiplicative model for the two chromosomes of an individual 24 . For each of the three case-control groups there was no significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the controls ( P > 0.3). Results from multiple case-control groups were combined using a Mantel-Haenszel model 25 in which the groups were allowed to have different population frequencies for alleles and genotypes but were assumed to have common relative risks (see ref. 26 for a more detailed description of the association analysis). Correction for relatedness and genomic control Some individuals in the Icelandic GWAS group were related to each other, causing the aforementioned ?2 test statistic to have a mean >1. We estimated the inflation factor by using a method of genomic control 14 , calculating the average of the 304,083 ?2 statistics. According to this method the inflation factor was estimated to be 1.09. On the basis of the change in sample size of genotyped and in silico genotyped cases due to single assay genotyping, we estimated the inflation factor in the combined Icelandic sample set to be 1.12 (ref. 27 ). The ?2 statistics for the test for association with thyroid cancer in the combined Icelandic samples presented in the main text and Table 1 were adjusted accordingly.
