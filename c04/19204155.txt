A Specific ELISA for Measuring Amyloid ?-Protein Oligomers in Human Plasma and the Brains of Alzheimer Patients 1. Objective A new ELISA specific for oligomeric assemblies of amyloid ? protein (oA?) was developed to examine in vivo levels of oA? vs. monomeric A? in sporadic and familial Alzheimer disease (AD) plasma and brain tissue. 2. Design To establish the oA? ELISA, the same N-terminal A? antibody was used for antigen capture and detection. Plasmas and postmortem brains from AD and control subjects were systematically analyzed by conventional monomeric A? and new oA? ELISAs. 3. Subjects We measured oA? species in plasma samples from 36 clinically well-characterized AD patients and 10 controls. In addition, postmortem samples were obtained from brain autopsies of 9 verified AD and 7 control subjects. 4. Results The specificity of oA? ELISA was validated with a disulfide crossed-linked, synthetic A?1–40Ser26Cys dimer that was specifically detected before but not after the dissociation of the dimers in ?-mercaptoethanol. Plasma assays showed that relative oA? levels were closely associated with relative A?42 monomer levels across all subjects. Analysis of sequential plasma samples from a subset of the AD patients, including a patient with AD caused by a presenilin mutation, revealed decreases in both oA? and A?42 monomer levels over a 1–2 year period. In brain tissue from 9 AD and 7 control subjects, both oA? and monomeric A?42 were consistently higher in the AD cases. 6. Conclusions An oA?-specific ELISA reveals a tight link between oA? and A?42 monomer levels in plasma and brain, and both forms can decline over time in plasma, presumably reflecting their increasing insolubility in the brain.  Introduction Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The protein subunit of the amyloid plaques, amyloid ?-protein (A?), does not occur as a single molecular species; many different A?-containing peptides have been detected in human CSF and/or brain 1 , 2 . The most common A? isoform in vivo is A?1–40, i.e., a peptide that begins at Asp1 and terminates at Val40 of the A? region of APP. Increased accumulation of A?1–42, a peptide that differs from A?1–40 by the inclusion of Ile41 and Ala42, is particularly associated with development of AD. The extra two hydrophobic amino acids of A?42 greatly enhance its aggregation propensity 3 , leading to accelerated formation of small (low-n) A? oligomers (oA?), larger intermediate assemblies like protofibrils, and eventually the typical ~8 nm amyloid fibrils found abundantly in neuritic plaques and amyloid-bearing microvessels. Small, soluble oligomers of A? have been linked to neuronal toxicity and synaptic failure (for review, see 4 ). How the oligomeric assemblies reach a balance with monomeric A? and large protofibrils and fibrils in human brain is under investigation. Studies of circulating A? in blood have provided insights into A? equilibrium between the brain and the periphery. A few studies have associated increased levels of plasma A?42 with AD at different stages. For example, an increase in plasma A?42 was associated with conversion from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and on to AD, albeit with unsatisfactory sensitivity and specificity 5 . Another study found that patients with AD at baseline and those who developed AD later had significantly higher plasma A?42 levels; some of the AD patients showed elevated levels of A?42 and A?40 before and during the early stages of AD, but plasma levels declined thereafter 6 , 7 . Another study showed that non-demented subjects with high levels of plasma A?42 were more than twice as likely to develop AD than those with low levels, and that AD patients showed higher A?42 levels than non-AD controls 8 . Familial AD (FAD) patients having mutations in the presenilins, the catalytic subunits of the ?-secretase complex that generates A?, have increased plasma levels of A?42 9 . Plasma A?42 levels and the A?42/A?40 ratio were higher even in presymptomatic subjects carrying FAD mutations in PS1 or APP, and A?42 may decrease with disease progression prior to symptom onset 10 . In some typical (late-onset) AD cases, elevated plasma A?42 has been linked to a locus on Chromosome 10 11 , and some first degree relatives of late-onset AD patients have elevated A?42, suggesting that increased plasma A? is a heritable trait 12 , 13 . Plasma A? is a potentially promising but understudied candidate marker for diagnosis and pre-clinical prediction. However, plasma A?40 or A?42 was found not to be an optimal candidate in unbiased proteomic searches for AD fluid biomarkers 14 , 15 . In one study, increased plasma A?42 was detected in MCI patients, but a significant association was only observed in women 16 . In a cohort of men at age 70, plasma A?40 and A?42 were not associated with incident AD at follow-up, whereas low plasma A?40 in another cohort of men at age 77 was associated with higher incidence of AD 17 . Yet another study found that subjects with low plasma A?42/A?40 ratios had higher risk of MCI or AD and greater cognitive decline 18 . A correlation between increased plasma A?40 and increased risk of dementia has also been reported 19 . A recent studies of MCI patients followed up to 7 years showed no significant difference of plasma A? species between MCI patients that later developed AD and stable MCI patients or healthy controls 20 . These often inconsistent reports on the association of plasma A? levels with AD may reflect the fact that measurements to date only represent the pools of monomeric A? and were measured by different A? ELISAs 21 . To understand the relationship among different A? species in vivo, we developed an ELISA that can detect oA? and simultaneously measured both A? monomers and oA? in human plasma or in postmortem brain tissue. Levels of human oA? detected by our new oA?-specific ELISA were closely associated with the levels of monomeric A?42. Levels of both soluble and insoluble A?42 and oligomeric A? species were significantly higher in AD brains compared to controls. We also observed decreases in plasma A? in follow up samples from the same patients 1–2 years later. The development of an oligomer-specific ELISA applicable to plasma extends A? measurement to a highly relevant neurotoxic form of this pathogenic peptide.  Material and Methods Plasma and brain lysate preparation Blood samples were collected in K2-EDTA-containing collection tubes and centrifuged at 1600 g for 15 min. The plasma supernatant was aliquoted and stored at ?80°C until measured. Average ages for AD patients and control subjects at time of blood drawing were 72 (n=36) and 62 years old (n=10), respectively. Brain lysates from postmortem human brains (n=16) were prepared as recently described 22 . ELISAs and antibodies Sandwich ELISAs for monomeric A? were performed as described 23 . The use of C-terminal capturing antibody and N-terminal or mid-region detecting antibodies has been a standard format for measuring monomeric A? species in many studies 9 , 24 – 26 . The capture antibodies 2G3 (to A? residues 33–40) and 21F12 (to A? residues 33–42) were used for A?40 and A?42 species, respectively. The detecting antibodies were biotinylated 3D6 (to A? residues 1–5) for A?1–40/42 or biotinylated 266 (to A? residues 13–28) for A?x-40/42 species. These antibodies were kindly provided by P. Seubert and D. Schenk (Elan, plc). To detect oA? species, the same N-terminal antibody, either 82E1 (to A? residues 1–16; Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) or else 3D6, was used for both capture and detection. An identical sandwich ELISA procedure as for the traditional monomer assays was followed to measure relative oA? levels, which were calculated using standard curves of synthetic A?1–40 peptide captured by 2G3 antibody and measured by same detecting antibodies (82E1 or 3D6). Stable cell lines and cell culture CHO cells stably expressing wt human APP751 plus either wt or mutant PS1 [resulting in lines PS1wt-1, PS1wt-2, PS1wt-3, PS1M146L-1, PS1M146L-2 PS1M146L–M146L missense mutation), and PS1C410Y-1, PS1C410Y-2, PS1C410Y-3 (C410Y missense mutation)] were maintained in 200 ug/ml G418 (InVitrogen) plus 25 ug/ml puromycin (for PS1). We also examined CHO lines singly transfected with wt APP751 or APP751 bearing the V717F (“Indiana”) missense mutation. Cells were incubated in methionine-free, fetal bovine serum-free media for 45 min before labeling with 200 uCi/ml [ 35 S]-methionine for 38 hr. Conditioned media were collected, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described 25 . Production & characterization of cross-linked A? dimers A ? dimers were generated by atmospheric oxidation of a 20 uM solution of synthetic A?1–40Ser26Cys in 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, for 4 days at room temperature. To facilitate disassembly of aggregates formed during the oxidation reaction, the peptide solution was lyophilized and the lyophilate incubated in 5 M GuHCl, 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 4 hours. Disulfide crossed-linked A? dimers were isolated from unreacted monomer and higher aggregates by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 10/30 HR column eluted with 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 8.5, at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, an aliquot of each electrophoresed on 16% Tris-tricine polyacrylamide gels, and protein detected by silver staining. SEC fractions found to contain exclusively dimeric A? were pooled and used as the dimer stock. The concentration of peptides in stock solutions was determined by comparison to wild type A?1–40 of known concentration. Once collected, all samples were stored at ?80oC until used. To disrupt the disulfide bonds linking the monomers, dimeric A? was treated with 3% ?-mercaptoethanol (?ME), followed by serial dilutions for quantification by ELISA. The diluted, residual amount of ?ME did not interfere with the capture and detecting antibodies. A?1–40Ser26Cys was synthesized by the Biopolymer Laboratory in the Department of Neurology at UCLA Medical Center and the correct sequence and purity confirmed by amino acid analysis, reverse-phase HPLC and mass spectrometry.  Plasma and brain lysate preparation Blood samples were collected in K2-EDTA-containing collection tubes and centrifuged at 1600 g for 15 min. The plasma supernatant was aliquoted and stored at ?80°C until measured.

Results Establishing an oA?-specific ELISA To analyze oA? species in human samples, we established a sensitive and specific oA? ELISA. The assay relies on the use of a single monoclonal antibody for both capture and detection. Thus, for oA? to be detected by this sandwich ELISA, an A? assembly must contain at least two exposed copies of the same epitope that is accessible by the identical capturing and detecting antibody 27 , 28 . This means that this assay will recognize only A? assemblies that contain at least two A? molecules. Two monoclonal antibodies, 82E1 and 3D6 that each recognize the extreme N-terminus of human A?, were tested. To confirm the specificity of the ELISA, we utilized a synthetic A? peptide, A?1–40 Ser26Cys, that is capable of reversibly forming covalently cross-linked A? dimers (dA?) under oxidizing conditions 22 , 29 . Disulfide crossed-linked A? dimers were separated from unreacted monomer and higher aggregates by size exclusion chromatography. The concentration of dA? in stock solutions was determined by comparison to wild type (wt) synthetic A?1–40 of known concentration; both dA? and monomeric wt A? peptides were detected by SDS-PAGE and silver staining ( Fig. 1A ). Based on the densitometric signal obtained from synthetic wt A?1–40 peptide, we estimated that the concentration of our synthetic dA? stock was 81 uM. In the presence of 3% ?-mercaptoethanol (?ME), the disulfide bonds linking the monomers that form dA? were disrupted, producing a reduced monomer ( Fig. 1B ). In the absence of ?ME, no monomeric A? was detected, and the vast majority of A? species was dA? ( Fig. 1B ). Serial dilutions of dA? were made after the dA? stock was treated with or without ?ME, and the diluted samples were assayed using either antibody 82E1 ( Fig. 1C ) or 3D6 ( Fig. 1D ) in a sandwich format. When the relative levels of the diluted dA? (800 pM) of the dA? stock were normalized to 1, either monoclonal antibody detected a clear linear reduction in the levels of dA? when further diluted to 400 and 200 pM ( Fig. 1C ). In the presence of ?ME, dissociation of the disulfide bond markedly reduced the amount of dA? signal, and the levels of remaining dA? were less than 10% of the same fraction without ?ME, with 82E1 showing even greater specificity than 3D6 in this regard ( Fig. 1C, D ). Therefore, our new ELISA accurately measured the levels of dA? in a linear fashion and is highly sensitive to the dissociation of dA? to monomers. Quantifying oligomeric plasma A? from AD patients Using the oA?-specific ELISA, we screened plasma samples obtained from 36 well-characterized AD patients and 10 control subjects. The ages of the AD subjects ranged from 50 to 90 at the time of blood sampling, with average age at 72. The age of control subjects ranged from 52 to 68, with average age at 62. Conventional A? ELISAs were applied to measure monomeric A? species. We analyzed plasma levels of oA? as a function of subject age but did not observe an age-dependent alteration of oA? levels ( Fig. 2 ). There were a number of subjects who carried high plasma levels of oA?-reactive species, with a wide age distribution between 60 and 90. Overall, we found that most (7/10) control subjects had plasma levels of oA? below our detection limit, whereas more than half (19/36) AD subjects had detectable oA? levels ( Fig. 2 ). From the same aliquot of plasma, we measured four monomeric A? species using four distinct ELISAs: A?1–40, A?1–42, and N-terminally heterogeneous A?40 and A?42 species (i.e., A?x-40 and A?x-42). The levels of A?1–40 and A?x-40 did not reveal a clear separation of AD subjects from control subjects ( Fig. 3A and B ). On average, the levels of A?x-40 were higher than those of A?1–40 (note scales on the ordinates of Figs. 3A and B ), indicating that a variable portion of plasma A?40 is N-terminally truncated. When the levels of A?x-42 ( Fig. 3C ) and A?1–42 ( Fig. 3D ) were analyzed from the same aliquots of plasma, we found that the levels of A?1–42 species were generally lower than those of A?1–40 species, and that the levels of A?x-42 were likewise lower than A?x-40 (compare Figs 3A, B to C, D ). Close association of levels of monomeric A? 42 and oligomeric A? in human plasma We calculated the average plasma A? levels for each of the four ELISAs in all AD and control subjects. Plasma levels of A? 40 and A?x-42 did not differ significantly between AD and controls ( Fig. 4A ). However, the average plasma levels of both A?1–42 and oA? were found to be significantly higher in AD subjects than controls ( Fig. 4A ). Furthermore, the relative levels of A?1–42 and oA? were closely associated. For this, we chose a threshold of 10 pM for A?1–42 (i.e., readily detectable above baseline) and identified 7 subjects that carried >10 pM levels of A?1–42 ( Fig. 4B ). Next, we identified 7 subjects that carried higher levels of oA? than the remaining subjects ( Fig. 4C ). We found that the subjects that carried >10 pM levels of A?1–42 ( Fig. 4B ) were the same subjects that carried high levels of oA? ( Fig. 4C ), and the relative levels of A?1–42 and oA? for each subject were tightly linked. Except for one patient who had the highest oA? level ( Fig. 4C , arrow) but had relative low A?1–42 ( Fig. 4B , arrow), our oA? ELISA clearly detected oA?-reactive species whose levels were tightly associated with those of monomeric A?1–42. Concomitant increases of monomeric and oligomeric A?42 in cultured cells To further validate the close association of monomeric A?42 with oA? detected by our oA? ELISA, we analyzed these A? species generated from cell lines expressing FAD-causing mutations in either APP or PS1. These cell lines have elevated A?42 monomer levels and secrete SDS-stable low-n A? oligomers into the media 25 , 30 , 31 . Similar to our AD and control cases that carry different levels of plasma A?, we have found variable levels of A? produced from multiple stable cell lines expressing wt or mutant (M146L or C410Y) PS1 and wt or mutant (V717F) APP. These lines were metabolically labeled with [35S]-Met, and the conditioned media were immunoprecipitated with antibody 21F12 (to A? ending at residue 42) or 1282 (a pan-A? polyclonal antibody) and analyzed by gel fluorography. Antibody 21F12 immunoprecipitated both monomeric A?42 and the p342 species (generated by sequential ?- and ?-secretase cleavages of APP) from the conditioned media of all cell lines. In media from APPV717F and PS1M146L-2 cells, additional A?42-immunoreactive bands migrating at ~5 kDa, 8–10 kDa and 12–14 kDa (collectively designated SDS-stable low-n oligomers) were also detected ( Fig. 5 , upper panel). Light exposure of blots separating A?42 monomer from oA? indicated that more A?42 was produced from cells expressing APPV717F or mutant PS1 (PSM146L-2) ( Fig. 5 , middle panel). The levels of oA? were correlated to the levels of monomeric A?42, i.e. the cell lines secreting elevated A?42 also had higher levels of oligomers in their media. We further examined the levels of total A? precipitated by antiserum 1282 but did not observe an elevation in total A? signal corresponding to those of A?42 and oA?. Thus, the amounts of total A? generated by cells expressing APPV717F or mutant PS1 (PSM146L-2) were comparable to those from the other cell lines ( Fig. 5 , bottom panel). Moreover, no oA? species were detected in these immunoprecipitates of total A?, suggesting that the oA? species made by the cells are principally composed of A?42. These results in well-defined cultured cell lines support our finding in human plasma that levels of oA? are closely associated with those of monomeric A?42. Declining plasma A?42 levels over 1–2 years The close association of monomeric A?42 and oA? levels suggests a dynamic conversion between these two A? species. To examine further the relationship of A?42 and oA? in vivo, we obtained sequential blood samples from a symptomatic FAD patient carrying a mutant PS1 gene. Blood samples were drawn at ages 58 and 60. A? levels were quantified by separate ELISAs for oA? and the four monomeric A? species ( Table 1 ). For oA? species, we observed a significant decrease, so that oA? was no longer detectable at age 60. For monomeric A?, the plasma concentrations of A?1–40 and A?x-40 were 48 and 84 pM, respectively, at age 58. The concentration of A?1–42 was 7 pM, and that of A?x-42 was 36 pM. The plasma A?42/A?total ratio was in the same range as those reported in patients carrying FAD-causing PS1 mutations 9 . Plasma samples collected 22 months later had significantly lower A? concentrations: the level of A?1–40 measured 36 pM (25% reduction), and A?1–42 was now undetectable ( Table 1 ). A?x-40 and A?x-42 declined to 48 pM (43% reduction) and 15 pM (58% reduction), respectively. Thus, while the levels of both A? species dropped over two years, A?42-ending species were reduced more dramatically than A?40-ending species. The complete loss of the A?1–42 and oA? signals is consistent with our findings above that the levels of these two species are closely associated. We also obtained sequential blood samples from a subset of our AD patients (n=12, including the FAD patient described above) and compared their A? levels over a 1–2 year span. All five A? species were again measured by ELISA, and the change in A? levels calculated. A similar number of subjects showed increased or decreased levels of A?1–40 over the course of 1–2 years ( Fig. 6A ), failing to show a clear temporal trend in A?1–40. Comparison of A?x-40 levels revealed 3 out of 11 subjects with an increased A?x-40 and the remaining 8 subjects had a reduced A?x-40 ( Fig. 6B ). In the 4 AD subjects with detectable plasma A?1–42 levels ( Fig. 6C ), three subjects showed a dramatic reduction in A?1–42 after one year, whereas one subject displayed almost identical levels of A?1–42 at both times. The latter subject also maintained similar levels of oA? after one year, whereas 3 AD subjects with detectable oA? levels had a reduction in relative plasma oA? ( Fig. 6E ). Thus, the drop of A?1–42 levels occurred in subjects who also showed a similar drop in oA? levels. Strikingly, all but one subject showed decreases in A?x-42 in the second plasma samples ( Fig. 6D ). Elevated levels of monomeric A?42 and oligomeric A? in brains of AD patients To investigate the association of monomeric A?42 and oA? directly in human brains, we obtained postmortem brain tissues from 9 AD cases and 7 age-matched control cases distinct from the subjects examined in the plasma A? studies above. We performed sequential extractions of brain tissues to obtain “soluble” (Tris-buffered saline (TBS)) and “insoluble” (Guanidine (Gu) HCl) extracts and measured their A? contents by ELISA. The soluble pool of brain A? extracted by TBS had relatively low levels of A?1–40 ( Fig. 7A ); an average of 1.1 pmol/g of A?1–40 was detected in the AD cases vs. 0.7 pmol/g in the controls (not statistically significant). The average level of TBS-soluble A?1–42 was significantly higher in AD than control cases ( Fig. 7B ). Likewise, the relative levels of TBS-soluble oA? were significantly higher in AD cases, as most control cases had almost undetectable levels of soluble oA? ( Fig. 7C ). After the extraction of soluble A? by TBS, the resultant pellets were further extracted in GuHCl to obtain the insoluble pools of A?. Overall, insoluble A?1–42 levels ( Fig. 7E ) were several hundred-fold higher than soluble A?1–42 levels ( Fig. 7B ), and they were almost ten fold higher than insoluble A?1–40 levels ( Fig. 7D ). This is consistent with numerous previous reports that amyloid deposits in AD brain are mainly composed of A?42. The levels of both insoluble A?1–40 and A?1–42 were significantly higher in brains from AD cases than those from control cases. Furthermore, a substantial and significant increase in the relative levels of insoluble oA? was observed in AD brains ( Fig. 7F ). Importantly, brain levels of insoluble A?1–42 were closely associated with the levels of oA? in both AD patients and control subjects (correlation coefficient, AD=0.88; ND=0.98). For example, one AD case (AD4) showed relatively low levels of A?1–42, and accordingly, its oA? level was low. Another control case (ND3) showed a relatively high level of A?1–42, corresponding to a high level of oA? ( Fig. 7F ). On average, significantly higher levels of all three insoluble A? species (A?1–40, A?1–42 and oA?) were found in AD brain tissues, compared to control cases ( Fig. 7 D–F ).  Results Establishing an oA?-specific ELISA To analyze oA? species in human samples, we established a sensitive and specific oA? ELISA. The assay relies on the use of a single monoclonal antibody for both capture and detection. Thus, for oA? to be detected by this sandwich ELISA, an A? assembly must contain at least two exposed copies of the same epitope that is accessible by the identical capturing and detecting antibody 27 , 28 . This means that this assay will recognize only A? assemblies that contain at least two A? molecules. Two monoclonal antibodies, 82E1 and 3D6 that each recognize the extreme N-terminus of human A?, were tested. To confirm the specificity of the ELISA, we utilized a synthetic A? peptide, A?1–40 Ser26Cys, that is capable of reversibly forming covalently cross-linked A? dimers (dA?) under oxidizing conditions 22 , 29 . Disulfide crossed-linked A? dimers were separated from unreacted monomer and higher aggregates by size exclusion chromatography. The concentration of dA? in stock solutions was determined by comparison to wild type (wt) synthetic A?1–40 of known concentration; both dA? and monomeric wt A? peptides were detected by SDS-PAGE and silver staining ( Fig. 1A ). Based on the densitometric signal obtained from synthetic wt A?1–40 peptide, we estimated that the concentration of our synthetic dA? stock was 81 uM. In the presence of 3% ?-mercaptoethanol (?ME), the disulfide bonds linking the monomers that form dA? were disrupted, producing a reduced monomer ( Fig. 1B ). In the absence of ?ME, no monomeric A? was detected, and the vast majority of A? species was dA? ( Fig. 1B ). Serial dilutions of dA? were made after the dA? stock was treated with or without ?ME, and the diluted samples were assayed using either antibody 82E1 ( Fig. 1C ) or 3D6 ( Fig. 1D ) in a sandwich format. When the relative levels of the diluted dA? (800 pM) of the dA? stock were normalized to 1, either monoclonal antibody detected a clear linear reduction in the levels of dA? when further diluted to 400 and 200 pM ( Fig. 1C ). In the presence of ?ME, dissociation of the disulfide bond markedly reduced the amount of dA? signal, and the levels of remaining dA? were less than 10% of the same fraction without ?ME, with 82E1 showing even greater specificity than 3D6 in this regard ( Fig. 1C, D ). Therefore, our new ELISA accurately measured the levels of dA? in a linear fashion and is highly sensitive to the dissociation of dA? to monomers. Quantifying oligomeric plasma A? from AD patients Using the oA?-specific ELISA, we screened plasma samples obtained from 36 well-characterized AD patients and 10 control subjects. The ages of the AD subjects ranged from 50 to 90 at the time of blood sampling, with average age at 72. The age of control subjects ranged from 52 to 68, with average age at 62. Conventional A? ELISAs were applied to measure monomeric A? species. We analyzed plasma levels of oA? as a function of subject age but did not observe an age-dependent alteration of oA? levels ( Fig. 2 ). There were a number of subjects who carried high plasma levels of oA?-reactive species, with a wide age distribution between 60 and 90. Overall, we found that most (7/10) control subjects had plasma levels of oA? below our detection limit, whereas more than half (19/36) AD subjects had detectable oA? levels ( Fig. 2 ). From the same aliquot of plasma, we measured four monomeric A? species using four distinct ELISAs: A?1–40, A?1–42, and N-terminally heterogeneous A?40 and A?42 species (i.e., A?x-40 and A?x-42). The levels of A?1–40 and A?x-40 did not reveal a clear separation of AD subjects from control subjects ( Fig. 3A and B ). On average, the levels of A?x-40 were higher than those of A?1–40 (note scales on the ordinates of Figs. 3A and B ), indicating that a variable portion of plasma A?40 is N-terminally truncated. When the levels of A?x-42 ( Fig. 3C ) and A?1–42 ( Fig. 3D ) were analyzed from the same aliquots of plasma, we found that the levels of A?1–42 species were generally lower than those of A?1–40 species, and that the levels of A?x-42 were likewise lower than A?x-40 (compare Figs 3A, B to C, D ). Close association of levels of monomeric A? 42 and oligomeric A? in human plasma We calculated the average plasma A? levels for each of the four ELISAs in all AD and control subjects. Plasma levels of A? 40 and A?x-42 did not differ significantly between AD and controls ( Fig. 4A ). However, the average plasma levels of both A?1–42 and oA? were found to be significantly higher in AD subjects than controls ( Fig. 4A ). Furthermore, the relative levels of A?1–42 and oA? were closely associated. For this, we chose a threshold of 10 pM for A?1–42 (i.e., readily detectable above baseline) and identified 7 subjects that carried >10 pM levels of A?1–42 ( Fig. 4B ). Next, we identified 7 subjects that carried higher levels of oA? than the remaining subjects ( Fig. 4C ). We found that the subjects that carried >10 pM levels of A?1–42 ( Fig. 4B ) were the same subjects that carried high levels of oA? ( Fig. 4C ), and the relative levels of A?1–42 and oA? for each subject were tightly linked. Except for one patient who had the highest oA? level ( Fig. 4C , arrow) but had relative low A?1–42 ( Fig. 4B , arrow), our oA? ELISA clearly detected oA?-reactive species whose levels were tightly associated with those of monomeric A?1–42. Concomitant increases of monomeric and oligomeric A?42 in cultured cells To further validate the close association of monomeric A?42 with oA? detected by our oA? ELISA, we analyzed these A? species generated from cell lines expressing FAD-causing mutations in either APP or PS1. These cell lines have elevated A?42 monomer levels and secrete SDS-stable low-n A? oligomers into the media 25 , 30 , 31 . Similar to our AD and control cases that carry different levels of plasma A?, we have found variable levels of A? produced from multiple stable cell lines expressing wt or mutant (M146L or C410Y) PS1 and wt or mutant (V717F) APP. These lines were metabolically labeled with [35S]-Met, and the conditioned media were immunoprecipitated with antibody 21F12 (to A? ending at residue 42) or 1282 (a pan-A? polyclonal antibody) and analyzed by gel fluorography. Antibody 21F12 immunoprecipitated both monomeric A?42 and the p342 species (generated by sequential ?- and ?-secretase cleavages of APP) from the conditioned media of all cell lines. In media from APPV717F and PS1M146L-2 cells, additional A?42-immunoreactive bands migrating at ~5 kDa, 8–10 kDa and 12–14 kDa (collectively designated SDS-stable low-n oligomers) were also detected ( Fig. 5 , upper panel). Light exposure of blots separating A?42 monomer from oA? indicated that more A?42 was produced from cells expressing APPV717F or mutant PS1 (PSM146L-2) ( Fig. 5 , middle panel). The levels of oA? were correlated to the levels of monomeric A?42, i.e. the cell lines secreting elevated A?42 also had higher levels of oligomers in their media. We further examined the levels of total A? precipitated by antiserum 1282 but did not observe an elevation in total A? signal corresponding to those of A?42 and oA?. Thus, the amounts of total A? generated by cells expressing APPV717F or mutant PS1 (PSM146L-2) were comparable to those from the other cell lines ( Fig. 5 , bottom panel). Moreover, no oA? species were detected in these immunoprecipitates of total A?, suggesting that the oA? species made by the cells are principally composed of A?42. These results in well-defined cultured cell lines support our finding in human plasma that levels of oA? are closely associated with those of monomeric A?42. Declining plasma A?42 levels over 1–2 years The close association of monomeric A?42 and oA? levels suggests a dynamic conversion between these two A? species. To examine further the relationship of A?42 and oA? in vivo, we obtained sequential blood samples from a symptomatic FAD patient carrying a mutant PS1 gene. Blood samples were drawn at ages 58 and 60. A? levels were quantified by separate ELISAs for oA? and the four monomeric A? species ( Table 1 ). For oA? species, we observed a significant decrease, so that oA? was no longer detectable at age 60. For monomeric A?, the plasma concentrations of A?1–40 and A?x-40 were 48 and 84 pM, respectively, at age 58. The concentration of A?1–42 was 7 pM, and that of A?x-42 was 36 pM. The plasma A?42/A?total ratio was in the same range as those reported in patients carrying FAD-causing PS1 mutations 9 . Plasma samples collected 22 months later had significantly lower A? concentrations: the level of A?1–40 measured 36 pM (25% reduction), and A?1–42 was now undetectable ( Table 1 ). A?x-40 and A?x-42 declined to 48 pM (43% reduction) and 15 pM (58% reduction), respectively. Thus, while the levels of both A? species dropped over two years, A?42-ending species were reduced more dramatically than A?40-ending species. The complete loss of the A?1–42 and oA? signals is consistent with our findings above that the levels of these two species are closely associated. We also obtained sequential blood samples from a subset of our AD patients (n=12, including the FAD patient described above) and compared their A? levels over a 1–2 year span. All five A? species were again measured by ELISA, and the change in A? levels calculated. A similar number of subjects showed increased or decreased levels of A?1–40 over the course of 1–2 years ( Fig. 6A ), failing to show a clear temporal trend in A?1–40. Comparison of A?x-40 levels revealed 3 out of 11 subjects with an increased A?x-40 and the remaining 8 subjects had a reduced A?x-40 ( Fig. 6B ). In the 4 AD subjects with detectable plasma A?1–42 levels ( Fig. 6C ), three subjects showed a dramatic reduction in A?1–42 after one year, whereas one subject displayed almost identical levels of A?1–42 at both times. The latter subject also maintained similar levels of oA? after one year, whereas 3 AD subjects with detectable oA? levels had a reduction in relative plasma oA? ( Fig. 6E ). Thus, the drop of A?1–42 levels occurred in subjects who also showed a similar drop in oA? levels. Strikingly, all but one subject showed decreases in A?x-42 in the second plasma samples ( Fig. 6D ). Elevated levels of monomeric A?42 and oligomeric A? in brains of AD patients To investigate the association of monomeric A?42 and oA? directly in human brains, we obtained postmortem brain tissues from 9 AD cases and 7 age-matched control cases distinct from the subjects examined in the plasma A? studies above. We performed sequential extractions of brain tissues to obtain “soluble” (Tris-buffered saline (TBS)) and “insoluble” (Guanidine (Gu) HCl) extracts and measured their A? contents by ELISA. The soluble pool of brain A? extracted by TBS had relatively low levels of A?1–40 ( Fig. 7A ); an average of 1.1 pmol/g of A?1–40 was detected in the AD cases vs. 0.7 pmol/g in the controls (not statistically significant). The average level of TBS-soluble A?1–42 was significantly higher in AD than control cases ( Fig. 7B ). Likewise, the relative levels of TBS-soluble oA? were significantly higher in AD cases, as most control cases had almost undetectable levels of soluble oA? ( Fig. 7C ). After the extraction of soluble A? by TBS, the resultant pellets were further extracted in GuHCl to obtain the insoluble pools of A?. Overall, insoluble A?1–42 levels ( Fig. 7E ) were several hundred-fold higher than soluble A?1–42 levels ( Fig. 7B ), and they were almost ten fold higher than insoluble A?1–40 levels ( Fig. 7D ). This is consistent with numerous previous reports that amyloid deposits in AD brain are mainly composed of A?42. The levels of both insoluble A?1–40 and A?1–42 were significantly higher in brains from AD cases than those from control cases. Furthermore, a substantial and significant increase in the relative levels of insoluble oA? was observed in AD brains ( Fig. 7F ). Importantly, brain levels of insoluble A?1–42 were closely associated with the levels of oA? in both AD patients and control subjects (correlation coefficient, AD=0.88; ND=0.98). For example, one AD case (AD4) showed relatively low levels of A?1–42, and accordingly, its oA? level was low. Another control case (ND3) showed a relatively high level of A?1–42, corresponding to a high level of oA? ( Fig. 7F ). On average, significantly higher levels of all three insoluble A? species (A?1–40, A?1–42 and oA?) were found in AD brain tissues, compared to control cases ( Fig. 7 D–F ).  Establishing an oA?-specific ELISA To analyze oA? species in human samples, we established a sensitive and specific oA? ELISA. The assay relies on the use of a single monoclonal antibody for both capture and detection. Thus, for oA? to be detected by this sandwich ELISA, an A? assembly must contain at least two exposed copies of the same epitope that is accessible by the identical capturing and detecting antibody 27 , 28 . This means that this assay will recognize only A? assemblies that contain at least two A? molecules. Two monoclonal antibodies, 82E1 and 3D6 that each recognize the extreme N-terminus of human A?, were tested. To confirm the specificity of the ELISA, we utilized a synthetic A? peptide, A?1–40 Ser26Cys, that is capable of reversibly forming covalently cross-linked A? dimers (dA?) under oxidizing conditions 22 , 29 . Disulfide crossed-linked A? dimers were separated from unreacted monomer and higher aggregates by size exclusion chromatography. The concentration of dA? in stock solutions was determined by comparison to wild type (wt) synthetic A?1–40 of known concentration; both dA? and monomeric wt A? peptides were detected by SDS-PAGE and silver staining ( Fig. 1A ). Based on the densitometric signal obtained from synthetic wt A?1–40 peptide, we estimated that the concentration of our synthetic dA? stock was 81 uM. In the presence of 3% ?-mercaptoethanol (?ME), the disulfide bonds linking the monomers that form dA? were disrupted, producing a reduced monomer ( Fig. 1B ). In the absence of ?ME, no monomeric A? was detected, and the vast majority of A? species was dA? ( Fig. 1B ). Serial dilutions of dA? were made after the dA? stock was treated with or without ?ME, and the diluted samples were assayed using either antibody 82E1 ( Fig. 1C ) or 3D6 ( Fig. 1D ) in a sandwich format. When the relative levels of the diluted dA? (800 pM) of the dA? stock were normalized to 1, either monoclonal antibody detected a clear linear reduction in the levels of dA? when further diluted to 400 and 200 pM ( Fig. 1C ). In the presence of ?ME, dissociation of the disulfide bond markedly reduced the amount of dA? signal, and the levels of remaining dA? were less than 10% of the same fraction without ?ME, with 82E1 showing even greater specificity than 3D6 in this regard ( Fig. 1C, D ). Therefore, our new ELISA accurately measured the levels of dA? in a linear fashion and is highly sensitive to the dissociation of dA? to monomers.  Establishing an oA?-specific ELISA To analyze oA? species in human samples, we established a sensitive and specific oA? ELISA. The assay relies on the use of a single monoclonal antibody for both capture and detection.

In the presence of 3% ?-mercaptoethanol (?ME), the disulfide bonds linking the monomers that form dA? were disrupted, producing a reduced monomer ( Fig. 1B ).

Therefore, our new ELISA accurately measured the levels of dA? in a linear fashion and is highly sensitive to the dissociation of dA? to monomers.  Quantifying oligomeric plasma A? from AD patients Using the oA?-specific ELISA, we screened plasma samples obtained from 36 well-characterized AD patients and 10 control subjects. The ages of the AD subjects ranged from 50 to 90 at the time of blood sampling, with average age at 72. The age of control subjects ranged from 52 to 68, with average age at 62. Conventional A? ELISAs were applied to measure monomeric A? species. We analyzed plasma levels of oA? as a function of subject age but did not observe an age-dependent alteration of oA? levels ( Fig. 2 ). There were a number of subjects who carried high plasma levels of oA?-reactive species, with a wide age distribution between 60 and 90. Overall, we found that most (7/10) control subjects had plasma levels of oA? below our detection limit, whereas more than half (19/36) AD subjects had detectable oA? levels ( Fig. 2 ). From the same aliquot of plasma, we measured four monomeric A? species using four distinct ELISAs: A?1–40, A?1–42, and N-terminally heterogeneous A?40 and A?42 species (i.e., A?x-40 and A?x-42). The levels of A?1–40 and A?x-40 did not reveal a clear separation of AD subjects from control subjects ( Fig. 3A and B ). On average, the levels of A?x-40 were higher than those of A?1–40 (note scales on the ordinates of Figs. 3A and B ), indicating that a variable portion of plasma A?40 is N-terminally truncated. When the levels of A?x-42 ( Fig. 3C ) and A?1–42 ( Fig. 3D ) were analyzed from the same aliquots of plasma, we found that the levels of A?1–42 species were generally lower than those of A?1–40 species, and that the levels of A?x-42 were likewise lower than A?x-40 (compare Figs 3A, B to C, D ).  Quantifying oligomeric plasma A? from AD patients Using the oA?-specific ELISA, we screened plasma samples obtained from 36 well-characterized AD patients and 10 control subjects.

The levels of A?1–40 and A?x-40 did not reveal a clear separation of AD subjects from control subjects ( Fig. 3A and B ). On average, the levels of A?x-40 were higher than those of A?1–40 (note scales on the ordinates of Figs. 3A and B ), indicating that a variable portion of plasma A?40 is N-terminally truncated. When the levels of A?x-42 ( Fig. 3C ) and A?1–42 ( Fig. 3D ) were analyzed from the same aliquots of plasma, we found that the levels of A?1–42 species were generally lower than those of A?1–40 species, and that the levels of A?x-42 were likewise lower than A?x-40 (compare Figs 3A, B to C, D ).  Close association of levels of monomeric A? 42 and oligomeric A? in human plasma We calculated the average plasma A? levels for each of the four ELISAs in all AD and control subjects. Plasma levels of A? 40 and A?x-42 did not differ significantly between AD and controls ( Fig. 4A ). However, the average plasma levels of both A?1–42 and oA? were found to be significantly higher in AD subjects than controls ( Fig. 4A ). Furthermore, the relative levels of A?1–42 and oA? were closely associated. For this, we chose a threshold of 10 pM for A?1–42 (i.e., readily detectable above baseline) and identified 7 subjects that carried >10 pM levels of A?1–42 ( Fig. 4B ). Next, we identified 7 subjects that carried higher levels of oA? than the remaining subjects ( Fig. 4C ). We found that the subjects that carried >10 pM levels of A?1–42 ( Fig. 4B ) were the same subjects that carried high levels of oA? ( Fig. 4C ), and the relative levels of A?1–42 and oA? for each subject were tightly linked. Except for one patient who had the highest oA? level ( Fig. 4C , arrow) but had relative low A?1–42 ( Fig. 4B , arrow), our oA? ELISA clearly detected oA?-reactive species whose levels were tightly associated with those of monomeric A?1–42.  Close association of levels of monomeric A? 42 and oligomeric A? in human plasma We calculated the average plasma A? levels for each of the four ELISAs in all AD and control subjects. Plasma levels of A? 40 and A?x-42 did not differ significantly between AD and controls ( Fig. 4A ). However, the average plasma levels of both A?1–42 and oA? were found to be significantly higher in AD subjects than controls ( Fig. 4A ). Furthermore, the relative levels of A?1–42 and oA? were closely associated.

Next, we identified 7 subjects that carried higher levels of oA? than the remaining subjects ( Fig. 4C ). We found that the subjects that carried >10 pM levels of A?1–42 ( Fig. 4B ) were the same subjects that carried high levels of oA? ( Fig. 4C ), and the relative levels of A?1–42 and oA? for each subject were tightly linked. Except for one patient who had the highest oA? level ( Fig. 4C , arrow) but had relative low A?1–42 ( Fig. 4B , arrow), our oA? ELISA clearly detected oA?-reactive species whose levels were tightly associated with those of monomeric A?1–42.  Concomitant increases of monomeric and oligomeric A?42 in cultured cells To further validate the close association of monomeric A?42 with oA? detected by our oA? ELISA, we analyzed these A? species generated from cell lines expressing FAD-causing mutations in either APP or PS1. These cell lines have elevated A?42 monomer levels and secrete SDS-stable low-n A? oligomers into the media 25 , 30 , 31 . Similar to our AD and control cases that carry different levels of plasma A?, we have found variable levels of A? produced from multiple stable cell lines expressing wt or mutant (M146L or C410Y) PS1 and wt or mutant (V717F) APP. These lines were metabolically labeled with [35S]-Met, and the conditioned media were immunoprecipitated with antibody 21F12 (to A? ending at residue 42) or 1282 (a pan-A? polyclonal antibody) and analyzed by gel fluorography. Antibody 21F12 immunoprecipitated both monomeric A?42 and the p342 species (generated by sequential ?- and ?-secretase cleavages of APP) from the conditioned media of all cell lines. In media from APPV717F and PS1M146L-2 cells, additional A?42-immunoreactive bands migrating at ~5 kDa, 8–10 kDa and 12–14 kDa (collectively designated SDS-stable low-n oligomers) were also detected ( Fig. 5 , upper panel). Light exposure of blots separating A?42 monomer from oA? indicated that more A?42 was produced from cells expressing APPV717F or mutant PS1 (PSM146L-2) ( Fig. 5 , middle panel). The levels of oA? were correlated to the levels of monomeric A?42, i.e. the cell lines secreting elevated A?42 also had higher levels of oligomers in their media. We further examined the levels of total A? precipitated by antiserum 1282 but did not observe an elevation in total A? signal corresponding to those of A?42 and oA?. Thus, the amounts of total A? generated by cells expressing APPV717F or mutant PS1 (PSM146L-2) were comparable to those from the other cell lines ( Fig. 5 , bottom panel). Moreover, no oA? species were detected in these immunoprecipitates of total A?, suggesting that the oA? species made by the cells are principally composed of A?42. These results in well-defined cultured cell lines support our finding in human plasma that levels of oA? are closely associated with those of monomeric A?42.  Concomitant increases of monomeric and oligomeric A?42 in cultured cells To further validate the close association of monomeric A?42 with oA? detected by our oA?

These results in well-defined cultured cell lines support our finding in human plasma that levels of oA? are closely associated with those of monomeric A?42.  Declining plasma A?42 levels over 1–2 years The close association of monomeric A?42 and oA? levels suggests a dynamic conversion between these two A? species. To examine further the relationship of A?42 and oA? in vivo, we obtained sequential blood samples from a symptomatic FAD patient carrying a mutant PS1 gene. Blood samples were drawn at ages 58 and 60. A? levels were quantified by separate ELISAs for oA? and the four monomeric A? species ( Table 1 ). For oA? species, we observed a significant decrease, so that oA? was no longer detectable at age 60. For monomeric A?, the plasma concentrations of A?1–40 and A?x-40 were 48 and 84 pM, respectively, at age 58. The concentration of A?1–42 was 7 pM, and that of A?x-42 was 36 pM. The plasma A?42/A?total ratio was in the same range as those reported in patients carrying FAD-causing PS1 mutations 9 . Plasma samples collected 22 months later had significantly lower A? concentrations: the level of A?1–40 measured 36 pM (25% reduction), and A?1–42 was now undetectable ( Table 1 ). A?x-40 and A?x-42 declined to 48 pM (43% reduction) and 15 pM (58% reduction), respectively. Thus, while the levels of both A? species dropped over two years, A?42-ending species were reduced more dramatically than A?40-ending species. The complete loss of the A?1–42 and oA? signals is consistent with our findings above that the levels of these two species are closely associated. We also obtained sequential blood samples from a subset of our AD patients (n=12, including the FAD patient described above) and compared their A? levels over a 1–2 year span. All five A? species were again measured by ELISA, and the change in A? levels calculated. A similar number of subjects showed increased or decreased levels of A?1–40 over the course of 1–2 years ( Fig. 6A ), failing to show a clear temporal trend in A?1–40. Comparison of A?x-40 levels revealed 3 out of 11 subjects with an increased A?x-40 and the remaining 8 subjects had a reduced A?x-40 ( Fig. 6B ). In the 4 AD subjects with detectable plasma A?1–42 levels ( Fig. 6C ), three subjects showed a dramatic reduction in A?1–42 after one year, whereas one subject displayed almost identical levels of A?1–42 at both times. The latter subject also maintained similar levels of oA? after one year, whereas 3 AD subjects with detectable oA? levels had a reduction in relative plasma oA? ( Fig. 6E ). Thus, the drop of A?1–42 levels occurred in subjects who also showed a similar drop in oA? levels. Strikingly, all but one subject showed decreases in A?x-42 in the second plasma samples ( Fig. 6D ).  Declining plasma A?42 levels over 1–2 years The close association of monomeric A?42 and oA? levels suggests a dynamic conversion between these two A? species. To examine further the relationship of A?42 and oA? in vivo, we obtained sequential blood samples from a symptomatic FAD patient carrying a mutant PS1 gene. Blood samples were drawn at ages 58 and 60. A? levels were quantified by separate ELISAs for oA? and the four monomeric A? species ( Table 1 ). For oA? species, we observed a significant decrease, so that oA? was no longer detectable at age 60. For monomeric A?, the plasma concentrations of A?1–40 and A?x-40 were 48 and 84 pM, respectively, at age 58. The concentration of A?1–42 was 7 pM, and that of A?x-42 was 36 pM. The plasma A?42/A?total ratio was in the same range as those reported in patients carrying FAD-causing PS1 mutations 9 . Plasma samples collected 22 months later had significantly lower A? concentrations: the level of A?1–40 measured 36 pM (25% reduction), and A?1–42 was now undetectable ( Table 1 ). A?x-40 and A?x-42 declined to 48 pM (43% reduction) and 15 pM (58% reduction), respectively. Thus, while the levels of both A? species dropped over two years, A?42-ending species were reduced more dramatically than A?40-ending species. The complete loss of the A?1–42 and oA? signals is consistent with our findings above that the levels of these two species are closely associated. We also obtained sequential blood samples from a subset of our AD patients (n=12, including the FAD patient described above) and compared their A? levels over a 1–2 year span. All five A? species were again measured by ELISA, and the change in A? levels calculated. A similar number of subjects showed increased or decreased levels of A?1–40 over the course of 1–2 years ( Fig. 6A ), failing to show a clear temporal trend in A?1–40. Comparison of A?x-40 levels revealed 3 out of 11 subjects with an increased A?x-40 and the remaining 8 subjects had a reduced A?x-40 ( Fig. 6B ). In the 4 AD subjects with detectable plasma A?1–42 levels ( Fig. 6C ), three subjects showed a dramatic reduction in A?1–42 after one year, whereas one subject displayed almost identical levels of A?1–42 at both times. The latter subject also maintained similar levels of oA? after one year, whereas 3 AD subjects with detectable oA? levels had a reduction in relative plasma oA? ( Fig. 6E ). Thus, the drop of A?1–42 levels occurred in subjects who also showed a similar drop in oA? levels. Strikingly, all but one subject showed decreases in A?x-42 in the second plasma samples ( Fig. 6D ).  Elevated levels of monomeric A?42 and oligomeric A? in brains of AD patients To investigate the association of monomeric A?42 and oA? directly in human brains, we obtained postmortem brain tissues from 9 AD cases and 7 age-matched control cases distinct from the subjects examined in the plasma A? studies above. We performed sequential extractions of brain tissues to obtain “soluble” (Tris-buffered saline (TBS)) and “insoluble” (Guanidine (Gu) HCl) extracts and measured their A? contents by ELISA. The soluble pool of brain A? extracted by TBS had relatively low levels of A?1–40 ( Fig. 7A ); an average of 1.1 pmol/g of A?1–40 was detected in the AD cases vs. 0.7 pmol/g in the controls (not statistically significant). The average level of TBS-soluble A?1–42 was significantly higher in AD than control cases ( Fig. 7B ). Likewise, the relative levels of TBS-soluble oA? were significantly higher in AD cases, as most control cases had almost undetectable levels of soluble oA? ( Fig. 7C ). After the extraction of soluble A? by TBS, the resultant pellets were further extracted in GuHCl to obtain the insoluble pools of A?. Overall, insoluble A?1–42 levels ( Fig. 7E ) were several hundred-fold higher than soluble A?1–42 levels ( Fig. 7B ), and they were almost ten fold higher than insoluble A?1–40 levels ( Fig. 7D ). This is consistent with numerous previous reports that amyloid deposits in AD brain are mainly composed of A?42. The levels of both insoluble A?1–40 and A?1–42 were significantly higher in brains from AD cases than those from control cases. Furthermore, a substantial and significant increase in the relative levels of insoluble oA? was observed in AD brains ( Fig. 7F ). Importantly, brain levels of insoluble A?1–42 were closely associated with the levels of oA? in both AD patients and control subjects (correlation coefficient, AD=0.88; ND=0.98). For example, one AD case (AD4) showed relatively low levels of A?1–42, and accordingly, its oA? level was low. Another control case (ND3) showed a relatively high level of A?1–42, corresponding to a high level of oA? ( Fig. 7F ). On average, significantly higher levels of all three insoluble A? species (A?1–40, A?1–42 and oA?) were found in AD brain tissues, compared to control cases ( Fig. 7 D–F ).

On average, significantly higher levels of all three insoluble A? species (A?1–40, A?1–42 and oA?) were found in AD brain tissues, compared to control cases ( Fig. 7 D–F ).  Discussion Given the burgeoning evidence that small oligomeric assemblies of A? may be principally responsible for neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease, it is important to be able to specifically detect and quantify these species in a range of biological samples. Conventional approaches to measuring the levels of oA? have focused on semi-quantitative analysis by Western blotting or silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels. Recent advances in nanotechnology have enabled the measurement of sub-picomolar concentrations of oliogmers (also designated amyloid-? derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs)) in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 32 . For ELISA-based approaches, several groups have generated antibodies believed to be specific for aggregated A?. Among them, monoclonal antibody NAB61 specifically recognizes a complex conformational A?1–11 epitope on peroxynitrite- or UV light-treated synthetic A?, with much less reactivity for monomeric A?. Using NAB61 as a capture antibody and another A? antibody (BA27) as a reporter, this sandwich ELISA can differentiate UV crosslinked from monomeric synthetic A? with a relative sensitivity of 5:1 33 . Another antibody (158) recognizes 50–200 kDa protofibrillar aggregates of synthetic A? but not low molecular weight oligomers and monomers of synthetic A? 34 . In the current study, we oxidized synthetic A?1–40Ser26Cys peptide to generate disulfide crossed-linked dimers in order to test our new oA? ELISA. The A?1–40Ser26Cys dimer preparation was treated with GuHCl and therefore was free of any higher molecular weight aggregates ( Fig. 1B ). Subsequent separation of the stable dimers from un-crosslinked monomers was achieved by SEC. Detection of the synthetic dimers only in the absence of ?-mercaptoethanol clearly demonstrated the specificity of our oA? ELISA, with far less ability to detect monomers. Using this new oA? ELISA and previously established monomeric A? ELISAs, we obtained several lines of evidence for a close association between the levels of monomeric A?42 and oA? species in human plasma and brain tissue. First, the close association of A?1–42 and oA? was observed in a subset of AD patients who had readily detectable levels of plasma A?1–42 ( Fig. 4 ). The average levels of these two A? species were significantly higher in the AD than the control subjects. Indeed, only one of 10 control subjects even showed such readily detectable levels of A?1–42. Second, our studies of AD and control brain tissue showed the same pattern, i.e., levels of insoluble A?1–42 associated closely with the relative levels of insoluble oA? across individual cases ( Fig. 7 ). Third, among all AD and control cases that we examined, higher levels of oA? were not linked to lower levels of monomeric A?42, suggesting that the conversion of monomeric A? into oA? per se is not the major contributor to the observed reduction of monomeric A?42. Overall, our oA?-specific ELISA allowed us to establish a close quantitative relationship between the levels of A?1–42 and oA? in human plasma and brain tissues. This association was also observed in cultured cells expressing human APP. We found that the appearance of soluble oA? in the medium occurred exclusively in those clonal cell lines with significantly increased A?42 monomer production ( Fig. 5 ). FAD mutations in PS1 or APP lead to enhanced A?42 generation, and the occurrence of oA? is attributable to enhanced ?-secretase cleavage of APP at the 42nd residue of A?,which is facilitated by AD-causing mutations in either the substrate (APP) or the protease (PS1). Thus, levels of A?42 are closely associated with the formation of oA?. Our longitudinal comparisons of individual patients with AD provide new insight into the dynamic changes in plasma A? levels without the problem of inter-subject variation. Using monomeric A? and oA? ELISAs, we have provided two snap shots of A? levels within a relatively short period. Whereas we saw no clear directional change of A?1–40 levels, the remaining four A? species all showed a reduction in levels over the course of one to two years. About three quarters of cases showed a reduction in A?x-40. Among the cases with detectable plasma levels of A?1–42 and oA?, all but one case showed a decrease in A? levels. In the case of A?x-42, 9 patients showed a reduction over the 1–2 year period, while one case showed an increase. Importantly, the individuals with decreasing A?1–42 monomer levels were the same subjects who showed decreases in oA?. While our oA? ELISA provides an accurate method to measure such species in human blood, our results do not yet validate any one A? species as a biomarker for AD. Currently, the CSF tau/A?42 ratio has been the best predictor of the development of AD-type cognitive decline in still nondemented subjects 35 , 36 . Changes in the levels of tau and A?42 in CSF may reflect dysfunction in the cerebrum that can be measured by the EEG rhythm 37 , and low A?42 levels in CSF correlate well with positive PIB uptake by PET scanning 35 . Precise measurement of A? in plasma and CSF and subsequent correlation with levels in postmortem brain tissue should yield a clearer picture of A? metabolism in vivo. Mathematic modeling of the equilibrium between monomeric and oligomeric A? would also help elucidate the catabolic turnover of A? in the peripheral and central nervous systems 38 . Considering a wide range of factors that could contribute to variations in plasma A? levels, it is currently difficult to obtain a clear separation of AD from control subjects simply by measuring the levels of plasma A? species 39 . However, our findings suggest that measuring plasma A? and oA? over 1–2 years or more can reveal a significant reduction in plasma A?, especially A?42, and this finding raises the possibility of a direct relationship of plasma A? to brain amyloid formation.
