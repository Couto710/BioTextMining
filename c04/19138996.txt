HSP90 Inhibitors Suppress Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor-Mediated Activation of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 Transcription and DNA Adduct Formation The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a client protein of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), plays a significant role in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) induced carcinogenesis. Tobacco smoke, a source of PAHs, activates the AhR leading to enhanced transcription of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 , which encode proteins that convert PAHs to genotoxic metabolites. The main objectives of this study were to determine whether HSP90 inhibitors suppress PAH-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 or block benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) induced formation of DNA adducts. Treatment of cell lines derived from oral leukoplakia (MSK-Leuk1) or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (KYSE450) with a saline extract of tobacco smoke, B[a]P or dioxin induced CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 transcription resulting in enhanced levels of message and protein. Inhibitors of HSP90 (17-allylamino-demethoxygeldanamycin, 17-AAG; celastrol) suppressed these inductive effects of PAHs. Treatment with 17-AAG and celastrol also caused a rapid and marked decrease in amounts of AhR protein without modulating levels of HSP90. The formation of B[a]P induced DNA adducts in MSK-Leuk1 cells was inhibited by 17-AAG, celastrol and ?-naphthoflavone, a known AhR antagonist. The reduction in B[a]P induced DNA adducts was due, at least in part, to reduced metabolic activation of B[a]P. Collectively, these results suggest that 17-AAG and celastrol, inhibitors of HSP90, suppress the activation of AhR-dependent gene expression leading, in turn, to reduced formation of B[a]P induced DNA adducts. Inhibitors of HSP90 may have a role in chemoprevention in addition to cancer therapy.  Introduction The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated member of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors ( 1 ), binds with high affinity to the environmental toxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p -dioxin (TCDD or dioxin) ( 2 ). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in tobacco smoke, coal tar, automobile exhaust, wood smoke, and charbroiled food also bind to and activate the AhR. Most of the diverse biochemical, biological and toxicological responses caused by exposure to PAHs and polychlorinated dioxins are mediated, at least in part, by the AhR ( 3 ). The AhR is believed to be involved in the genotoxic actions of environmental carcinogens. The potential significance of the AhR in carcinogenesis is supported by recent studies of engineered mice. A constitutively active AhR expressed in transgenic mice induced tumors in the glandular stomach ( 4 ). Constitutive activation of AhR also renders mice more susceptible to carcinogens ( 5 ). Mice engineered to be AhR deficient were protected against benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) induced skin tumors ( 6 ). In the absence of ligand, the AhR is present in the cytosol as a component of a complex with a dimer of the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) ( 7 , 8 ), XAP2 ( 9 ), and p23 ( 10 , 11 ). Upon ligand binding, the AhR translocates into the nucleus ( 12 ) where it dissociates from its chaperone complex and forms a heterodimer with the AhR nuclear transporter (ARNT) ( 13 , 14 ). The AhR-ARNT dimer then binds to the upstream regulatory region of genes containing xenobiotic responsive elements (XRE) ( 13 , 14 ) resulting in the transcriptional activation of a network of genes encoding enzymes including CYP1A1 and CYPB1. Activation of AhR-mediated signaling leading to induction of xenobiotic metabolism can provide a first line of defense against certain toxic environmental carcinogens ( 15 ). However, the induction of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes by ligand-activated AhR can also increase the production of highly carcinogenic metabolites, creating a link between the AhR and chemical carcinogenesis. For example, B[a]P, a potent ligand of the AhR, induces its own metabolism to noncarcinogenic B[a]P phenols ( 16 ) and a toxic metabolite, anti-7,8-dihydroxy-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BPDE) ( 17 ), which covalently binds to DNA, forming bulky DNA adducts that induce mutations ( 18 ). It’s possible, therefore, that agents that suppress the activation of AhR signaling will possess chemopreventive properties. Inhibitors of HSP90 possess anti-cancer activity and are being extensively evaluated for the treatment of cancer ( 19 ). Synthetic HSP90 inhibitors including 17-allylamino-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), bind within the ATP binding pocket of the NH2-terminal domain of HSP90 ( 20 ), and thereby inhibit HSP90 activity. Recently, celastrol and gedunin ( Fig. 1 ), two natural products derived from plants of the Celastracae and Meliacae families, were found to inhibit HSP90 ( 21 ), albeit via a different mechanism than other known HSP90 inhibitors. Inhibition of HSP90 induces the degradation of a large number of client proteins with oncogenic properties. Although the AhR is a client protein of HSP90, little is known about whether 17-AAG, celastrol or gedunin can suppress the activation of AhR signaling or alter carcinogen metabolism. In the present study, we first determined that both synthetic and natural inhibitors of HSP90 suppressed tobacco smoke, B[a]P and dioxin-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 transcription. This appeared to reflect the ability of HSP90 inhibitors to induce the rapid degradation of the AhR. Importantly, inhibitors of HSP90 also suppressed the formation of B[a]P induced DNA adducts in a cellular model of oral leukoplakia. Taken together, these findings both strengthen the rationale of targeting AhR as a chemopreventive approach and suggest the potential use of HSP90 inhibitors for this purpose.

Cell culture MSK-Leuk1 cells were established from a pre-malignant dysplastic leukoplakia lesion adjacent to a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue ( 22 ). Cells were routinely maintained in KGM, grown to 60% confluency and trypsinized with 0.125% trypsin–2 mM EDTA solution. KYSE 450 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells ( 23 ) were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with low glucose, supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 ?g/mL streptomycin. In all experiments, cells were grown in basal medium for 24 h before treatment. Treatments were carried out in growth factor-free basal medium.  Preparation of tobacco smoke Cigarettes (2R4F, Kentucky Tobacco Research Institute) were smoked in a Borgwaldt piston-controlled apparatus (model RG-1) using the Federal Trade Commission standard protocol. Cigarettes were smoked one at a time in the apparatus and the smoke was drawn under sterile conditions into premeasured amounts of sterile PBS (pH 7.4). This smoke in PBS represents whole trapped mainstream smoke, abbreviated as TS. Quantitation of smoke content is expressed in puffs/mL of PBS with one cigarette yielding about 8 puffs drawn into a 5 mL volume. The final concentration of TS in the cell culture medium is expressed as puffs/mL medium. All treatments were carried out with 0.03 puffs/mL TS because this concentration of TS was previously found to induce CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 ( 24 , 25 ). As in our previous studies ( 24 , 25 ), TS was stored at ?80°C until use.  Western blot analysis Cell lysates were prepared by treating cells with lysis buffer (150 mmol/L NaCl, 100 mmol/L Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Tween 20, 50 mmol/L diethyldithiocarbamate, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ?g/mL aprotinin, 10 ?g/mL trypsin inhibitor and 10 ?g/mL leupeptin). Lysates were sonicated for 3 × 10 s on ice and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to sediment the particulate material. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by the method of Lowry ( 26 ). SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose sheets and then incubated with antisera to CYP1A1, CYP1B1, AhR, HSP90, XAP-2, p23, and ?-actin. Secondary antibody to immunoglobulin G conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used. The blots were then reacted with the ECL western blot detection system, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Analysis of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini-kit with on-column DNA digestion using RNase-free DNase according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using 1 ?g RNA per 50 ?L reaction. The reaction mixture contained 1× PCR Buffer II, 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 500 ?mol/L dNTPs, 50 U RNase inhibitor, 125 U MuLV reverse transcriptase and 2.5 ?mol/L random hexamers. Samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, then cycled at 42°C for 15 min and 95°C for 10 min. CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 expression was then determined by RT–PCR. An aliquot of 2 ?L of cDNA was subjected to 30 cycles of PCR in a 25 ?L reaction mixture (1× PCR Buffer II, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 400 ?mol/L dNTPs, 2.5 U Taq polymerase and upstream and downstream primers). Primers used were: CYP1A1, forward 5?-TCATGCTTTTCCCAATCTCC-3?, reverse 5?-CTCCTGCAACGTGCTTATCA-3?; CYP1B1, forward 5?-AACGTCATGAGTGCCGTGTGT-3?, reverse 5?-GGCCGGTACGTTCTCCAAATC-3?; ?-actin, forward 5?-GGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCAT-3?, reverse 5?-GGATGCCACAGGACTCCATGC-3?. Thermal cycling conditions were: 95°C for 2 min, followed by 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 62°C and 45 s at 72°C for 30 cycles and then 72°C for 10 min. Importantly, the signal for each product was linear with the amount of RNA analyzed. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. The identity of each PCR product was confirmed by direct sequencing.  Transient transfection MSK-Leuk1 cells were seeded at a density of 8 × 105 cells/well in 6-well dishes and grown to 60% confluence. In each well, cells were co-transfected with 1.8 ?g of the XRE luciferase plasmid pGudLuc6.1 (a gift of Dr Michael S. Denison, University of California at Davis) and 0.2 ?g of pSV?gal using LipoFECTAMINE 2000 as per the manufacturer’s instructions. After 6 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with basal medium, and the cells were allowed to grow for 24 h. The activities of luciferase and ?-galactosidase were measured in cellular extract.  Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay ChiP assay was performed with a kit (Upstate) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 2 × 106 cells were cross-linked in a 1% formaldehyde solution for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in 200 ?L of SDS buffer and sonicated to generate 200–1000-bp DNA fragments. After centrifugation, the cleared supernatant was diluted 10-fold with ChIP buffer and incubated with 1.5 ?g of the indicated antibody at 4°C. Immune complexes were precipitated, washed, and eluted as recommended. DNA-protein cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h, and the DNA fragments were purified and dissolved in 50 ?L of water. 10 ?L of each sample was used as a template for PCR amplification. CYP1A1 oligonucleotide sequences for PCR primers were forward 5?-ACCCGCCACCCTTCGACAGTTC-3? and reverse 5?-TGCCCAGGCGTTGCGTGAGAAG-3? ( 27 ). Forward and reverse primers used to amplify CYP1B1 were 5?-GTTCCCTTATAAAGGGAG-3? and 5?-CTGCGATGGAAGCCGTTG-3? ( 28 ). PCR was performed at 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 45 s for 30 cycles. The PCR products generated from the ChIP template were sequenced, and the identity of the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 promoters was confirmed.  DNA adducts and B[a]P-tetrols MSK-Leuk1 cells were grown to 50% confluence and placed in 10 mL KBM. Cells were pretreated with 17-AAG, celastrol, ?-napthoflavone or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) for 2 h. Subsequently, [3H]-B[a]P (G.E. Healthcare) was diluted to a specific activity of 12.8 Ci/mmol B[a]P with unlabeled B[a]P and added to a final concentration of 1 ?mol/L, resulting in a total amount of 128 ?Ci [3H]-B[a]P per dish. Twelve h later, cells were harvested, rinsed with PBS, and DNA was prepared using a Recoverase kit (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA was then extracted several times with water-saturated ethyl acetate until radioactivity was undetectable. The volume of the DNA solution was brought to 25 ?L, the pH adjusted to 1.0 with HCl and the solution was heated at 90° C for 3 h to release B[a]P-tetrols. To identify peaks containing radioactivity, the hydrolysate was spiked with markers of the B[a]P-tetrols produced by the spontaneous hydrolysis of ± anti-7,8, dihydroxy-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydo-B[a]P (Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repository, Midwest Research Institute). The tetrols, designated B[a]P-tetrol I-1 and I-2 are derived from the major adducts found in human DNA samples ( 29 ). After hydrolysis the DNA was applied to a 2×150 mm Nova-Pak C18 column and eluted isocratically using a Waters 501 pump at a flow rate of 0.15 mL/min with a mobile phase containing 24% acetonitrile and 10 mmol/L ammonium formate (pH 5.1). The eluate was monitored on a Hitachi F-1080 fluorescence detector using 325nm excitation and 400nm emission wavelengths. Fractions were collected every min and counted in a Packard 1600 TR liquid scintillation analyzer. To determine the concentration of DNA in each sample, an aliquot of the hydrolysate was applied to an Alltima HP C18 3? 2.1 × 150mm column (Alltech Associates) and the eluate monitored using a Waters 440 absorbance detector at 254 nm. The mobile phase was 1.5% acetonitrile in 50 mmol/L ammonium formate (pH 5.1), and the flow was 0.12 mL/min. The DNA concentration was calculated from the concentration of adenine in the hydrolysate. B[a]P tetrols in the media result from the spontaneous decomposition of BPDE, and were monitored by separating a fraction of the media containing nearly all of the radioactivity in B[a]P-tetrol I-1 and I-2. For this separation, 500 ?L of media was removed when the DNA isolation began and the media was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min to remove and cells or debris. The supernatant was extracted with ½ volume of methylene chloride, which removed B[a]P and other very hydrophobic solutes, but not the tetrols and contained 10–20% of the total radioactivity in the media. The aqueous layer was then extracted 2 × with 2 volumes of water saturated ethyl acetate, which extracted about 1/3 of the remaining radioactivity. Fluorescence assays for the internal standard demonstrated that about 95% of tetrols were extracted in ethyl acetate under these conditions. For several samples, an aliquot of the ethyl acetate fraction was injected onto the HPLC and analyzed as above. About 90% of the radioactivity was contained in the B[a]P-tetrol peaks.

Analysis of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini-kit with on-column DNA digestion using RNase-free DNase according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using 1 ?g RNA per 50 ?L reaction. The reaction mixture contained 1× PCR Buffer II, 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 500 ?mol/L dNTPs, 50 U RNase inhibitor, 125 U MuLV reverse transcriptase and 2.5 ?mol/L random hexamers. Samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, then cycled at 42°C for 15 min and 95°C for 10 min. CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 expression was then determined by RT–PCR. An aliquot of 2 ?L of cDNA was subjected to 30 cycles of PCR in a 25 ?L reaction mixture (1× PCR Buffer II, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 400 ?mol/L dNTPs, 2.5 U Taq polymerase and upstream and downstream primers). Primers used were: CYP1A1, forward 5?-TCATGCTTTTCCCAATCTCC-3?, reverse 5?-CTCCTGCAACGTGCTTATCA-3?; CYP1B1, forward 5?-AACGTCATGAGTGCCGTGTGT-3?, reverse 5?-GGCCGGTACGTTCTCCAAATC-3?; ?-actin, forward 5?-GGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCAT-3?, reverse 5?-GGATGCCACAGGACTCCATGC-3?. Thermal cycling conditions were: 95°C for 2 min, followed by 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 62°C and 45 s at 72°C for 30 cycles and then 72°C for 10 min. Importantly, the signal for each product was linear with the amount of RNA analyzed. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. The identity of each PCR product was confirmed by direct sequencing. Transient transfection MSK-Leuk1 cells were seeded at a density of 8 × 105 cells/well in 6-well dishes and grown to 60% confluence. In each well, cells were co-transfected with 1.8 ?g of the XRE luciferase plasmid pGudLuc6.1 (a gift of Dr Michael S. Denison, University of California at Davis) and 0.2 ?g of pSV?gal using LipoFECTAMINE 2000 as per the manufacturer’s instructions. After 6 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with basal medium, and the cells were allowed to grow for 24 h. The activities of luciferase and ?-galactosidase were measured in cellular extract. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay ChiP assay was performed with a kit (Upstate) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 2 × 106 cells were cross-linked in a 1% formaldehyde solution for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in 200 ?L of SDS buffer and sonicated to generate 200–1000-bp DNA fragments. After centrifugation, the cleared supernatant was diluted 10-fold with ChIP buffer and incubated with 1.5 ?g of the indicated antibody at 4°C. Immune complexes were precipitated, washed, and eluted as recommended. DNA-protein cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h, and the DNA fragments were purified and dissolved in 50 ?L of water. 10 ?L of each sample was used as a template for PCR amplification. CYP1A1 oligonucleotide sequences for PCR primers were forward 5?-ACCCGCCACCCTTCGACAGTTC-3? and reverse 5?-TGCCCAGGCGTTGCGTGAGAAG-3? ( 27 ). Forward and reverse primers used to amplify CYP1B1 were 5?-GTTCCCTTATAAAGGGAG-3? and 5?-CTGCGATGGAAGCCGTTG-3? ( 28 ). PCR was performed at 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 45 s for 30 cycles. The PCR products generated from the ChIP template were sequenced, and the identity of the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 promoters was confirmed. DNA adducts and B[a]P-tetrols MSK-Leuk1 cells were grown to 50% confluence and placed in 10 mL KBM. Cells were pretreated with 17-AAG, celastrol, ?-napthoflavone or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) for 2 h. Subsequently, [3H]-B[a]P (G.E. Healthcare) was diluted to a specific activity of 12.8 Ci/mmol B[a]P with unlabeled B[a]P and added to a final concentration of 1 ?mol/L, resulting in a total amount of 128 ?Ci [3H]-B[a]P per dish. Twelve h later, cells were harvested, rinsed with PBS, and DNA was prepared using a Recoverase kit (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA was then extracted several times with water-saturated ethyl acetate until radioactivity was undetectable. The volume of the DNA solution was brought to 25 ?L, the pH adjusted to 1.0 with HCl and the solution was heated at 90° C for 3 h to release B[a]P-tetrols. To identify peaks containing radioactivity, the hydrolysate was spiked with markers of the B[a]P-tetrols produced by the spontaneous hydrolysis of ± anti-7,8, dihydroxy-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydo-B[a]P (Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repository, Midwest Research Institute). The tetrols, designated B[a]P-tetrol I-1 and I-2 are derived from the major adducts found in human DNA samples ( 29 ). After hydrolysis the DNA was applied to a 2×150 mm Nova-Pak C18 column and eluted isocratically using a Waters 501 pump at a flow rate of 0.15 mL/min with a mobile phase containing 24% acetonitrile and 10 mmol/L ammonium formate (pH 5.1). The eluate was monitored on a Hitachi F-1080 fluorescence detector using 325nm excitation and 400nm emission wavelengths. Fractions were collected every min and counted in a Packard 1600 TR liquid scintillation analyzer. To determine the concentration of DNA in each sample, an aliquot of the hydrolysate was applied to an Alltima HP C18 3? 2.1 × 150mm column (Alltech Associates) and the eluate monitored using a Waters 440 absorbance detector at 254 nm. The mobile phase was 1.5% acetonitrile in 50 mmol/L ammonium formate (pH 5.1), and the flow was 0.12 mL/min. The DNA concentration was calculated from the concentration of adenine in the hydrolysate. B[a]P tetrols in the media result from the spontaneous decomposition of BPDE, and were monitored by separating a fraction of the media containing nearly all of the radioactivity in B[a]P-tetrol I-1 and I-2. For this separation, 500 ?L of media was removed when the DNA isolation began and the media was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min to remove and cells or debris. The supernatant was extracted with ½ volume of methylene chloride, which removed B[a]P and other very hydrophobic solutes, but not the tetrols and contained 10–20% of the total radioactivity in the media. The aqueous layer was then extracted 2 × with 2 volumes of water saturated ethyl acetate, which extracted about 1/3 of the remaining radioactivity. Fluorescence assays for the internal standard demonstrated that about 95% of tetrols were extracted in ethyl acetate under these conditions. For several samples, an aliquot of the ethyl acetate fraction was injected onto the HPLC and analyzed as above. About 90% of the radioactivity was contained in the B[a]P-tetrol peaks. Statistics Comparisons between groups were made by Student’s t test. A difference between groups of P< 0.05 was considered significant.  Statistics Comparisons between groups were made by Student’s t test. A difference between groups of P< 0.05 was considered significant.

Results HSP90 inhibitors suppress TS-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA and protein in MSK-Leuk1 and KYSE450 cells Initially, we evaluated whether either 17-AAG or the natural inhibitors (celastrol, gedunin) of HSP90 suppressed TS-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. Western blot analysis was carried out on lysates prepared from MSK-Leuk1 cells, a cell line that was established from an oral leukoplakia lesion. As shown in Figs. 2A and 2B , each of these HSP90 inhibitors caused concentration-dependent inhibition of TS-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. To confirm that these effects were not unique to MSK-Leuk1 cells, similar experiments were carried out in KYSE450 cells, a cell line derived from human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Once again, 17-AAG, celastrol and gedunin caused concentration-dependent inhibition of TS-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 ( Figs. 2A and B ). In both cell lines, 17-AAG was more potent than either celastrol or gedunin, with inhibitory effects found in the nanomolar range. Since the suppressive effects of celastrol and gedunin were comparable, we utilized celastrol in subsequent experiments. To determine if the suppressive effects of 17-AAG and celastrol were pre-translational, levels of mRNA were measured by RT-PCR. Consistent with the western blot results, both 17-AAG and celastrol inhibited TS-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 message ( Figs. 3A and B ). The HSP90 inhibitors exhibited a similar suppressive effect in both MSK-Leuk1 and KYSE450 cell lines. To complement the studies of TS, we also evaluated B[a]P and TCDD, prototypic ligands of the AhR. B[a]P is found in tobacco smoke and charbroiled food whereas TCDD is a potent environmental toxin. As shown in Figs. 4A and 4B , treatment of MSK-Leuk1 cells with either B[a]P or TCDD induced CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. Consistent with the TS findings, both 17-AAG and celastrol blocked B[a]P- and TCDD-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 ( Figs. 4A and 4B ). HSP90 inhibitors suppress the activation of AhR-dependent gene expression Experiments were next carried out to determine whether the HSP90 inhibitors blocked the induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 by suppressing transcription. Transient transfections were performed using an XRE-luciferase promoter construct. This promoter construct was selected because ligand activated AhR binds to XREs in the promoters of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 leading to increased transcription. Treatment with TS, B[a]P or TCDD led to a marked increase in XRE-luciferase activity, an effect that was suppressed by either 17-AAG or celastrol ( Figs. 5A and 5B ). To further evaluate effects on transcription, ChIP assays were performed. Protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to AhR, and bound DNA fragments were recovered and subjected to semiquantitative RT-PCR with oligonucleotides specific for the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 promoters. TS induced the binding of AhR to the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 promoters, an effect that was blocked by both 17-AAG and celastrol ( Figs. 5C–5F ). To investigate the mechanism by which HSP90 inhibitors blocked AhR ligand-mediated activation of gene expression, levels of proteins known to be involved in AhR signaling were determined. Treatment with concentrations of 17-AAG or celastrol that blocked the induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 led to a rapid and pronounced decrease in amounts of AhR protein ( Fig. 6A ). In contrast, HSP90 inhibitors did not affect the amounts of other proteins that are important for AhR signaling including HSP90, p23 and XAP-2 ( Fig. 6A ). B[a]P-induced DNA adduct formation is suppressed by HSP90 inhibitors Both CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 can metabolize PAHs including B[a]P into DNA reactive species that form adducts ( 30 , 31 ). The formation of adducts can, in turn, lead to mutations. Because HSP90 inhibitors blocked PAH-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, we postulated that 17-AAG and celastrol might suppress the formation of DNA adducts. For cells treated with 1 ?M B[a]P alone, the levels of B[a]P-adducts were in the range of 1 adduct/107 nucleotides on a mole basis. Both 17-AAG and celastrol inhibited B[a]P induced DNA adduct formation. 17-AAG, at 25 and 50 nmol/L, inhibited DNA adduct formation by approximately 65% and 90%, respectively (p<0.05) ( Fig. 6B ). Celastrol, at 0.5 and 1 ?mol/L, inhibited DNA adduct formation by approximately 50% and 75%, respectively (p<0.05) ( Fig. 6B ). ?-napthoflavone (1 ?mol/L), a known AhR antagonist, served as a positive control, and inhibited DNA adduct formation by more than 90% (p<0.01) (data not shown). The major pathway by which B[a]P is metabolized to a genotoxic metabolite involves its oxidation to BPDE. The epoxidation reactions are catalyzed by the cytochrome p450 mixed function oxidase system, with CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 playing a major role. BPDE is extremely reactive and undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis in aqueous media to B[a]P-tetrols. To determine if the observed suppression of DNA adducts mediated by HSP90 inhibitors reflected changes in B[a]P metabolism, levels of B[a]P-tetrols were measured in cell media. As shown in Fig. 6C , 25 and 50 nmol/L 17-AAG, inhibited B[a]P-tetrol formation by approximately 50% and 80%, respectively (p<0.05). Celastrol, at 0.5 and 1 ?mol/L, inhibited B[a]P-tetrol formation by approximately 50% and 62%, respectively (p<0.05) ( Fig. 6C ). Lastly, 1 ?mol/L ?-napthoflavone inhibited B[a]P-tetrol formation by approximately 75% (p<0.05) (data not shown). Taken together, HSP90 inhibitors appear to suppress the metabolic activation of B[a]P resulting in the suppression of B[a]P induced DNA adducts.

To further evaluate effects on transcription, ChIP assays were performed. Protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to AhR, and bound DNA fragments were recovered and subjected to semiquantitative RT-PCR with oligonucleotides specific for the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 promoters. TS induced the binding of AhR to the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 promoters, an effect that was blocked by both 17-AAG and celastrol ( Figs. 5C–5F ). To investigate the mechanism by which HSP90 inhibitors blocked AhR ligand-mediated activation of gene expression, levels of proteins known to be involved in AhR signaling were determined.

Both 17-AAG and celastrol inhibited B[a]P induced DNA adduct formation. 17-AAG, at 25 and 50 nmol/L, inhibited DNA adduct formation by approximately 65% and 90%, respectively (p<0.05) ( Fig. 6B ). Celastrol, at 0.5 and 1 ?mol/L, inhibited DNA adduct formation by approximately 50% and 75%, respectively (p<0.05) ( Fig. 6B ). ?-napthoflavone (1 ?mol/L), a known AhR antagonist, served as a positive control, and inhibited DNA adduct formation by more than 90% (p<0.01) (data not shown). The major pathway by which B[a]P is metabolized to a genotoxic metabolite involves its oxidation to BPDE. The epoxidation reactions are catalyzed by the cytochrome p450 mixed function oxidase system, with CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 playing a major role. BPDE is extremely reactive and undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis in aqueous media to B[a]P-tetrols. To determine if the observed suppression of DNA adducts mediated by HSP90 inhibitors reflected changes in B[a]P metabolism, levels of B[a]P-tetrols were measured in cell media. As shown in Fig. 6C , 25 and 50 nmol/L 17-AAG, inhibited B[a]P-tetrol formation by approximately 50% and 80%, respectively (p<0.05). Celastrol, at 0.5 and 1 ?mol/L, inhibited B[a]P-tetrol formation by approximately 50% and 62%, respectively (p<0.05) ( Fig. 6C ). Lastly, 1 ?mol/L ?-napthoflavone inhibited B[a]P-tetrol formation by approximately 75% (p<0.05) (data not shown). Taken together, HSP90 inhibitors appear to suppress the metabolic activation of B[a]P resulting in the suppression of B[a]P induced DNA adducts.  Discussion Although smoking cessation is optimal, it is not possible for everyone. Hence, developing strategies to reduce the procarcinogenic effects of PAHs remains a significant unmet need. As detailed above, multiple lines of evidence suggest that targeting the AhR is a potential pharmacological approach to reducing PAH induced cancer ( 32 ). In this study, we found that both synthetic and natural inhibitors of HSP90 suppressed amounts of the AhR, blocked PAH-mediated activation of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 transcription and reduced the formation of DNA adducts in B[a]P-treated cells. HSP90 is an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed molecular chaperone that modulates client protein folding and prevents the non-specific aggregation of misfolded or unfolded proteins. There are numerous client proteins of HSP90, including many whose deregulation has been linked to carcinogenesis, such as Bcr-Abl, mutated p53, ErbB2, Akt, Flt3, HIF-1? and B-Raf ( 33 , 34 ). Inhibitors of HSP90 suppress levels of numerous client proteins and are being actively investigated for the treatment of cancer ( 33 , 35 , 36 ). Here, we focused on using synthetic and natural inhibitors of HSP90 to disrupt the actions of AhR, another HSP90 client protein. Treatment with 17-AAG, a synthetic inhibitor of HSP90, led to a rapid decrease in amounts of the AhR. Consistent with this effect, 17-AAG also suppressed PAH-mediated activation of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 transcription leading to a marked reduction in levels of message and protein. These findings are consistent with prior evidence that geldanamycin, a benzoquinone ansamycin that directly associates with the ATP/ADP binding site of HSP90, suppressed levels of AhR and reduced dioxin-mediated induction of CYP1A1 ( 37 , 38 ). Little is known about the cellular targets of celastrol and gedunin but both possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Recently, a chemical genomic approach was used to identify these compounds as inhibitors of HSP90, albeit by a different mechanism than 17-AAG or geldanamycin ( 21 ). It was of interest, therefore, to evaluate whether these natural HSP90 inhibitors blocked the activation of AhR-dependent gene expression. Similar to 17-AAG, both celastrol and gedunin blocked TS-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 proteins. Because the magnitude of the suppressive effects of celastrol and gedunin were similar, additional mechanistic studies were only carried out with celastrol. Although less potent than 17-AAG, celastrol also caused a rapid decrease in amounts of AhR and suppressed PAH-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 transcription. Whether celastrol and gedunin, natural inhibitors of HSP90, offer any advantages over 17-AAG or related compounds is uncertain and deserves further study. The major pathway by which B[a]P is metabolized to a genotoxic metabolite involves its oxidation to BPDE. The epoxidation reactions are catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 mixed function oxidase system, with CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 playing a major role ( 30 , 31 ). BPDE is extremely reactive and spontaneously hydrolyzes in aqueous media to B[a]P-tetrols. A small fraction reacts with macromolecules, including DNA. The major site of adduction in mammalian systems is the exocyclic N2 position of guanine ( 39 ). Mispairing as a result of replication across the adducted guanine is thought to lead to mutations, and initiation of carcinogenesis ( 40 ). Agents that reduce the formation of BPDE inhibit the formation of DNA adducts and production of B[a]P-tetrols. Here we show that HSP90 inhibitors suppress the formation of both products. As B[a]P is stable in cell medium in the absence of cells, B[a]P-tetrols in the media result from intracellular metabolism of B[a]P and simple diffusion into the medium. The amount of total radioactivity in the medium represented only about 20% of the input radioactivity, presumably because most of the B[a]P and its metabolites were sequestered within the cells. There was good concordance between the effects of inhibitors on levels of B[a]P-tetrols in the media and adducts in the DNA. This suggests that levels of B[a]P-tetrols in the media serve as markers for cellular metabolism of B[a]P to BPDE. Collectively, our results suggest that 17-AAG and celastrol block PAH-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 resulting in reduced B[a]P metabolism and DNA adduct formation. An alternative explanation such as the induction of DNA repair activity by 17-AAG or celastrol would not explain the strong reduction in levels of B[a]P-tetrols found in the media following treatment of cells with HSP90 inhibitors. At first glance, it appears predictable that suppressing the induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, carcinogen activating enzymes, should reduce the formation of DNA adducts and inhibit carcinogenesis. However, several lines of evidence suggest that this may not be the case in vivo . Pretreatment of rats with PAH results in reduced tissue levels of orally administered B[a]P because of enhanced metabolism ( 41 ). Moreover, studies with CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 knockout mice have suggested that these proteins protect against B[a]P toxicity because in their absence, levels of DNA adducts are higher ( 42 – 44 ). Finally, some but not all models of PAH induced carcinogenesis suggest that activation of AhR signaling may protect against the carcinogenic effects of PAH ( 15 ). The balance between tissue-specific expression of the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 enzymes may regulate sensitivity to B[a]P toxicity and perhaps carcinogenicity ( 44 ). In addition to suppressing PAH-mediated induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, inhibitors of HSP90 have multiple other effects. It is predictable, for example, that HSP90 inhibitors will down-regulate levels of multiple client proteins and suppress the induction of other AhR-dependent genes. Given the potential limitations of our in vitro findings, additional preclinical studies involving animal models will be needed to determine whether HSP90 inhibitors suppress PAH induced DNA adduct formation, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. If inhibiting HSP90 reduces the development of PAH induced malignancies in preclinical models, it will be important to consider clinical scenarios in which these agents might be used. Elevated levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 are detected in the upper aerodigestive tracts of smokers ( 24 , 25 , 45 ). Patients with a history of head and neck cancer who continue to smoke are at increased risk for second primary tumors ( 46 ). Whether administering inhibitors of HSP90 will reduce the risk of second primaries in this patient population could be evaluated. In this context, the possibility of administering HSP90 inhibitors topically as a rinse or lozenge to reduce toxicity should be considered. Certainly, this approach would minimize the theoretical concern that HSP90 inhibitors might increase PAH induced DNA adduct formation in internal organs ( 41 – 44 ). Our findings have other potential clinical implications. In addition to being able to activate carcinogens, CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 play a role in the metabolism and clearance of a variety of drugs including anticancer agents ( 47 , 48 ), as well as many xenobiotics and endogenous substrates ( 48 ). It’s possible, therefore, that inhibitors of HSP90 will affect the metabolism and clearance of other therapeutic drugs, which could impact upon both their efficacy and toxicity. Similarly, the metabolism and clearance of xenobiotics and endogenous substrates could be affected ( 48 ). In future studies of HSP90 inhibitors, our findings suggest that it will be important to monitor blood levels of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by enzymes encoded by AhR-dependent genes.
