Pseudoxanthoma elasticum: Clinical phenotypes, molecular genetics and putative pathomechanisms Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a prototype of heritable multi-system disorders, is characterized by pathologic mineralization of connective tissues, with primary clinical manifestations in the skin, eyes and the cardiovascular system. The causative gene was initially identified as ABCC6 which encodes an ABC transporter protein (ABCC6) expressed primarily in the liver and the kidneys. The critical role of ABCC6 in ectopic mineralization has been confirmed by the development of Abcc6 -/- knock-out mice which recapitulate the features of connective tissue mineralization characteristic of PXE. Over 200 distinct loss-of-function mutations representative of over 1000 mutant alleles in ABCC6 have been identified by streamlined mutation detection strategies in this autosomal recessive disease. More recently, missense mutations in the GGCX gene, either in compound heterozygous state or digenic with a recurrent ABCC6 nonsense mutation (p.R1141X), have been identified in patients with PXE-like cutaneous findings and vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor deficiency. GGCX encodes a carboxylase which catalyzes ?-glutamyl carboxylation of coagulation factors as well as of matrix gla protein (MGP) which in fully carboxylated form serves as a systemic inhibitor of pathologic mineralization. Collectively, these observations suggest the hypothesis that a consequence of loss-of-function mutations in the ABCC6 gene is the reduced vitamin K-dependent ?-glutamyl carboxylation of MGP, with subsequent connective tissue mineralization. Further progress in understanding the detailed pathomechanisms of PXE should provide novel strategies to counteract, and perhaps cure, this complex heritable disorder at the genome-environment interface.
