Unusual Sites of Extraskeletal Metastases of Ewing Sarcoma after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for solid tumors remains under investigation. We report a case of extended disease stability after a non-myeloablative peripheral blood SCT for metastatic, refractory Ewing sarcoma. Of note, the patient developed metastatic disease to two unusual sites â€“ the brain and small intestine. The allogeneic SCT environment may alter typical metastatic patterns, and may represent an ideal platform to manipulate and enhance the anti-tumor immune response. Further clinical trials are needed to evaluate the role for allogeneic SCT for this disease.
