Fertility drug use and mammographic breast density in a mammography screening cohort of premenopausal women The widespread use of ovulation-inducing drugs to enhance fertility has raised concerns regarding potential effects on breast cancer risk, as ovarian stimulation is associated with increases in estrogen and progesterone levels. We investigated the short-term relation between fertility drug use and mammographic breast density, a strong marker of breast cancer risk, among participants in the Group Health Breast Cancer Screening Program. Data linkage with Group Health’s automated pharmacy records identified 104 premenopausal women under 50 years old who obtained a mammogram during 1996-2006, within 2 years after a fertility drug dispensing. Premenopausal non-users of fertility drugs were matched to users by age, body mass index, age at first birth, family history of breast cancer, past use of birth control hormones, race, and education (N=1005). All mammograms were categorized for density according to the Breast Imaging Reporting Data System™ as entirely fat, scattered fibroglandular, heterogeneously dense, or extremely dense. Density in fertility drug users was equally likely as in non-users to be rated entirely fat (OR=0.83; 95% CI:0.18-3.71), heterogeneously dense (OR=1.09; 95% CI:0.64-1.85), or extremely dense (OR=0.93; 95% CI:0.48-1.78) compared to scattered fibroglandular. In analyses restricted to fertility drug users, each additional month after the date of dispensing was associated with a 13% (95% CI for the OR:1.01-1.27) increased odds of being categorized as heterogeneously/extremely dense compared to entirely fat/scattered fibroglandular ( p =0.04). Our results indicate no overall association between fertility drug use and mammographic density, but provide evidence that density may be lower in women more recently dispensed a fertility drug.  Introduction In the United States, approximately 7-10% of women aged 15-44 years old - approximately 6 million women - report some form of infertility problem ( 1 ). Consequently, use of fertility drugs is widespread, with prescriptions increasing almost two-fold between 1973 and 1991 ( 2 ). As ovulation deficiency is the most common cause of female infertility ( 3 , 4 ), initial treatment is often based on hormonal therapy that stimulates egg development and release. This stimulation results in the proliferation of ovarian cells and up to five-fold increases in serum estrogen and progesterone concentrations ( 5 - 7 ). These effects have raised concern about the potential for fertility drugs to influence breast cancer risk, as risk of breast cancer is known to increase with exposure to endogenous and exogenous female hormones, and with lifetime number of ovulatory cycles ( 8 - 10 ). A number of studies have examined fertility drug use in relation to breast cancer risk (reviewed in ( 11 )). A few studies have suggested possible risk increases ( 12 , 13 ) or decreases ( 14 , 15 ) with fertility drug use, while other studies have reported no association with risk of breast cancer ( 16 - 18 ). Most studies are limited by small numbers of cancers among fertility drug users, self-reported exposure assessment, and an incomplete ability to control for potentially confounding factors associated with fertility drug use such as nulliparity and late age at first birth. Mammographic breast density is a useful marker for breast cancer risk ( 19 ). Mammographic breast density refers to the radiologic appearance of breast tissue on a mammogram, and is determined by the relative amounts of radiodense epithelial and stromal tissue compared to radiolucent fat tissue. Breast density is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer, with risk more than four times greater in women with density in more than 75% of the breast compared to women with less than 5% density ( 20 ). Breast density is associated with known breast cancer risk factors such as postmenopausal hormone use ( 21 ) and reproductive and menstrual factors ( 22 , 23 ). We hypothesized that if fertility drug use were to increase breast cancer risk, particularly via a promoter effect, then mammographic density would be elevated in women shortly after use of fertility drugs. We tested this hypothesis among participants in the Group Health Breast Cancer Screening Program (BCSP).  Methods Study population Group Health Cooperative, an integrated group practice in Washington State with approximately 550,000 members, has a population-based Breast Cancer Screening Program (BCSP) that women are invited to join at age 40 or when they join Group Health, if older than age 40 ( 24 , 25 ). This study was conducted with data from Group Health’s BCSP, which administers a risk factor survey to participants when they join the BCSP and at each mammogram, and tracks mammography results. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Group Health and the University of Wisconsin. A waiver of consent was obtained for all women entering the Group Health mammography clinic to allow for linkage of data. Participants in the BCSP were linked to data from Group Health’s automated pharmacy dispensing records, which includes medication filled within Group Health pharmacies and outside pharmacy fills where there has been a claim for Group Health to pay for the medication. We identified women with at least one dispensing of a fertility drug and a screening mammogram completed within 24 months after that dispensing between January 1, 1996 and January 31, 2006. Eligibility was restricted to premenopausal women under 50 years old at the time of the mammogram. We excluded women who reported using oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy at the time of their mammogram. We also excluded women if they reported ever using raloxifene or tamoxifen, or if they had a history of breast cancer, breast augmentation or breast reduction. After excluding two users due to missing age information, 104 users were identified for analysis. Non-users were identified as premenopausal women with at least one screening mammogram between January 1, 1996 and January 31, 2006, under 50 years old at the time of the mammogram, with no record of fertility drug dispensing. The same exclusion criteria were applied as for fertility drug users. Non-users were matched 10:1 to fertility drug users, based on age at the time of the mammogram (33-40, 41-44, 45-49 years), self-reported body mass index (BMI; tertiles: <24.0, 24.0-27.9, ?28.0, unknown), age at first birth (nulliparous, <25, 25-34, ?35, unknown), use of birth control hormones (ever, never/unknown), first degree family history of breast cancer (yes, no/unknown), race (Asian, not Asian/unknown), and education (college graduate, less than college graduate/unknown). These variables were chosen a priori on the basis of their potential association with mammographic density. Age at menarche and number of children were not available for matching, as these variables were not included on the first version of the breast cancer risk factor questionnaire (administered during 1996-2001) and thus over 70% of participants were missing these data. Seven users could not be matched with 10 non-users each, and thus were matched to fewer non-users (range: 2-8). After matching, 1005 non-users were available for analysis. Data collection Information was collected from Group Health’s automated pharmacy records on dispensings of clomiphenes and gonadotropins. For women with a fertility drug dispensing, data from the first mammogram completed after the dispensing was used (median 11.1 months between drug dispensing and mammogram, range = 0.2-23.8 months). All mammograms completed at Group Health are interpreted by the clinical radiologist for mammographic breast density according to the Breast Imaging Reporting Data System™ (BI-RADS™: 1=entirely fat, 2=scattered fibroglandular, 3=heterogeneously dense, 4=extremely dense) ( 26 ). Self-reported demographic and risk factor information were collected via a self-administered questionnaire at the time of the mammogram. Statistical Analysis We used the chi-square test for univariate comparisons of the mammographic density distribution among matched users and non-users of fertility drugs. Conditional logistic regression, stratified on the matching variables, was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) describing the relation between fertility drug use and categorical BI-RADS™ density. We also categorized breasts as low density (entirely fat or scattered fibroglandular) or high density (heterogeneously or extremely dense) ( 27 ). Separate logistic regression analyses of the relation between breast density and fertility drug use were performed with mammographic density grouped as low density vs. high density. To evaluate the effect of timing of the mammogram in relation to drug dispensing, we conducted a logistic regression of the grouped density variable (low vs. high density) on time between dispensing and mammogram among fertility drug users only, while adjusting for each of the variables used in matching. Least squared means and p -values for comparing time between dispensing and mammogram among different density categories were calculated using multivariable analysis of variance.  Study population Group Health Cooperative, an integrated group practice in Washington State with approximately 550,000 members, has a population-based Breast Cancer Screening Program (BCSP) that women are invited to join at age 40 or when they join Group Health, if older than age 40 ( 24 , 25 ).

Conditional logistic regression, stratified on the matching variables, was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) describing the relation between fertility drug use and categorical BI-RADS™ density. We also categorized breasts as low density (entirely fat or scattered fibroglandular) or high density (heterogeneously or extremely dense) ( 27 ). Separate logistic regression analyses of the relation between breast density and fertility drug use were performed with mammographic density grouped as low density vs. high density. To evaluate the effect of timing of the mammogram in relation to drug dispensing, we conducted a logistic regression of the grouped density variable (low vs. high density) on time between dispensing and mammogram among fertility drug users only, while adjusting for each of the variables used in matching. Least squared means and p -values for comparing time between dispensing and mammogram among different density categories were calculated using multivariable analysis of variance.  Results The characteristics of study participants are described in Table 1 . Among users of fertility drugs, 99 (95.2%) used clomiphene and 5 (4.8%) used gonadotropins. The mean time between the dispensing date and the mammogram for users of fertility drugs was 11.5 months (SD = 7.5, range = 0.2-23.8 months). Among non-users, women with a mammogram categorized as high density had a lower BMI (mean = 24.9, SD = 6.5 kg/m2) and were more likely to be nulliparous (51.4%) than women with a mammogram categorized as low density (mean BMI = 31.3, SD = 7.5 kg/m2; 44.7% nulliparous). Mammographic density was distributed similarly in users and non-users of fertility drugs ( Table 2 ; Chi-square p = 0.95 for BI-RADS™ categories). No statistically significant differences were observed between fertility drug users and non-users in the odds of having entirely fat, heterogeneously dense, or extremely dense mammograms relative to scattered fibroglandular ( Table 2 ). There remained no difference between users and non-users when density was treated as a grouped variable (low vs. high density), in analyses restricted to women dispensed fertility drugs within a year of their mammogram, or in analyses restricted to nulliparous women ( Table 2 ). Of the 51 fertility drug users who were nulliparous, 30 (58.8%) were dispensed the drug within 1 year before their mammogram. Additionally, the relation between fertility drug use and breast density was not substantially changed after exclusion of four fertility drug users (and their matched controls) who were dispensed a drug within 1 month of their mammogram (OR=1.01; 95% CI: 0.60-1.69 for high vs. low density). Among users of fertility drugs, each additional month between the date of dispensing and the mammogram was associated with a 13% (95% CI for OR: 1.01, 1.27; multivariable adjusted) increased odds of being categorized as high density compared to low density ( p = 0.04). Women whose mammogram was a year or later after drug dispensing were 6.13 (95% CI: 0.99-37.86; multivariable adjusted) times as likely to be categorized as high density compared to women whose mammogram was less than a year after drug dispensing (p=0.05). When stratified by density category, fertility drug users in successively lower density categories tended to have had their mammogram more promptly after drug dispensing ( Figure 1 ; multivariable-adjusted p -trend = 0.04). After multivariable adjustment, users categorized as entirely fat or scattered fibroglandular averaged 7.3 months from dispensing to mammogram, compared to 12.8 months for heterogeneously dense and 14.1 months for extremely dense. All results were not substantially changed when users of gonadotropins were excluded or when the analyses were further adjusted for days since last menstrual period at the time of each woman’s mammogram.  Results The characteristics of study participants are described in Table 1 . Among users of fertility drugs, 99 (95.2%) used clomiphene and 5 (4.8%) used gonadotropins. The mean time between the dispensing date and the mammogram for users of fertility drugs was 11.5 months (SD = 7.5, range = 0.2-23.8 months). Among non-users, women with a mammogram categorized as high density had a lower BMI (mean = 24.9, SD = 6.5 kg/m2) and were more likely to be nulliparous (51.4%) than women with a mammogram categorized as low density (mean BMI = 31.3, SD = 7.5 kg/m2; 44.7% nulliparous). Mammographic density was distributed similarly in users and non-users of fertility drugs ( Table 2 ; Chi-square p = 0.95 for BI-RADS™ categories). No statistically significant differences were observed between fertility drug users and non-users in the odds of having entirely fat, heterogeneously dense, or extremely dense mammograms relative to scattered fibroglandular ( Table 2 ). There remained no difference between users and non-users when density was treated as a grouped variable (low vs. high density), in analyses restricted to women dispensed fertility drugs within a year of their mammogram, or in analyses restricted to nulliparous women ( Table 2 ).

All results were not substantially changed when users of gonadotropins were excluded or when the analyses were further adjusted for days since last menstrual period at the time of each woman’s mammogram.  Discussion The results of this study suggest no overall association between fertility drug use and mammographic breast density. Mammographic density was distributed similarly in users of fertility drugs and matched non-users. Though power was limited to explore timing effects, there was some suggestion that breast density may be lower in women who were more recently prescribed a fertility drug. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the relation between fertility drug use and mammographic density. The results are consistent with most studies suggesting no relation between fertility drug use and breast cancer risk overall ( 11 ). Few epidemiologic studies have evaluated breast cancer risk in relation to the timing of fertility drug use. In a study of women undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment, Venn et al. ( 28 ) reported an increase in breast cancer risk (compared to the general population) during the first year following fertility drug use. The authors speculated that the increased serum estradiol concentrations associated with fertility drug use - approximately five times normal ( 7 ) - may promote the development of pre-existing cancers. In contrast, Brinton et al. ( 29 ) found that breast cancer risk was elevated among fertility drug users only after 20 years of follow-up. Interestingly, two studies have reported a decrease in breast risk cancer risk among fertility drug users. In a recent analysis of the Nurses Health Study II, Terry et al. ( 15 ) found that compared to women reporting no problems conceiving, breast cancer risk was reduced among women with infertility due to an ovulatory disorder but there was no relation between breast cancer risk and infertility due to other reasons. Risk was further reduced among infertile women who received ovulation induction therapy. These trends were similar in both parous and nulliparous women. Similarly, Rossing et al. ( 14 ) reported that women who had taken clomiphene were at a reduced risk of breast cancer compared to infertile women who had not used the drug. As is common to many studies of fertility drug use, it is difficult for us to distinguish between the effects of fertility drug use and infertility itself. We were unable to compare mammographic density in fertility drug users to that of infertile women who did not use fertility drugs. Differences in density between users and non-users could be attributed to the underlying cause of infertility. Further we had no information regarding the cause of infertility among drug users. The pathologies related to female infertility vary widely in their association with altered hormone levels and thus their potential to influence breast density. However, these limitations would not explain the relation observed between density and time since drug dispensing among fertility drug users. Additionally, we were able to control for potentially confounding factors, such as age at first birth and education, which are associated with both fertility drug use and breast density. A screening mammogram is not a routine component of fertility treatment. During the period of this study, national guidelines for the general population recommended a screening mammogram every 1-2 years for women ages 40 and older ( 30 , 31 ). In the Group Health BCSP, screening was recommended every 1-3 years for all women ?50 years old, and for the ?50% of women ages 40-49 years old with commonly recognized breast cancer risk factors. All women in the BCSP could get a screening mammogram, even if it was not recommended. 87% of the women in our study were 40 years old or older. All participants in the study received a screening mammogram. Women receiving a diagnostic mammogram for the investigation of a breast lump or other abnormality were not included in the study. As screening mammography is not recommended for women under the age of 40 years, fertility drug users are in general not a heavily screened population and thus repeated density measurements are scarce for retrospective observational studies. However, we found that women more recently dispensed a fertility drug were more likely to have mammograms with less density. It is possible the relation we observed between density and time since drug dispensation could be confounded by the success (or lack thereof) of the fertility drug in promoting pregnancy. Women with a longer period between fertility drug use and their mammogram may have been more likely to have had a recent pregnancy, which may influence their breast density. Unfortunately we did not have data on pregnancy outcomes associated with the fertility drug use, beyond whether or not each participant had ever given birth at the time of the mammogram. The relation between density and time since dispensing was not attenuated among women who remained nulliparous (OR = 1.84 for high density vs. low density for each additional month between drug dispensing and mammogram; 95% CI: 0.57-5.88). Alternatively, women with a mammogram more distant in time from the dispensing of the fertility drug may have had more repeated use of fertility drugs during the time interval. Thus, the association between the time interval and density could possibly reflect a dose effect. Rossing ( 14 ) and Terry ( 15 ) have proposed that clomiphene may reduce breast cancer risk through its anti-estrogenic effects. Like tamoxifen, clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator ( 5 , 32 ). Clomiphene inhibits cellular proliferation of breast cancer cells ( 33 ) and inhibits mammary gland development in rats ( 34 ). Furthermore, clomiphene demonstrated anti-tumor activity in an early clinical trial for the treatment of advanced breast cancer ( 35 ). Thus, the local anti-estrogenic effects of clomiphene on breast tissue may reduce proliferation despite the associated increases in estrogen and progesterone levels. This type of effect on mammographic breast density could begin within days of drug use, as it would be independent of ovulation, which may not occur until weeks after the initiation of drug use. This mechanism would be consistent with our observation of lower density in women more recently dispensed a fertility drug. Older women and those who are obese may require more repeated fertility drug treatments to induce ovulation. However, we found that the relation between breast density and time since drug dispensing among fertility drug users did not differ substantially according to BMI or age. The odds of being categorized as high density compared to low density was increased by 14% (95% CI for OR: 0.95, 1.37) for each additional month between the date of dispensing and the mammogram among fertility drug users with BMI<30 kg/m2, and increased by 18% (95% CI for OR: 0.95, 1.47) among users who were 41 years old (median age) or younger (compared with 13% increase overall among all fertility drug users). Our precision was limited by a small number of fertility drug users. We had 80% power to detect ORs of 3.8, 2.3, and 2.5 for entirely fat, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense mammograms, respectively, compared to the scattered fibroglandular reference category. With density grouped into two categories (low vs. high density) we had 80% power to detect an OR of 2.2. Studies with a larger number of fertility drug users are necessary to further explore the relation with mammographic density. Additional precision could be gained by using a continuous measure of mammographic breast density and repeated breast density measures in the same women ( 19 ). Rather than relying on self-reports, we gathered drug use information from medical records. However, the data was limited to a date of dispensing. We did not have data on when or if fertility drug use was actually initiated, dose information, or the duration of use. Such exposure misclassification could be expected to bias our results towards a null finding. In conclusion, our results suggest no overall association between fertility drug use and mammographic density, but provide some evidence breast density may be lower in women who were more recently dispensed a fertility drug prior to their mammogram. Future studies of the effects of fertility drug use on breast tissue may benefit from the further use of mammographic density as a marker of breast cancer risk.

We did not have data on when or if fertility drug use was actually initiated, dose information, or the duration of use. Such exposure misclassification could be expected to bias our results towards a null finding. In conclusion, our results suggest no overall association between fertility drug use and mammographic density, but provide some evidence breast density may be lower in women who were more recently dispensed a fertility drug prior to their mammogram. Future studies of the effects of fertility drug use on breast tissue may benefit from the further use of mammographic density as a marker of breast cancer risk.  Figure and Tables Figure 1 Mean time since fertility drug dispensing among fertility drug users, according to mammographic density Error bars represent standard errors. Women with mammograms rated as entirely fat (N=2) and scattered fibroglandular (N=24) were combined. Adjusted for age, body mass index, age at first birth, first degree family history of breast cancer, use of birth control hormones, race, and education. p -trend = 0.04.
