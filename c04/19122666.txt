Collagen VI protects neurons against A? toxicity Amyloid-? (A?) peptides, widely presumed to cause Alzheimer’s disease, increased mouse neuronal expression of collagen VI through a mechanism involving transforming growth factor signaling. Reduction of collagen VI augmented A? neurotoxicity, whereas treatment of neurons with soluble collagen VI blocked the association of A? oligomers with neurons, enhanced A? aggregation and prevented neurotoxicity. These results identify collagen VI as an important component of the neuronal injury response and demonstrate its neuroprotective potential.  Introduction Amyloid-? (A?) peptides are important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. They are derived from amyloid precursor proteins (APP) and can self-aggregate into fibrillar and nonfibrillar structures. In transgenic mice with neuronal expression of familial Alzheimer’s disease–mutant human APP (hAPP) and high A? levels, memory deficits and neuronal dysfunction are most directly related to soluble A?1–42 (A?42) oligomers 1 . Many molecular alterations that correlate with memory deficits in these models are most prominent in the dentate gyrus, which is critical for learning and memory and shows early synaptic deficits in Alzheimer’s disease 2 . We profiled A?-induced gene-expression changes in the dentate gyrus of hAPP transgenic mice and nontransgenic controls by DNA microarray analysis. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, San Francisco. Expression of mRNA encoding the ?1 subunit of collagen VI ( Col6a1 ) was markedly increased in hAPP mice (data not shown). Collagen VI is a large triple-helix extracellular matrix (ECM) protein consisting of ?1(VI), ?2(VI) and ?3(VI) subunits. Various forms of collagen have well-established roles in peripheral organs, but little is known about their functions in the brain. We are unaware of reports demonstrating activities of neuronal collagen VI. We analyzed hippocampal Col6a1 expression in nontransgenic and hAPP mice (lines J20 (refs. 1 , 3 ) and J9 (ref. 4 )) and humans with or without Alzheimer’s disease by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. At 3–6 months of age, Col6a1 mRNA and ?1(VI) protein levels in dentate gyrus were higher in hAPP-J20 mice than in nontransgenic controls ( Fig. 1a,b ). Additional hAPP-J20 mice, aged 2–18 months, also had higher hippocampal levels of Col6a1 mRNA ( Supplementary Fig. 1 online). In hAPP-J9 mice, which express about half as much hAPP/A? as hAPP-J20 mice 4 , hippocampal Col6a1 mRNA levels were elevated, but to a lesser extent ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). In humans, Col6a1 mRNA levels in dentate gyrus were higher in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease than in nondemented controls ( Fig. 1c ). Humans with Alzheimer’s disease and hAPP-J20 mice also showed higher dentate levels of Col6a2 mRNA and a trend toward increased expression of Col6a3 ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). In situ hybridization to identify the cellular source of Col6a1 revealed marked increases in expression in dentate gyrus granule cells in most hAPP-J20 mice ( Fig. 1d ). Less prominent increases were identified in the pyramidal layer of hippocampal subregions CA1 and CA3 and in the neocortex ( Fig. 1d and data not shown). To determine whether A? increases the expression of Col6a1 mRNA and ?1(VI) protein in neurons, we incubated primary hippocampal and cortical neurons from nontransgenic mice with synthetic human A?42 oligomers ( Supplementary Fig. 2 online) or a control peptide with a reversed sequence (A?rev). A?42, but not A?rev, increased neuronal Col6a1 mRNA and ?1(VI) protein levels in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 1e,f ). Because A? 5 and collagen I 6 bind APP, we tested primary neuronal cultures from APP-deficient mice. A? increased ?1(VI) expression in these cultures ( Fig. 1g ), indicating that APP-dependent signaling is not critical in this process. Because astrocytes participate in clearing extracellular A? and contribute to ECM production and remodeling 7 , we tested their response to A?42. A?42 did not affect ?1(VI) expression in primary astroctye cultures ( Fig. 1h ), but it did increase ?1(VI) expression in mixed neuronal/glial cultures ( Fig. 1i ). Thus, A?42 has neuron-specific effects on ?1(VI) expression that are probably independent of astroglial activities. To determine how A? regulates ?1(VI) expression, we focused on a Smad3-responsive element in the Col6a1 promoter region, identified in fibroblasts 8 . The transcription factor Smad3 regulates gene expression that is triggered by the injury-responsive cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF-?) 9 . Hippocampal TGF-? levels were increased in hAPP-J20 mice ( Fig. 1j ). In primary neuronal cultures, TGF-?1 increased Col6a1 expression ( Fig. 1k ). To determine whether TGF-? signaling mediates this effect, we treated primary neurons with a Smad3 inhibitor. Preventing Smad3 activation blocked the A?42-induced increase in ?1(VI) expression ( Fig. 1l ). Thus, Smad3 may regulate ?1(VI) in neurons as well as in fibroblasts 8 , and the A?42-induced increase in neuronal ?1(VI) expression may be mediated by TGF-? and related signaling pathways. Next, we focused on the TGF-? type II receptor (T?RII), which regulates Smad3 activation 9 and can modulate A? toxicity 10 . We tested the effect of A?42 on primary neuronal cultures from conditional knockout mice lacking T?RII expression in forebrain neurons. Unlike wild-type neurons, T?RII-deficient neurons failed to increase ?1(VI) expression in response to A?42 oligomers ( Fig. 1m ). Taken together, these results suggest that A?42-induced increases in neuronal ?1(VI) expression involve T?RII-dependent activation of Smad3. What functions may collagen VI fulfill in the nervous system? Because collagen VI inhibits apoptosis in cells of peripheral organs 11 , we tested whether it increases neuronal resistance to A? neurotoxicity by analyzing primary neuronal cultures from ?1(VI)-deficient mice, which cannot produce collagen VI (ref. 12 ). Although ?1(VI) ablation did not diminish the survival of untreated cells, wild-type neurons were more resistant to A?42 oligomers than ?1(VI)-deficient neurons ( Fig. 2a ). We also examined the effect of purified collagen VI on A?-induced neurotoxicity more directly. The structure and assembly of collagen are highly dependent on pH 13 . Fibrillar collagen VI was abundant at pH 7–8, whereas nonfibrillar, denatured species predominated at pH 2–3 ( Fig. 2b ). Treatment of wild-type and ?1(VI)-deficient (data not shown) neurons with collagen VI at pH 7–8 prevented A?42-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 2c ). Denatured collagen VI and fibrillar collagen I were not protective ( Fig. 2d,e ). To explore the mechanism of this protection, we examined whether collagen VI alters the interaction of A?42 oligomers with neurons in culture. In the absence of collagen VI, A?42 oligomers were closely associated with neurons ( Fig. 2f ), probably reflecting binding of A?42 to neuronal surfaces, neuronal uptake of A?42 oligomers, or both 14 , 15 . Notably, collagen VI blocked the association of A?42 oligomers with immature ( Fig. 2f ) and mature ( Fig. 2g ) neurons, whereas collagen I did not ( Fig. 2g and data not shown). In the presence of collagen VI, A?42 oligomers were sequestered into large aggregates that colocalized with collagen VI in the extracellular milieu ( Fig. 2h ). Atomic force microscopy showed that collagen VI promoted the assembly of A?42 into larger aggregates ( Fig. 2i,j ), resulting in fewer potentially neurotoxic A? oligomers ( Fig. 2k ). Thus, collagen VI may prevent A?42 neurotoxicity, at least in part, by promoting the extracellular sequestration of A?42 oligomers and preventing their interaction with neurons. Our findings reveal previously unknown actions of collagen VI in the nervous system and suggest that increased collagen VI expression in the brains of hAPP mice and individuals with Alzheimer’s disease is a neuroprotective response. It is unlikely that this response is completely specific to A?42-induced injury, as hydrogen peroxide also increased Col6a1 expression in primary neurons, albeit to lesser extent than A?42 (data not shown). A?42 oligomers increased ?1(VI) expression in neurons by an astrocyte-independent mechanism involving T?RII and Smad3 activation. TGF-? can promote apoptosis under specific circumstances, but also fulfills many beneficial functions in injury responses and ECM organization. Because hAPP-J20 mice had increased hippocampal levels of TGF-?, this cytokine may mediate the effect of A?42 on neuronal collagen VI expression. However, we cannot exclude that another factor or even A? itself binds to T?RII, activating T?RII-dependent signaling and gene expression. The ability of collagen VI to block the interaction between A?42 oligomers and neurons is a plausible mechanism for its neuroprotective effect and might be instructive in the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating Alzheimer’s disease. Additional mechanisms cannot be excluded and merit further investigation.
