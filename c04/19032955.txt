Changes in the Structure and Function of ICC Networks in ICC Hyperplasia and Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Background & Aims Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) express the receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit. Approximately 90% of GISTs have gain-of-function mutations in the Kit gene, which leads to its constitutive activation and drives malignant behavior of GISTs. Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) express c-kit; however, it is unknown whether uncontrolled hyperplasia of ICC is responsible for GISTs. Here, we sought to determine whether gain-of-function mutations in Kit lead to hyperplasia of all classes of ICC, whether ICC hyperplasia begins before birth, and whether functional defects occur in ICC hyperplasia or the development of GISTs. Methods Heterozygous mutant KitV558?/+ mice that develop symptoms of human familial GISTs and prematurely die from pathology of the gastrointestinal tract were utilized and compared with wild-type controls. C-kit-immunohistochemistry and intracellular electrical recording of spontaneous and nerve-evoked activity were applied to examine the density and functionality of ICC in these mutants. Results There was considerable hyperplasia in all classes of ICC throughout the GI tract of KitV558?/+ mice, except for ICC in the deep muscular plexus of the intestine. Spontaneous electrical activity and postjunctional neural responses in hyperplastic ICC tissues appeared normal but were up-regulated in the cecum, where GISTs were commonly found. Conclusions Kit gain-of-function leads to hyperplasia of most classes of ICC throughout the GI tract. ICC retain normal pacemaker function and enteric neural responses well after development of hyperplasia.  Materials and Methods Animals Mutant KitV558?/+ mice were generated as previously described. 16 Heterozygote males were mated with C57BL/6J females to produce KitV558?/+ heterozygotes and homozygote controls. Age-matched mice on the same background as KitV558?/+ mice (C57BL/6J) were used as controls. Preterm animals were killed at embryonic day (E) 19 and adult animals between postterm day (P) 40 and P60 for morphologic and electrophysiologic studies. Animals were maintained and experiments performed in accordance with the NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee at the University of Nevada. Morphologic Analysis and Volume Rendering Whole mounts and cryostat sections of GI tissues were processed for immunohistochemical analysis of c-kit as previously described. 3 , 4 For double-labeling experiments, cryostat sections were incubated in the c-kit antibody (ACK2) 4 , 5 overnight followed by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.01 mol/L; 2 hours) before incubation with a rabbit anti-smooth muscle myosin II heavy chain (1:100; Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA). Sections were subsequently washed in PBS and incubated consecutively in Alexa Fluor 594-coupled goat anti-rat 594 and Alexa Fluor 488-coupled goat anti-rabbit (1:1000; for 1 hour each at room temperature). Tissues and sections were examined with an LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany) using excitation wavelengths appropriate for Alexa Fluor 488 and 594. Z-series scans were collected using a ×63 objective and 0.25- ? m steps. The confocal aperture was set ?1 Airy unit, and laser power and gain settings were kept the same between specimens. Stacks of images were attenuation corrected and deconvolved (AutoQuantX, Media-Cybernetics, MD) then imported into custom in-house software (Volumetry G6b, Grant W. Herring). The depths of specific layers of ICC (eg, intramuscular ICC [ICC-IM] or myenteric plexus region ICC [ICC-MY]) were recorded. C-kit-immunofluorescent cells were thresholded (background noise inclusion, <1%), and a modified marching cubes algorithm was used to calculate the subvoxel volume between adjacent optical sections throughout the stack. Both the average slice volume (expressed as percentage of the total slice volume) and the maximum slice volume (averaged over 1 ? m) were calculated for each defined ICC layer. Three-dimensional surface renderings were constructed and tilted 40° in the x-axis. Double-labeled images were constructed using Zeiss LSM-5 Image Examiner software (Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc, Thornwood, NY) and converted to .tif files for final processing in Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Mountain View, CA) and Corel Draw 12.0 (Ontario, Canada). Electrophysiologic Studies Gastric fundus and antrum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and proximal colon were removed and placed in Krebs–Ringer buffer (KRB). Strips of each organ were mounted with circular muscle upward in a recording chamber, and impalements of circular muscle cells were made with microelectrodes (80–120 M?). Transmembrane potentials were recorded as described previously. 1 Nifedipine (1 ? mol/L) was added to reduce contractions and facilitate maintenance of impalements, except where stated. Slow waves are not affected by nifedipine, as shown previously. 1 , 20 Enteric motor neurons were stimulated in muscles strips by electrical field stimulation (EFS; 0.3-ms pulse durations, 1 pulse-20 Hz, train duration of 1 second, 10–15 volts). Solutions and Drugs The recording chamber was perfused with oxygenated KRB (in mmol/L): NaCl 118.5; KCl 4.5; MgCl2 1.2; NaHCO3 23.8; KH2PO4 1.2; dextrose 11.0; CaCl2 2.4. The pH of the KRB was 7.3–7.4 when bubbled with 97% O2–3% CO2 at 37 ± 0.5°C. Nifedipine (Sigma Chemical Co.; St Louis, MO) was dissolved in ethanol (10 mmol/L) before further dilution in KRB (1 ? mol/L). Atropine, apamin, N ? -nitro-L-arginine (L-NA) and tetrodotoxin (Sigma Chemical Co) were dissolved in deionized H2O before dilution in KRB to desired concentrations. Analysis of Data Data are expressed as means ± standard errors of the mean and tested for significance with Student t test. P < .05 was taken as significant. The “n” values refer to number of animals. Several electrical parameters were analyzed: (1) resting membrane potential (RMP); (2) slow wave amplitude; (3) duration of slow wave; and (4) frequency. Responses to EFS were analyzed as excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) or inhibitory junction potentials (IJPs) or phase advancement in slow waves. Changes in slow wave duration to EFS were compared with the average of 5 spontaneous events prior to EFS.

Changes in slow wave duration to EFS were compared with the average of 5 spontaneous events prior to EFS.  Results Gross Morphology KitV558?/+ mice and +/+ controls (either E19 or P40–P60) were used. Mice developed enlarged cecums and nodular masses, as previously described. 16 The small intestines of these animals were grossly distended for up to 100 mm above the ileal-cecal junction. Below the cecum and above the distended region of small bowel, the remainder of the GI tract was grossly normal in appearance. c-kit-Positive Cells in Kit<sup>V558?</sup>/+ Mutants vs Wild-Type Controls c-kit-Positive cells in KitV558?/+ and +/+ mice were examined using immunofluorescence techniques. Gastric fundus In cryostat sections and whole mount preparations of the gastric fundus, c-kit-like immunoreactive (c-kit-LI) cells were observed in the circular (CM) and longitudinal (LM) muscle layers. The cells with c-kit-LI were spindle shaped and dispersed within muscle bundles and ran orthogonal to each other in the CM and LM ( Figure 1 A and B ), as previously described for ICC-IM. 3 Density images and calculations of volume of c-kit-positive cells showed that ICC-IM increased significantly in KitV558?/+ mice ( Supplementary Table 1 ; see Supplementary material online at www.gastrojournal.org ). The muscle layers were also increased in thickness in association with the expansion in c-kit-positive cells ( Figure 1 B ). Gastric antrum Two populations of ICC were observed in the antrum, as previously reported. 3 Spindle-shaped ICC-IM were interspersed within the CM and ran parallel to the CM fibers ( Figure 1 C and D ). ICC-MY were present in the intermuscular plane between CM and LM ( Figure 1 C ). c-kit-Positive cells were greatly increased in KitV558?/+ mice ( Figure 1 D ; Supplementary Table 1 ) to an extent that the ICC-MY developed a mat-like appearance with few intercellular spaces. Small intestine In samples of jejunum and ileum, c-kit-positive cells formed an anastomosing network of cells between CM and LM (ICC-MY) and within the deep muscular plexus (DMP) (ICC-DMP) near the submucosal surface of the CM ( Figure 2 A ). ICC-DMP formed a fine network with elongated cell bodies and lateral processes that contacted adjacent ICC-DMP ( Figure 2 A ). Partial obstruction of the small intestine leads to hypertrophy of the bowel and loss of ICC above the obstruction. 21 The small intestines of KitV558?/+ mice were obstructed because of the masses in the cecum and greatly distended; however, c-kit-positive cells were abundant and increased in density ( Supplementary Table 1 ). As in the stomach, ICC-MY developed a diffuse, mat-like appearance ( Figure 2 B ). Although there was significant enhancement in ICC-MY, significant hyperplasia was not observed in ICC-DMP ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Cecum c-kit-Positive cells formed networks within the CM and LM in the cecum and fine cellular processes contacted adjacent ICC-IM, forming a network. A second population of ICC generally shorter in length and possessing a dendritic morphology with numerous spiny projections was also present. ICC typically ran parallel to CM, but a few cells had no obvious orientation ( Figure 3 A ). In many cases, cecums of KitV558?/+ mice were hard and nodular, and whole mount preparations were not possible. Cryostat sections of these tissues were used to inspect cells with c-kit-LI. c-kit-Positive cells in these tissues formed a mass with no morphologic identity as ICC ( Figure 3 B ; Supplementary Table 1 ). Proximal colon c-kit-Positive cells were located along the submucosal surface of CM (ICC-SM), within CM and LM (ICC-IM), and between CM and LM (ICC-MY; Figure 3 C ). 12 , 22 ICC-SM were orientated parallel to the muscle fibers of CM and ICC-IM orientated parallel to muscle fibers of CM and LM and contacted adjacent ICC with thin processes. ICC-MY possessed multiple fine processes that formed an anastomosing network with adjacent ICC-MY ( Figure 3 C ). c-kit-Positive cells were increased in density in KitV558?/+ mice ( Figure 3 D ; Supplementary Table 1 ). ICC-MY were increased in number to where it was hard to distinguish individual cells. Distribution in ICC Before Birth in Kit<sup>V558?</sup>/+ Fetuses c-kit-Positive cells emerge at approximately E12.5 during normal development and form a network of ICC-MY by E17. 4 We examined E19 muscles to determine whether the hyperplasia of c-kit-positive cells develops before birth in KitV558?/+ mice. As in adults, c-kit-positive cells were increased in density throughout the GI tracts of fetal tissues. Therefore, gain-of-function of c-kit in KitV558?/+ mice results in hyperplasia of ICC prior to birth, and the ICC population continues to expand after birth ( Figure 4 ). Functional Changes in the GI Tracts of Kit<sup>V558?</sup> Mice vs Wild-Type Controls Gastric fundus and antrum RMP of fundus CM averaged ?41.1 ± 0.6 mV in wild-type mice. An ongoing discharge of spontaneous transient depolarizations (unitary potentials) was superimposed upon resting potentials, as previously described ( Figure 5 A ; n = 14) 3 , 23 RMPs of antral muscles averaged +64.1 ± 1.0 mV, and electrical slow waves (27.4 ± 3.0 mV in amplitude, 8.9 ± 0.6 seconds) occurred at a frequency of 3.7 ± 0.3 cycles min?1 (n = 14; Figure 5 B ). The electrical activity of gastric muscles of KitV558?/+ mice was similar to wild-type muscles. RMPs of fundus CM averaged ?41.1 ± 3.8 mV (n = 3), and ongoing unitary potentials were observed ( Figure 5 A ). Antral muscles of KitV558?/+ mice had RMPs of ?64.2 ± 1.7 mV (n = 7), and slow waves (28.2 ± 4.4 mV in amplitude and 7.5 ± 0.8 seconds) occurred 5.4 ± 0.4 cycles min?1 ( Figure 5 B ). There was no statistical difference in slow waves in wild-type and KitV558?/+ mice. EFS (1–20 Hz for 1 second) caused frequency-dependent IJPs in fundus muscles ( Figure 5 A ). IJPs were reduced by L-NNA (100 ? mol/L), unmasking an EJP that was inhibited by atropine (1 ? mol/L). Blocking the EJP revealed a fast transient IJP that was apamin-sensitive (30 nmol/L; not shown). Postjunctional neural responses were similar in fundus muscles of KitV558?/+ mice. EFS caused IJPs averaging 8.3 ± 2.3 mV in amplitude and 2.7 ± 0.2 seconds in duration. L-NNA (100 ? mol/L) reduced the amplitude and duration of IJPs and unmasked an EJP that was reduced by atropine ( Figure 5 A ). Antral muscles responded to EFS by generating IJPs averaging 8.9 ± 1.2 mV and 1.8 ± 0.1s ( Figure 5 B ). The next slow wave was phase-advanced upon termination of the IJP. KitV558?/+ mice also responded to EFS by generating IJPs that averaged 7.3 ± 1.4 mV in amplitude and 1.8 ± 0.2 seconds in duration. IJPs were largely blocked in antral muscles of wild-type and KitV558?/+ mice by L-NNA (not shown). Small intestine RMPs of jejunal CM cells of wild-type muscles averaged ?59.2 ± 0.6 mV, and slow waves (21.3 ± 2.6 mV in amplitude and 1.2 ± 0.1 seconds in duration) occurred at 35.4 ± 1.4 cycles min?1 ( Figure 6 A ). In ileum, RMPs averaged ?60.9 ± 0.3 mV, and slow waves 21.7 ± 1.3 mV in amplitude and 1.3 ± 0.1 seconds in duration occurred at 30.2 ± 0.7 cycles min?1 ( Figure 6 A ). RMP of jejunual CM of KitV558?/+ mice averaged ?61.0 ± 0.8 mV, and slow waves (22.1 ± 2.5 mV in amplitude and 1.3 ± 0.2 seconds) occurred at 32.7 ± 2.1 cycles min?1 ( Figure 6 B ). RMP of ileal CM of KitV558?/+ mice averaged ?60.9 ± 1.1 mV, and slow waves (29.3 ± 1.8 mV in amplitude and 1.3 ± 0.1 seconds) occurred at 29.3 ± 1.8 cycles min?1 ( Figure 6 B ). The pacemaker activity of jejunums and ileums of wild-type and KitV558?/+ mice was not statistically different. EFS of small intestinal muscles caused frequency-dependent IJPs (eg, 8.6 ± 1.0 mV at 10 Hz) and attenuation of several slow waves following EFS ( Figure 6 C ). IJPs and effects on slow waves were reduced by L-NNA (100 ? mol/L), although a transient, apamin-sensitive IJP persisted after L-NNA ( Figure 6 C ). EFS of small intestinal muscles from KitV558?/+ mice also caused L-NNA-sensitive IJPs (eg, 6.8 ± 1.0 mV at 10 Hz) and attenuation of several slow waves after EFS ( Figure 6 D ). Cecum CM from wild-type cecums had RMPs of ?55.0 ± 0.9 mV and was electrically quiescent ( Figure 7 A ). As described above, cecums of KitV558?/+ mice varied in gross morphology; some contained nodular masses, and others were fluid filled and distended. We were unable to make impalements in cells of tissues with nodular masses. RMP of CM in distended cecums averaged ?55.9 ± 0.9 mV. In contrast to wild-type muscles, 33% of cecums of KitV558?/+ mice generated spontaneous slow waves (2 muscles of 9 mice) or spike complexes (1 of 9; Figure 7 B ). Slow waves and spike complexes were blocked by nifedipine (1 ? mol/L; Figure 7 C ). EFS of wild-type cecum muscles consisted of transient IJPs that were insensitive to L-NNA (100 ? mol/L). Neural responses of KitV558?/+ cecums also consisted of L-NNA-insensitive IJPs. In contrast to wild-type muscles, rebound excitation often occurred at the break of IJPs (neural responses not shown). Proximal colon RMPs of CM from wild-type colonic muscles averaged ?53.0 ± 1.0 mV (n = 20 animals). Spontaneous spike complexes (30.0 ± 3.0 mV) occurred at 2.7 ± 0.3 cycles min?1, as previously reported. 22 Each complex consisted of 13.8 ± 1.2 action potentials ( Figure 8 A ). Proximal colon CM of KitV558?/+ mice had RMPs of ?51.0 ± 3.0 mV (n = 10 animals). Spontaneous activity of KitV558?/+ colons was not significantly different than wild-type mice (eg, spike complexes of 35.4 ± 5.2 mV occurred at 2.3 ± 0.3 cycles min?1; Figure 8 B ). EFS (single pulse, 0.3 ms) elicited biphasic IJPs (first and second components were 19.7 ± 2.3 mV and 12.0 ± 1.0 mV and 0.8 ± 0.03 and 8.1 ± 0.3 seconds, respectively; Figure 8 C ). Similar responses were observed in CM of KitV558?/+ colons (eg, first and second components were 17.5 ± 0.1 mV and 10.7 ± 1.3 mV and 0.8 ± 0.03 and 7.6 ± 0.3 seconds, respectively; Figure 8 D ; n = 10; P > .05).

As described above, cecums of KitV558?/+ mice varied in gross morphology; some contained nodular masses, and others were fluid filled and distended. We were unable to make impalements in cells of tissues with nodular masses. RMP of CM in distended cecums averaged ?55.9 ± 0.9 mV. In contrast to wild-type muscles, 33% of cecums of KitV558?/+ mice generated spontaneous slow waves (2 muscles of 9 mice) or spike complexes (1 of 9; Figure 7 B ). Slow waves and spike complexes were blocked by nifedipine (1 ? mol/L; Figure 7 C ). EFS of wild-type cecum muscles consisted of transient IJPs that were insensitive to L-NNA (100 ? mol/L). Neural responses of KitV558?/+ cecums also consisted of L-NNA-insensitive IJPs. In contrast to wild-type muscles, rebound excitation often occurred at the break of IJPs (neural responses not shown). Proximal colon RMPs of CM from wild-type colonic muscles averaged ?53.0 ± 1.0 mV (n = 20 animals). Spontaneous spike complexes (30.0 ± 3.0 mV) occurred at 2.7 ± 0.3 cycles min?1, as previously reported. 22 Each complex consisted of 13.8 ± 1.2 action potentials ( Figure 8 A ). Proximal colon CM of KitV558?/+ mice had RMPs of ?51.0 ± 3.0 mV (n = 10 animals). Spontaneous activity of KitV558?/+ colons was not significantly different than wild-type mice (eg, spike complexes of 35.4 ± 5.2 mV occurred at 2.3 ± 0.3 cycles min?1; Figure 8 B ). EFS (single pulse, 0.3 ms) elicited biphasic IJPs (first and second components were 19.7 ± 2.3 mV and 12.0 ± 1.0 mV and 0.8 ± 0.03 and 8.1 ± 0.3 seconds, respectively; Figure 8 C ). Similar responses were observed in CM of KitV558?/+ colons (eg, first and second components were 17.5 ± 0.1 mV and 10.7 ± 1.3 mV and 0.8 ± 0.03 and 7.6 ± 0.3 seconds, respectively; Figure 8 D ; n = 10; P > .05).  Gross Morphology KitV558?/+ mice and +/+ controls (either E19 or P40–P60) were used. Mice developed enlarged cecums and nodular masses, as previously described. 16 The small intestines of these animals were grossly distended for up to 100 mm above the ileal-cecal junction. Below the cecum and above the distended region of small bowel, the remainder of the GI tract was grossly normal in appearance.

Gastric fundus In cryostat sections and whole mount preparations of the gastric fundus, c-kit-like immunoreactive (c-kit-LI) cells were observed in the circular (CM) and longitudinal (LM) muscle layers. The cells with c-kit-LI were spindle shaped and dispersed within muscle bundles and ran orthogonal to each other in the CM and LM ( Figure 1 A and B ), as previously described for ICC-IM. 3 Density images and calculations of volume of c-kit-positive cells showed that ICC-IM increased significantly in KitV558?/+ mice ( Supplementary Table 1 ; see Supplementary material online at www.gastrojournal.org ). The muscle layers were also increased in thickness in association with the expansion in c-kit-positive cells ( Figure 1 B ). Gastric antrum Two populations of ICC were observed in the antrum, as previously reported. 3 Spindle-shaped ICC-IM were interspersed within the CM and ran parallel to the CM fibers ( Figure 1 C and D ). ICC-MY were present in the intermuscular plane between CM and LM ( Figure 1 C ). c-kit-Positive cells were greatly increased in KitV558?/+ mice ( Figure 1 D ; Supplementary Table 1 ) to an extent that the ICC-MY developed a mat-like appearance with few intercellular spaces. Small intestine In samples of jejunum and ileum, c-kit-positive cells formed an anastomosing network of cells between CM and LM (ICC-MY) and within the deep muscular plexus (DMP) (ICC-DMP) near the submucosal surface of the CM ( Figure 2 A ). ICC-DMP formed a fine network with elongated cell bodies and lateral processes that contacted adjacent ICC-DMP ( Figure 2 A ). Partial obstruction of the small intestine leads to hypertrophy of the bowel and loss of ICC above the obstruction. 21 The small intestines of KitV558?/+ mice were obstructed because of the masses in the cecum and greatly distended; however, c-kit-positive cells were abundant and increased in density ( Supplementary Table 1 ). As in the stomach, ICC-MY developed a diffuse, mat-like appearance ( Figure 2 B ). Although there was significant enhancement in ICC-MY, significant hyperplasia was not observed in ICC-DMP ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Cecum c-kit-Positive cells formed networks within the CM and LM in the cecum and fine cellular processes contacted adjacent ICC-IM, forming a network. A second population of ICC generally shorter in length and possessing a dendritic morphology with numerous spiny projections was also present. ICC typically ran parallel to CM, but a few cells had no obvious orientation ( Figure 3 A ). In many cases, cecums of KitV558?/+ mice were hard and nodular, and whole mount preparations were not possible. Cryostat sections of these tissues were used to inspect cells with c-kit-LI. c-kit-Positive cells in these tissues formed a mass with no morphologic identity as ICC ( Figure 3 B ; Supplementary Table 1 ). Proximal colon c-kit-Positive cells were located along the submucosal surface of CM (ICC-SM), within CM and LM (ICC-IM), and between CM and LM (ICC-MY; Figure 3 C ). 12 , 22 ICC-SM were orientated parallel to the muscle fibers of CM and ICC-IM orientated parallel to muscle fibers of CM and LM and contacted adjacent ICC with thin processes. ICC-MY possessed multiple fine processes that formed an anastomosing network with adjacent ICC-MY ( Figure 3 C ). c-kit-Positive cells were increased in density in KitV558?/+ mice ( Figure 3 D ; Supplementary Table 1 ). ICC-MY were increased in number to where it was hard to distinguish individual cells.  c-kit-Positive Cells in Kit<sup>V558?</sup>/+ Mutants vs Wild-Type Controls c-kit-Positive cells in KitV558?/+ and +/+ mice were examined using immunofluorescence techniques.

Distribution in ICC Before Birth in Kit<sup>V558?</sup>/+ Fetuses c-kit-Positive cells emerge at approximately E12.5 during normal development and form a network of ICC-MY by E17. 4 We examined E19 muscles to determine whether the hyperplasia of c-kit-positive cells develops before birth in KitV558?/+ mice. As in adults, c-kit-positive cells were increased in density throughout the GI tracts of fetal tissues. Therefore, gain-of-function of c-kit in KitV558?/+ mice results in hyperplasia of ICC prior to birth, and the ICC population continues to expand after birth ( Figure 4 ).

Functional Changes in the GI Tracts of Kit<sup>V558?</sup> Mice vs Wild-Type Controls Gastric fundus and antrum RMP of fundus CM averaged ?41.1 ± 0.6 mV in wild-type mice. An ongoing discharge of spontaneous transient depolarizations (unitary potentials) was superimposed upon resting potentials, as previously described ( Figure 5 A ; n = 14) 3 , 23 RMPs of antral muscles averaged +64.1 ± 1.0 mV, and electrical slow waves (27.4 ± 3.0 mV in amplitude, 8.9 ± 0.6 seconds) occurred at a frequency of 3.7 ± 0.3 cycles min?1 (n = 14; Figure 5 B ). The electrical activity of gastric muscles of KitV558?/+ mice was similar to wild-type muscles. RMPs of fundus CM averaged ?41.1 ± 3.8 mV (n = 3), and ongoing unitary potentials were observed ( Figure 5 A ). Antral muscles of KitV558?/+ mice had RMPs of ?64.2 ± 1.7 mV (n = 7), and slow waves (28.2 ± 4.4 mV in amplitude and 7.5 ± 0.8 seconds) occurred 5.4 ± 0.4 cycles min?1 ( Figure 5 B ). There was no statistical difference in slow waves in wild-type and KitV558?/+ mice. EFS (1–20 Hz for 1 second) caused frequency-dependent IJPs in fundus muscles ( Figure 5 A ). IJPs were reduced by L-NNA (100 ? mol/L), unmasking an EJP that was inhibited by atropine (1 ? mol/L). Blocking the EJP revealed a fast transient IJP that was apamin-sensitive (30 nmol/L; not shown). Postjunctional neural responses were similar in fundus muscles of KitV558?/+ mice. EFS caused IJPs averaging 8.3 ± 2.3 mV in amplitude and 2.7 ± 0.2 seconds in duration. L-NNA (100 ? mol/L) reduced the amplitude and duration of IJPs and unmasked an EJP that was reduced by atropine ( Figure 5 A ). Antral muscles responded to EFS by generating IJPs averaging 8.9 ± 1.2 mV and 1.8 ± 0.1s ( Figure 5 B ). The next slow wave was phase-advanced upon termination of the IJP. KitV558?/+ mice also responded to EFS by generating IJPs that averaged 7.3 ± 1.4 mV in amplitude and 1.8 ± 0.2 seconds in duration.

The pacemaker activity of jejunums and ileums of wild-type and KitV558?/+ mice was not statistically different. EFS of small intestinal muscles caused frequency-dependent IJPs (eg, 8.6 ± 1.0 mV at 10 Hz) and attenuation of several slow waves following EFS ( Figure 6 C ). IJPs and effects on slow waves were reduced by L-NNA (100 ? mol/L), although a transient, apamin-sensitive IJP persisted after L-NNA ( Figure 6 C ).

Spontaneous activity of KitV558?/+ colons was not significantly different than wild-type mice (eg, spike complexes of 35.4 ± 5.2 mV occurred at 2.3 ± 0.3 cycles min?1; Figure 8 B ). EFS (single pulse, 0.3 ms) elicited biphasic IJPs (first and second components were 19.7 ± 2.3 mV and 12.0 ± 1.0 mV and 0.8 ± 0.03 and 8.1 ± 0.3 seconds, respectively; Figure 8 C ). Similar responses were observed in CM of KitV558?/+ colons (eg, first and second components were 17.5 ± 0.1 mV and 10.7 ± 1.3 mV and 0.8 ± 0.03 and 7.6 ± 0.3 seconds, respectively; Figure 8 D ; n = 10; P > .05).  Gastric fundus and antrum RMP of fundus CM averaged ?41.1 ± 0.6 mV in wild-type mice. An ongoing discharge of spontaneous transient depolarizations (unitary potentials) was superimposed upon resting potentials, as previously described ( Figure 5 A ; n = 14) 3 , 23 RMPs of antral muscles averaged +64.1 ± 1.0 mV, and electrical slow waves (27.4 ± 3.0 mV in amplitude, 8.9 ± 0.6 seconds) occurred at a frequency of 3.7 ± 0.3 cycles min?1 (n = 14; Figure 5 B ). The electrical activity of gastric muscles of KitV558?/+ mice was similar to wild-type muscles. RMPs of fundus CM averaged ?41.1 ± 3.8 mV (n = 3), and ongoing unitary potentials were observed ( Figure 5 A ). Antral muscles of KitV558?/+ mice had RMPs of ?64.2 ± 1.7 mV (n = 7), and slow waves (28.2 ± 4.4 mV in amplitude and 7.5 ± 0.8 seconds) occurred 5.4 ± 0.4 cycles min?1 ( Figure 5 B ). There was no statistical difference in slow waves in wild-type and KitV558?/+ mice. EFS (1–20 Hz for 1 second) caused frequency-dependent IJPs in fundus muscles ( Figure 5 A ). IJPs were reduced by L-NNA (100 ? mol/L), unmasking an EJP that was inhibited by atropine (1 ? mol/L). Blocking the EJP revealed a fast transient IJP that was apamin-sensitive (30 nmol/L; not shown). Postjunctional neural responses were similar in fundus muscles of KitV558?/+ mice. EFS caused IJPs averaging 8.3 ± 2.3 mV in amplitude and 2.7 ± 0.2 seconds in duration. L-NNA (100 ? mol/L) reduced the amplitude and duration of IJPs and unmasked an EJP that was reduced by atropine ( Figure 5 A ). Antral muscles responded to EFS by generating IJPs averaging 8.9 ± 1.2 mV and 1.8 ± 0.1s ( Figure 5 B ). The next slow wave was phase-advanced upon termination of the IJP. KitV558?/+ mice also responded to EFS by generating IJPs that averaged 7.3 ± 1.4 mV in amplitude and 1.8 ± 0.2 seconds in duration. IJPs were largely blocked in antral muscles of wild-type and KitV558?/+ mice by L-NNA (not shown).  Gastric fundus and antrum RMP of fundus CM averaged ?41.1 ± 0.6 mV in wild-type mice.

IJPs were largely blocked in antral muscles of wild-type and KitV558?/+ mice by L-NNA (not shown).  Small intestine RMPs of jejunal CM cells of wild-type muscles averaged ?59.2 ± 0.6 mV, and slow waves (21.3 ± 2.6 mV in amplitude and 1.2 ± 0.1 seconds in duration) occurred at 35.4 ± 1.4 cycles min?1 ( Figure 6 A ). In ileum, RMPs averaged ?60.9 ± 0.3 mV, and slow waves 21.7 ± 1.3 mV in amplitude and 1.3 ± 0.1 seconds in duration occurred at 30.2 ± 0.7 cycles min?1 ( Figure 6 A ). RMP of jejunual CM of KitV558?/+ mice averaged ?61.0 ± 0.8 mV, and slow waves (22.1 ± 2.5 mV in amplitude and 1.3 ± 0.2 seconds) occurred at 32.7 ± 2.1 cycles min?1 ( Figure 6 B ). RMP of ileal CM of KitV558?/+ mice averaged ?60.9 ± 1.1 mV, and slow waves (29.3 ± 1.8 mV in amplitude and 1.3 ± 0.1 seconds) occurred at 29.3 ± 1.8 cycles min?1 ( Figure 6 B ). The pacemaker activity of jejunums and ileums of wild-type and KitV558?/+ mice was not statistically different. EFS of small intestinal muscles caused frequency-dependent IJPs (eg, 8.6 ± 1.0 mV at 10 Hz) and attenuation of several slow waves following EFS ( Figure 6 C ). IJPs and effects on slow waves were reduced by L-NNA (100 ? mol/L), although a transient, apamin-sensitive IJP persisted after L-NNA ( Figure 6 C ). EFS of small intestinal muscles from KitV558?/+ mice also caused L-NNA-sensitive IJPs (eg, 6.8 ± 1.0 mV at 10 Hz) and attenuation of several slow waves after EFS ( Figure 6 D ).  Small intestine RMPs of jejunal CM cells of wild-type muscles averaged ?59.2 ± 0.6 mV, and slow waves (21.3 ± 2.6 mV in amplitude and 1.2 ± 0.1 seconds in duration) occurred at 35.4 ± 1.4 cycles min?1 ( Figure 6 A ).

Cecum CM from wild-type cecums had RMPs of ?55.0 ± 0.9 mV and was electrically quiescent ( Figure 7 A ). As described above, cecums of KitV558?/+ mice varied in gross morphology; some contained nodular masses, and others were fluid filled and distended. We were unable to make impalements in cells of tissues with nodular masses. RMP of CM in distended cecums averaged ?55.9 ± 0.9 mV. In contrast to wild-type muscles, 33% of cecums of KitV558?/+ mice generated spontaneous slow waves (2 muscles of 9 mice) or spike complexes (1 of 9; Figure 7 B ). Slow waves and spike complexes were blocked by nifedipine (1 ? mol/L; Figure 7 C ). EFS of wild-type cecum muscles consisted of transient IJPs that were insensitive to L-NNA (100 ? mol/L). Neural responses of KitV558?/+ cecums also consisted of L-NNA-insensitive IJPs. In contrast to wild-type muscles, rebound excitation often occurred at the break of IJPs (neural responses not shown).

Proximal colon RMPs of CM from wild-type colonic muscles averaged ?53.0 ± 1.0 mV (n = 20 animals). Spontaneous spike complexes (30.0 ± 3.0 mV) occurred at 2.7 ± 0.3 cycles min?1, as previously reported. 22 Each complex consisted of 13.8 ± 1.2 action potentials ( Figure 8 A ). Proximal colon CM of KitV558?/+ mice had RMPs of ?51.0 ± 3.0 mV (n = 10 animals). Spontaneous activity of KitV558?/+ colons was not significantly different than wild-type mice (eg, spike complexes of 35.4 ± 5.2 mV occurred at 2.3 ± 0.3 cycles min?1; Figure 8 B ). EFS (single pulse, 0.3 ms) elicited biphasic IJPs (first and second components were 19.7 ± 2.3 mV and 12.0 ± 1.0 mV and 0.8 ± 0.03 and 8.1 ± 0.3 seconds, respectively; Figure 8 C ). Similar responses were observed in CM of KitV558?/+ colons (eg, first and second components were 17.5 ± 0.1 mV and 10.7 ± 1.3 mV and 0.8 ± 0.03 and 7.6 ± 0.3 seconds, respectively; Figure 8 D ; n = 10; P > .05).

Discussion We characterized and quantified the density of c-kit+ cells in a GIST model with many of the features of human familial GIST, including hyperplasia of ICC beyond the margins of the primary tumor. 16 , 17 Extensive hyperplasia of all of the major classes of ICC was observed in the stomach and colon (ICC-IM and ICC-MY) but only ICC-MY, and not ICC-DMP, in the small intestine. Surprisingly, in spite of remarkable expansion in ICC mass, few demonstrable functional differences were observed in KitV558?/+ tissues (pacemaker activity and enteric motor neuron responses). In the cecum, where primary tumors developed, abnormal spontaneous electrical rhythmicity developed in some muscles before nodular masses were found. Enhancement in ICC was not matched by increased neural responses in KitV558?/+ mice. ICC-IM are innervated by enteric motor neurons but do not require interactions with neurons for development. ICC developed normally in GDNF?/? mice that lack enteric neurons distal to the proximal stomach. 24 Likewise, when ICC-IM are absent, varicose processes of enteric motor neurons are distributed normally within GI muscles. 3 Synaptic contacts form between enteric motor neurons and ICC-IM during normal development, 25 and major inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters, nitric oxide and acetylcholine, appear to be largely confined to these junctions. 3 , 26 Therefore, increasing the number of ICC-IM per se may not impact postjunctional neural responses unless this is accompanied by parallel enhancement in nerve terminals or synaptic contacts. It is harder to reconcile the seeming lack of effect of hyperplasia in most regions on pacemaker activity. Pacemaker activity and active propagation of slow waves are attributed to ICC-MY. 1 , 2 , 27 – 29 Thus, an increase in ICC-MY as observed in the antrum, small bowel, and colon might be expected to enhance pacemaker frequency or increase the magnitude of pacemaker currents and increase slow wave amplitude. Except for the emergence of spontaneous activity in the cecum, significant effects on slow wave behavior were not observed. During hyperplasia, ICC-MY possibly undergo down-regulation of the pacemaker mechanism or electrical coupling. An evaluation of the pacemaker activity of individual ICC will be needed to determine whether down-regulation of pacemaker function is a feature of pre-GIST hyperplasia. Resting potentials of wild-type cecum muscles showed electrical quiescence, but recordings from KitV558?/+ cecums before nodular GISTs developed revealed 2 atypical patterns of electrical activity: slow wave activity, more typical of the small intestine, and spike complexes, more typical of the colon. Unlike the slow waves of small intestine, the emergent slow waves in the cecum were blocked by nifedipine. A dramatic rearrangement of ICC and development of novel properties accompanied the hyperplasia of c-kit+ cells in the cecum. Mutant mice that developed neoplasms displayed spindle-shaped c-kit+ cells that differed from ICC in cecums of animals before solid tumors developed. It is unknown whether c-kit+ cells of solid tumors retained ICC function because we were unable to impale cells in these tumors. KitV558?/+ mice develop GISTs and eventually die from GI pathology, 16 possibly because of an obstruction caused by the mass that develops in the cecum. The observed distension of the small intestine is consistent with the formation of a partial obstruction. Partial obstructions of the small bowel result in distention for up to 100 mm above the obstruction, 21 and the appearance of the bowel is grossly similar to the small bowels of KitV558?/+ mice after formation of solid tumors in the cecum. In the previous study, ICC were greatly reduced above the site of obstruction. 21 Loss of ICC was accompanied by loss of electrical slow waves and postjunctional neural responses. These findings contrast to the current study in which ICC were present (normal numbers in the DMP and expanded density in the myenteric region) and electrical slow waves and neural responses were intact in the distended small intestines of KitV558?/+ mice. At present, the reasons for loss of ICC in the obstructed intestine are not fully understood, but c-kit ligand expression decreases in bowel obstruction (Hwang SJ and Ward SM, unpublished observations), and this might explain the loss of ICC in these tissues. 30 Reduced c-kit ligand would not be expected to affect ICC in KitV558?/+ mice because KitV558? is a gain-of-function in which c-kit is activated in the absence of ligand binding. 16 The onset of ICC hyperplasia in KitV558?/+ mice occurred prior to birth. Previous studies demonstrated that c-kit signaling prior to birth is required for establishment of the ICC phenotype 31 and development of functional ICC. 5 , 31 Others have argued that c-kit is only important for development and maintenance of the ICC phenotype after birth. 32 , 33 Data from the present study clearly show the significance of c-kit signaling for ICC during the late prenatal period because hyperplasia of ICC networks developed in KitV558?/+ mice before birth. GISTs were proposed to arise from proliferation of ICC because these were the only cells found to express c-kit and CD34 in the gut. 11 , 34 This idea was later challenged because c-kit and CD34 were found to be expressed by discrete populations of cells in the human and murine GI tract, 35 and doubts developed about the cellular origin of GIST. Recently, a rare population of putative stem cells (c-kitlowCD44+CD34+) was described that may be responsible for replacement of ICC because of normal turnover and the source of cells for GISTs. 13 c-kit+lowCD34+CD44+ cells required stimulation by insulin-like growth factor-I for proliferation and secondary stimulation by c-kitL to develop the ICC phenotype. 13 Constitutive activation of c-kit in KitV558?/+ mice might preclude the need for c-kit-L for proliferation of ICC progenitor cells. Stimulation by insulin-like growth factor-I or other growth factors in situ might expand the progenitor cell population throughout most regions of the GI tract normally populated by ICC. It should be noted that hyperplasia of c-kit+/ICC began before birth, so abnormal expansion of this population likely results from overstimulation of early developmental pathways for ICC rather than postnatal activation of a specialized pool of adult stem cells. We investigated previously the emergence of c-kit-positive cells and cells with the morphologic and functional phenotypes of ICC in the murine small intestine. These experiments showed that c-kit-positive cells line the exterior of the gut at E15 and develop ICC-like morphology and function by E17. 31 We also found that early c-kit+ precursor cells undergo a lineage decision at approximately E15 and develop into either mature ICC or longitudinal muscle cells. We concluded that the lineage decision might depend on c-kit signaling, such that cells receiving c-kitL stimulation from opposing cells developed into mature ICC, but cells without direct contact to c-kitL developed into longitudinal muscles cells. The present study argues against this hypothesis, however, because c-kit is constitutively active in KitV558?/+ and longitudinal muscle developed in these mice (although it was thin and penetrated by c-kit-positive cells in some images). These data suggest that a positive signal (besides the lack of c-kit signaling) might be necessary for early c-kit-positive precursors to develop into a smooth muscle phenotype. 36 In summary, KitV558?/+ mice develop neoplastic lesions in the cecum that lead to obstruction, as evidenced by distension of the small intestine. KitV558?/+ mice display dramatic hyperplasia of most classes of ICC, from the stomach to the colon. ICC-DMP of the small intestine, however, were not increased in numbers or density. Despite marked hyperplasia of ICC, functional characteristics are retained, and few differences were noted in the electrical behavior or responses to enteric motor neurons in KitV558?/+ mice. An exception was the emergence of electrical rhythmicity in the cecum. Hyperplasia of ICC develops before birth in KitV558?/+ mice, suggesting that c-kit signaling in the fetus regulates the density and normal distribution of ICC.
