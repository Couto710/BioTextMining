Synapse Loss Regulated by Matrix Metalloproteinases in Traumatic Brain Injury Is Associated with Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1? Expression The present study assessed the role of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and -9 in synapse loss after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the role of hypoxia inducible factor-1? (HIF-1? a transcription factor upregulated during hypoxia, in the regulation of MMP-2 and -9 expression post TBI. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=6 per group, 400g-425g) were injured using Marmarou's closed head acceleration impact model and allowed to survive for 1, 4, 24 and 48 hours. In another set of experiments, 30 minutes after TBI, animals were treated with Minocycline (inhibitor of MMPs), or 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2, inhibitor of HIF-1?) and sacrificed at 4 hours after injury. Relative amounts of synaptophysin, a presynaptic vesicular protein, HIF-1?, as well as MMP-2 and -9 were assessed by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Activity levels of MMP-2 and -9 were determined by zymography. Synaptophysin expression was significantly (p<0.05) decreased at 1 hour through 48 hours after TBI. A significant increase in gene and protein expressions of HIF-1?, MMP-2 and -9, as well as enzyme activity of MMP-2 and -9 at the same time points was also detected. Inhibition of either MMPs or HIF-1? significantly reversed the TBI-induced decrease in synaptophysin. Inhibition of HIF-1? reduced expression of MMP-2 and -9. This study showed an early detection of a correlation between synaptic loss and MMP expression after TBI. The data also supports a role for HIF-1? in the MMP regulatory cascade in synapse loss after TBI, suggesting potential targets for reducing loss of synaptic terminals.  INTRODUCTION Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a leading cause of death and disability in the industrialized world ( Naredi et al., 1998 ; Warme et al., 1991 ). In the United States, every year there are approximately 50,000 deaths following TBI, accounting for one-third of all injury deaths ( Chua et al., 2007 ). Of those that do not die, 80,000 to 90,000 people are permanently disabled ( Chua et al., 2007 ) and the costs for long term care are estimated at $40-50 billion each year. Most of those TBIs are related to vehicle accidents and affect young adults and children. In addition, TBI is known as the signature injury of soldiers currently fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, with possibly 80% of all soldiers afflicted with it, according to Department of Defense estimates ( Hoge et al., 2008 ). The result of surviving an explosion then, is traumatic close-head brain injury ( French and Parkinson, 2008 ). Primary injury is the result of immediate mechanical damage that occurs at the time of event, while secondary injury evolves over a period of days to months. Although the precise mechanisms underlying secondary injury are not well understood, one result of TBI is long-term cognitive dysfunction and loss of memory that affects children and adults alike. Numerous studies have indicated that brain trauma results in significant alterations in both motor skills and cognition ( Lyeth et al., 1990 ; Smith et al., 1991 ; Hamm et al., 1992 ; Hoffman et al., 1994 ; Dash et al., 1995 ; Scheff et al., 1997 ). The studies further suggest that children and adolescents may be especially vulnerable to the deleterious effects of closed head (diffuse) injury on memory and intellectual ability ( Levin et al., 1982 ; Ewing-Cobbs et al., 1998 ). Memory storage and learning have been found to be associated with synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to adapt to their environment and new conditions ( Semchenko et al., 2006 ; Duffau, 2006 ). During acute closed head injury and its aftermath, rapid acceleration and deceleration of the head causes diffuse axonal injury, where neural axons are sheared and even severed from the rest of their cells, through the entire brain ( Rafols et al., 2007 ). Although the neurons themselves do not actually die with their dendrites and cell bodies remaining intact, diffuse axonal injury is a frequent result of traumatic deceleration injuries and is the most significant cause of morbidity in patients with TBI ( Smith et al., 2003 ). As a consequence of diffuse axonal injury, the synapses associated with the injured neural axons are destroyed, leading to severe synaptic loss ( Scheff et al., 2005 ; Rafols et al., 2007 ), or severely disrupts synaptic plasticity ( Semchenko et al., 2006 ), which largely contributes to long-term behavioral disorder. However, the molecular mechanisms by which TBI causes synapse loss in the early stages remains unclear. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of enzymes, including gelatinases (MMP-2 and -9), that regulate extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and are found in the brain parenchyma in response to pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis, arthritis, cancer, and neurodegeneration ( Cunningham et al., 2005 ). Recent studies have indicated that MMPs are strongly associated with synaptic plasticity ( Meighan et al., 2006 ; Bozdagi et al., 2007 ; Agrawal et al., 2008 ). Altered regulation of MMPs is associated with cognitive impairments that are linked to several nervous system disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and glioblastomas ( Meighan et al., 2006 ). Up-regulation of MMPs, specifically MMP-2 and -9, which has been demonstrated after TBI ( Wang et al., 2000 ; Truettner et al., 2005 ; von et al., 2003 ; Wells et al., 2003 ), likely affects synaptic plasticity and synaptogenesis. However, whether TBI-induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 are involved in synapse loss has not been studied. Hypoxia inducible factor-1? (HIF-1?) is a protein normally scarce in cells, but greatly upregulated during hypoxia ( Wang et al., 1995 ). HIF-1? is believed to be a key component of the cellular response to pathophysiologic conditions, such as stroke ( Helton et al., 2005 ). However, it is unknown whether TBI causes an increase in HIF-1? expression, and whether HIF-1? expression affects MMP up-regulation, which would directly link hypoxia with synaptic plasticity. In the present study, we determined the biochemical cascade where TBI increases HIF-1? expression, which in turn, upregulates expression of MMPs, leading to synapse loss.  Experimental Procedures Subject A total of 42 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (400 - 425 g, Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were used. Animals were divided into one normal control group (n=6) and six TBI groups (n=6×6). TBI groups include animals sacrificed 1, 4, 24, and 48 hours after trauma, and animals treated with 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) or Minocycline. Closed-Head Trauma Model To produce TBI, Marmarou's rat acceleration impact model ( Marmarou et al., 1994 ) was used. Unlike other TBI models that directly injure the brain cortex (fluid percussion and cortical impact), the Marmarou model is a closed-head rather than an open-head TBI model. It is more representative of actual concussive TBI, which rarely involves penetration of the brain ( Rafols et al., 2007 ). Briefly, the anesthetized rats were placed prone on a foam-covered platform. A 450 g weight was first aligned with the surface of the steel helmet which was directly attached onto the skull over the sagittal suture and between the bregma and lambda sutures, and then dropped directly onto it from a height of 2 meters. The helmet was placed there to ensure that the skull would not be fractured during the trauma procedure, so the brain would not be directly impacted. Normal control animals were anesthetized and had the helmet attached to them, but they did not receive TBI. Inhibition of HIF-1? with Administration of 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) Six animals were administered with intravenous injections 30 minutes after head injury with 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg given over 1 minute in a total volume of 0.5 ml vehicle. 2ME2 is a naturally occurring metabolite of estradiol, which is known to post-transcriptionally inhibit HIF-1? expression ( Mabjeesh et al., 2003 ). Animals were sacrificed 4 hours after injury. Inhibition of MMPs with Administration of Minocycline Minocycline (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was administered with intravenous injections 30 minutes after closed head injury at a dosage of 1 mg/kg given over 1 minute in a total volume of 0.5 ml vehicle. Minocycline, a lipophilic tetracycline derivative, is well-known to inhibit MMP activity both in vitro and in vivo ( Machado et al., 2006 ; Leonardo et al., 2008 ; Nagel et al., 2008 ). Animals were sacrificed 4 hours after injury. Gene Expression of Synaptophysin, HIF-1?, MMP-2 and -9 The traumatized rats were sacrificed at 1, 4, 24, and 48 hours after TBI. Since Marmarou's model used in this study causes extensive diffuse injury, samples from the whole brain of each animal were used and homogenized and prepared for both mRNA and protein processing. A sensitive real-time reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique ( Ding et al., 2003 ) was used to determine expression of genes encoding synaptophysin (a marker protein to quantify numbers of synapses), HIF-1?, MMP-2 and MMP-9. The total RNA from half the amount of samplescontaining whole brain was isolated by using a RNA STAT-60 kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD). Random Primers from Promega were used to create First-strand DNA synthesis using SuperScript RNase H Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA was then amplified using an ABI Prism 7900HT sequencing detection system for real-time PCR with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix from Applied Biosystems. The gene specific rat primers for synaptophysin, HIF-1?, MMP-2 and -9 were designed or obtained from previous studies ( Table 1 ). For internal PCR control, the rat ribosomal protein L32 (rpL32) was used as a housekeeping gene for each sample. Reactions were performed in a 20 ?l volume with 0.5 ?M primers. The relative mRNA levels of gene expression were determined using the threshold cycle ( C T) and arithmetic formulas. Subtracting the CT of the housekeeping gene from the CT of target gene yields the ?CT in each group (control and experimental groups), which was entered into the equation 2-?CT and calculated. The mean amount of gene from control group was arbitrarily assigned a value of 1 to serve as a reference. The expression of the target gene from experimental groups represents the fold-difference expression relative to the reference gene. Protein Expression To investigate protein synthesis of Synaptophysin, HIF-1?, MMP-2 and MMP-9, Western blot analysis was used ( Kreipke et al., 2007 ). Samples containing both cerebral hemispheres were processed in lysis buffer including protease inhibitors on ice. Equal volumes (10 ul) of tissue extracts normalized by protein concentration were mixed with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer. The samples were separated by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Supernatants were used as whole-tissue lysates and protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). Four different primary antibodies were used: monoclonal mouse anti-synaptophysin (1:5,000, Sigma), polyclonal rabbit anti- HIF-1? (1:2,000, Santa Cruz), monoclonal anti-MMP-2 (AB808, 1:500, Chemicon), and polyclonal anti-MMP-9 (M 5427, 1:2000, Sigma). The targeted antigens were visualized by using the standard chemical luminescence methods (ECL, Amersham Parmacia Biotech). To quantify the relative levels of target protein expression, blot images for each antibody, including ?-actin, were analyzed using ChemiGeniusQ Image System, and the expression intensity of the proteins from different groups was statistically compared. Protein equal loading was confirmed by intracellular protein ?-actin analysis (goat polyclonal anti-?-actin antibody, dilution 1:1,000, Santa Cruz). MMP Enzyme Activity Determined by Zymography MMP-2 and MMP-9, known as gelatinase A and B, have intrinsic gelatinase activity. This property allows the zymographic analysis by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing gelatin. Gelatin zymography was used to determine the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 ( Swann et al., 2007 ). Enzyme activity attributed to MMP-2 and MMP-9 were visualized on the basis of molecular weight in the gelatin-containing zymograms as clear bands against a blue background. To quantify the relative levels of MMP expression, the zymogram images were analyzed using ChemiGeniusQ Image System. The intensity of MMP expression from different animal groups was statistically compared. Statistical analysis All the data was described as mean ± SE. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS for Windows, version 13.0 (SPSS, Inc.). The differences among multiple groups was assessed using one-way ANOVA analysis with a significance level at p<0.05. Post-hoc comparison between groups was further detected using the least significant difference (LSD) method.  Subject A total of 42 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (400 - 425 g, Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were used. Animals were divided into one normal control group (n=6) and six TBI groups (n=6×6). TBI groups include animals sacrificed 1, 4, 24, and 48 hours after trauma, and animals treated with 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) or Minocycline.

The differences among multiple groups was assessed using one-way ANOVA analysis with a significance level at p<0.05. Post-hoc comparison between groups was further detected using the least significant difference (LSD) method.  Figures and Table Figure 1 shows the significant (p<0.01, indicated by *) decrease in relative expression of synaptophysin mRNA (A) and protein (B) at 1 hour after TBI. At 4 through 48 hours after trauma, expressions of genes and proteins remain at the low level, a sign of continued synapse loss caused by TBI. Protein equal loading was indicated by intracellular protein ?-actin. Representative immunoblots are presented. Values are mean +/- SE. Figures 2 Genes coding for HIF-1? are significantly (p<0.01, indicated by *) upregulated as early as 1 hour after TBI, through 48 hours (A) . Similar to gene expression, relative protein levels of HIF-1? (B) increase a significant amount (p<0.01, indicated by *) after TBI at different time points, 1 through 48 hours. Protein equal loading was shown by intracellular protein ?-actin. Representative immunoblots are presented. Values are mean +/- SE. Figures 3 After TBI, genes coding for MMP-2 and -9 is significantly (p<0.01, indicated by *) upregulated at different time points, 24 hours for MMP-2 (A) and 4 hours for MMP-9 (B) . The increases continue at 48 hours. However, protein levels of MMP-2 (C) , and MMP-9 (D) were up-regulated (p<0.01, indicated by *) as early as 1 hour, compared to 24 and 4 hours for gene expressions. The increases continue up to 48 hours. A significant (p<0.01) initial increase in MMP-9 activity (F) 1 hour after TBI followed by a delayed but significant increase in MMP-2 activity (E) (p<0.01, indicated by *) at 24 hours are demonstrated. Both enzymes have increased activity 48 hours after TBI. Representative zymograms are shown. Figure 4 Graphs show a significant (p<0.01, indicated by *) reduction in synaptophsin of mRNA (A) and protein (B) in TBI rats, and significant reverse (p<0.01, indicated by #) in mRNA and protein expression with Minocycline or 2ME2 treatment at 4 hours after trauma. Protein equal loading was shown by intracellular protein ?-actin. Representative immunoblots are presented. Values are mean +/- SE. Figure 5 Pronounced effects of Minocycline (Mino) and 2ME2 are demonstrated on gene expression (A, B) , protein expression (C, D) , and activity (E, F) of MMP-2 and MMP-9 at 4 hours after trauma. Significant (p<0.01) increase in MMP-2 and -9 expression induced by TBI (indicated by *) was reversed by Minocycline and 2ME2, respectively (p<0.01, indicated by #). Minocycline and 2ME2 kept relative expression at or near control levels. Protein equal loading was indicated by intracellular protein ?-actin for Western blot. Representative immunoblots and zymograms are shown. Values are mean +/- SE.

One-way ANOVA analysis indicated a significantly [F(4,21)=2.930, p<0.05] decreased synaptophysin expression at 1 hour after TBI ( Fig. 1A ). Post-hoc analysis further indicated that this decrease continued through 4, 24 and 48 hours. Synaptophysin protein expression was determined by Western blot in rats with or without TBI. Compared with the normal control group, the synaptophysin protein level in the TBI group was significantly [F(4,21)=2.930, p<0.05] decreased by 34.9±0.1% ( Fig. 1B ) 1 hour after injury. Corresponding to mRNA expression, this decrease in synaptophysin protein level continued through 4, 24 and 48 hours after TBI. HIF-1? Expression and MMP Regulation After TBI HIF-1? Expression As early as 1 hour after TBI, genes encoding HIF-1? were significantly [F(4,21)=15.148, p<0.01] increased ( Fig. 2A ). This significantly increased gene expression in HIF-1? continues through 48 hours after TBI, revealed by post-hoc analysis. Corresponding with the increased gene expression, protein expression of HIF-1? determined by Western blotting analysis, was significantly increased at 1 hour after TBI through 48 hours, shown by ANOVA and post-hoc analysis [F(4,21)=2.645, p<0.05]( Fig. 2B ). MMP Expression A increase in HIF-1? was followed by a significant [F(4,21)=6.746, p<0.01] increase in MMP-9 gene expression at 4 hours ( Fig. 3C ) and MMP-2 gene expression [F(4,21)=8.159, p<0.05] at 24 hours post-TBI ( Fig. 3B ). The increased gene expression in MMP-2 and MMP-9 continues at 48 hours after TBI, revealed by post-hoc analysis. As compared with the delayed increase in gene expression of MMP-2 at 24 hours and MMP-9 at 4 hours after TBI, the protein levels were up-regulated as earlier as at 1 hour both for MMP-2 [F(4,21)=14.588, p<0.01]( Fig. 3C ), and MMP-9 [F(4,21)=6.746, p<0.01]( Fig. 3D ). These results suggest that TBI-induced HIF-1? expression not only stimulate expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 at transcript (mRNA) level, but also activates these two molecules at translation (protein) levels, causing the immediate synapse damage after TBI determined by early loss of synaptophysin (see Figure 1 ). MMP-2 and -9 enzyme activity was determined by gelatin Zymography. Corresponding with MMP-9 protein levels, one-way ANOVA analysis demonstrated a significant [F(4,21)=7.024, p<0.01] increase in MMP-9 enzyme activity in TBI rats as early as 1 hour by 77.5±23% ( Fig. 3F ). However, increased MMP-2 activity [F(4,21)=7.524, p<0.01] by 152.3±53% ( Fig. 3E ) was observed at 24 hours after injury. Post-hoc analysis showed that the MMP activity remained elevated until 48 hours after TBI. This result suggests that MMP-9 rather than MMP-2 played a pivotal role in early synapse loss and damage. It further suggests that MMP-9 activity plays a role in activation of MMP-2. Causative Roles of the HIF-1? and MMP Cascade in Synapse Loss In order to assess the key role of the HIF-1? and MMP regulatory cascade in synapse alteration after TBI, we used inhibitors of HIF-1? (2ME2) and MMPs (Minocycline), respectively. Since the over-expression of target molecules peak at 4 hours after TBI, this time point was chosen for this analysis. In contrast to the rats that received trauma but were not treated with Minocycline or 2ME2 in the TBI control group, real time PCR and Western blotting analyses showed that expression of synaptophysin reduced by TBI was significantly reversed at levels of transcription (mRNA) [F(3,18)=6.914, p<0.01]( Fig. 4A ) and translation (protein) [F(8,39)=3.684, p<0.01]( Fig. 4B ), with the reduced synaptophysin returning to normal level. Again, compared with the TBI control group without treatment, in rats after 4 hour TBI, 2ME2 treatment significantly inhibits gene expression [F(3,18)=2.448, p<0.10; F(3,18)=14.540, p<0.01], protein synthesis [F(3,18)=36.906, p<0.01; F(3,18)=18.956, p<0.01], and enzyme activity [F(3,18)=9.478, p<0.01; F(3,18)=36.518, p<0.01] for both MMP-2 ( Fig. 5A, C, E ) and MMP-9 ( Fig. 5B, D, F ), although protein levels for MMP-2 seem to be partially inhibited. As we predicted, Minocycline completely blocked MMP gene and protein expression along with activity. Post-hoc analysis showed that all changes under different conditions in expression were significant.  RESULTS Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Results in Synaptic Loss Gene expression of synaptophysin, a presynaptic vesicular protein representing an index of synapse formation, was assessed by measuring mRNA using real-time quantitative PCR. One-way ANOVA analysis indicated a significantly [F(4,21)=2.930, p<0.05] decreased synaptophysin expression at 1 hour after TBI ( Fig. 1A ). Post-hoc analysis further indicated that this decrease continued through 4, 24 and 48 hours. Synaptophysin protein expression was determined by Western blot in rats with or without TBI. Compared with the normal control group, the synaptophysin protein level in the TBI group was significantly [F(4,21)=2.930, p<0.05] decreased by 34.9±0.1% ( Fig. 1B ) 1 hour after injury. Corresponding to mRNA expression, this decrease in synaptophysin protein level continued through 4, 24 and 48 hours after TBI. HIF-1? Expression and MMP Regulation After TBI HIF-1? Expression As early as 1 hour after TBI, genes encoding HIF-1? were significantly [F(4,21)=15.148, p<0.01] increased ( Fig. 2A ). This significantly increased gene expression in HIF-1? continues through 48 hours after TBI, revealed by post-hoc analysis. Corresponding with the increased gene expression, protein expression of HIF-1? determined by Western blotting analysis, was significantly increased at 1 hour after TBI through 48 hours, shown by ANOVA and post-hoc analysis [F(4,21)=2.645, p<0.05]( Fig. 2B ). MMP Expression A increase in HIF-1? was followed by a significant [F(4,21)=6.746, p<0.01] increase in MMP-9 gene expression at 4 hours ( Fig. 3C ) and MMP-2 gene expression [F(4,21)=8.159, p<0.05] at 24 hours post-TBI ( Fig. 3B ). The increased gene expression in MMP-2 and MMP-9 continues at 48 hours after TBI, revealed by post-hoc analysis. As compared with the delayed increase in gene expression of MMP-2 at 24 hours and MMP-9 at 4 hours after TBI, the protein levels were up-regulated as earlier as at 1 hour both for MMP-2 [F(4,21)=14.588, p<0.01]( Fig. 3C ), and MMP-9 [F(4,21)=6.746, p<0.01]( Fig. 3D ). These results suggest that TBI-induced HIF-1? expression not only stimulate expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 at transcript (mRNA) level, but also activates these two molecules at translation (protein) levels, causing the immediate synapse damage after TBI determined by early loss of synaptophysin (see Figure 1 ). MMP-2 and -9 enzyme activity was determined by gelatin Zymography. Corresponding with MMP-9 protein levels, one-way ANOVA analysis demonstrated a significant [F(4,21)=7.024, p<0.01] increase in MMP-9 enzyme activity in TBI rats as early as 1 hour by 77.5±23% ( Fig. 3F ). However, increased MMP-2 activity [F(4,21)=7.524, p<0.01] by 152.3±53% ( Fig. 3E ) was observed at 24 hours after injury. Post-hoc analysis showed that the MMP activity remained elevated until 48 hours after TBI. This result suggests that MMP-9 rather than MMP-2 played a pivotal role in early synapse loss and damage. It further suggests that MMP-9 activity plays a role in activation of MMP-2. Causative Roles of the HIF-1? and MMP Cascade in Synapse Loss In order to assess the key role of the HIF-1? and MMP regulatory cascade in synapse alteration after TBI, we used inhibitors of HIF-1? (2ME2) and MMPs (Minocycline), respectively. Since the over-expression of target molecules peak at 4 hours after TBI, this time point was chosen for this analysis. In contrast to the rats that received trauma but were not treated with Minocycline or 2ME2 in the TBI control group, real time PCR and Western blotting analyses showed that expression of synaptophysin reduced by TBI was significantly reversed at levels of transcription (mRNA) [F(3,18)=6.914, p<0.01]( Fig. 4A ) and translation (protein) [F(8,39)=3.684, p<0.01]( Fig. 4B ), with the reduced synaptophysin returning to normal level. Again, compared with the TBI control group without treatment, in rats after 4 hour TBI, 2ME2 treatment significantly inhibits gene expression [F(3,18)=2.448, p<0.10; F(3,18)=14.540, p<0.01], protein synthesis [F(3,18)=36.906, p<0.01; F(3,18)=18.956, p<0.01], and enzyme activity [F(3,18)=9.478, p<0.01; F(3,18)=36.518, p<0.01] for both MMP-2 ( Fig. 5A, C, E ) and MMP-9 ( Fig. 5B, D, F ), although protein levels for MMP-2 seem to be partially inhibited. As we predicted, Minocycline completely blocked MMP gene and protein expression along with activity. Post-hoc analysis showed that all changes under different conditions in expression were significant.  Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Results in Synaptic Loss Gene expression of synaptophysin, a presynaptic vesicular protein representing an index of synapse formation, was assessed by measuring mRNA using real-time quantitative PCR. One-way ANOVA analysis indicated a significantly [F(4,21)=2.930, p<0.05] decreased synaptophysin expression at 1 hour after TBI ( Fig. 1A ). Post-hoc analysis further indicated that this decrease continued through 4, 24 and 48 hours. Synaptophysin protein expression was determined by Western blot in rats with or without TBI. Compared with the normal control group, the synaptophysin protein level in the TBI group was significantly [F(4,21)=2.930, p<0.05] decreased by 34.9±0.1% ( Fig. 1B ) 1 hour after injury. Corresponding to mRNA expression, this decrease in synaptophysin protein level continued through 4, 24 and 48 hours after TBI.  Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Results in Synaptic Loss Gene expression of synaptophysin, a presynaptic vesicular protein representing an index of synapse formation, was assessed by measuring mRNA using real-time quantitative PCR. One-way ANOVA analysis indicated a significantly [F(4,21)=2.930, p<0.05] decreased synaptophysin expression at 1 hour after TBI ( Fig. 1A ). Post-hoc analysis further indicated that this decrease continued through 4, 24 and 48 hours. Synaptophysin protein expression was determined by Western blot in rats with or without TBI. Compared with the normal control group, the synaptophysin protein level in the TBI group was significantly [F(4,21)=2.930, p<0.05] decreased by 34.9±0.1% ( Fig. 1B ) 1 hour after injury. Corresponding to mRNA expression, this decrease in synaptophysin protein level continued through 4, 24 and 48 hours after TBI.  HIF-1? Expression and MMP Regulation After TBI HIF-1? Expression As early as 1 hour after TBI, genes encoding HIF-1? were significantly [F(4,21)=15.148, p<0.01] increased ( Fig. 2A ). This significantly increased gene expression in HIF-1? continues through 48 hours after TBI, revealed by post-hoc analysis. Corresponding with the increased gene expression, protein expression of HIF-1? determined by Western blotting analysis, was significantly increased at 1 hour after TBI through 48 hours, shown by ANOVA and post-hoc analysis [F(4,21)=2.645, p<0.05]( Fig. 2B ). MMP Expression A increase in HIF-1? was followed by a significant [F(4,21)=6.746, p<0.01] increase in MMP-9 gene expression at 4 hours ( Fig. 3C ) and MMP-2 gene expression [F(4,21)=8.159, p<0.05] at 24 hours post-TBI ( Fig. 3B ). The increased gene expression in MMP-2 and MMP-9 continues at 48 hours after TBI, revealed by post-hoc analysis. As compared with the delayed increase in gene expression of MMP-2 at 24 hours and MMP-9 at 4 hours after TBI, the protein levels were up-regulated as earlier as at 1 hour both for MMP-2 [F(4,21)=14.588, p<0.01]( Fig. 3C ), and MMP-9 [F(4,21)=6.746, p<0.01]( Fig. 3D ). These results suggest that TBI-induced HIF-1? expression not only stimulate expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 at transcript (mRNA) level, but also activates these two molecules at translation (protein) levels, causing the immediate synapse damage after TBI determined by early loss of synaptophysin (see Figure 1 ). MMP-2 and -9 enzyme activity was determined by gelatin Zymography. Corresponding with MMP-9 protein levels, one-way ANOVA analysis demonstrated a significant [F(4,21)=7.024, p<0.01] increase in MMP-9 enzyme activity in TBI rats as early as 1 hour by 77.5±23% ( Fig. 3F ). However, increased MMP-2 activity [F(4,21)=7.524, p<0.01] by 152.3±53% ( Fig. 3E ) was observed at 24 hours after injury. Post-hoc analysis showed that the MMP activity remained elevated until 48 hours after TBI. This result suggests that MMP-9 rather than MMP-2 played a pivotal role in early synapse loss and damage. It further suggests that MMP-9 activity plays a role in activation of MMP-2.  HIF-1? Expression and MMP Regulation After TBI HIF-1? Expression As early as 1 hour after TBI, genes encoding HIF-1? were significantly [F(4,21)=15.148, p<0.01] increased ( Fig. 2A ). This significantly increased gene expression in HIF-1? continues through 48 hours after TBI, revealed by post-hoc analysis. Corresponding with the increased gene expression, protein expression of HIF-1? determined by Western blotting analysis, was significantly increased at 1 hour after TBI through 48 hours, shown by ANOVA and post-hoc analysis [F(4,21)=2.645, p<0.05]( Fig. 2B ). MMP Expression A increase in HIF-1? was followed by a significant [F(4,21)=6.746, p<0.01] increase in MMP-9 gene expression at 4 hours ( Fig. 3C ) and MMP-2 gene expression [F(4,21)=8.159, p<0.05] at 24 hours post-TBI ( Fig. 3B ). The increased gene expression in MMP-2 and MMP-9 continues at 48 hours after TBI, revealed by post-hoc analysis. As compared with the delayed increase in gene expression of MMP-2 at 24 hours and MMP-9 at 4 hours after TBI, the protein levels were up-regulated as earlier as at 1 hour both for MMP-2 [F(4,21)=14.588, p<0.01]( Fig. 3C ), and MMP-9 [F(4,21)=6.746, p<0.01]( Fig. 3D ). These results suggest that TBI-induced HIF-1? expression not only stimulate expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 at transcript (mRNA) level, but also activates these two molecules at translation (protein) levels, causing the immediate synapse damage after TBI determined by early loss of synaptophysin (see Figure 1 ). MMP-2 and -9 enzyme activity was determined by gelatin Zymography. Corresponding with MMP-9 protein levels, one-way ANOVA analysis demonstrated a significant [F(4,21)=7.024, p<0.01] increase in MMP-9 enzyme activity in TBI rats as early as 1 hour by 77.5±23% ( Fig. 3F ).

Corresponding with the increased gene expression, protein expression of HIF-1? determined by Western blotting analysis, was significantly increased at 1 hour after TBI through 48 hours, shown by ANOVA and post-hoc analysis [F(4,21)=2.645, p<0.05]( Fig. 2B ).  HIF-1? Expression As early as 1 hour after TBI, genes encoding HIF-1? were significantly [F(4,21)=15.148, p<0.01] increased ( Fig. 2A ).

MMP Expression A increase in HIF-1? was followed by a significant [F(4,21)=6.746, p<0.01] increase in MMP-9 gene expression at 4 hours ( Fig. 3C ) and MMP-2 gene expression [F(4,21)=8.159, p<0.05] at 24 hours post-TBI ( Fig. 3B ). The increased gene expression in MMP-2 and MMP-9 continues at 48 hours after TBI, revealed by post-hoc analysis. As compared with the delayed increase in gene expression of MMP-2 at 24 hours and MMP-9 at 4 hours after TBI, the protein levels were up-regulated as earlier as at 1 hour both for MMP-2 [F(4,21)=14.588, p<0.01]( Fig. 3C ), and MMP-9 [F(4,21)=6.746, p<0.01]( Fig. 3D ). These results suggest that TBI-induced HIF-1? expression not only stimulate expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 at transcript (mRNA) level, but also activates these two molecules at translation (protein) levels, causing the immediate synapse damage after TBI determined by early loss of synaptophysin (see Figure 1 ). MMP-2 and -9 enzyme activity was determined by gelatin Zymography.

Again, compared with the TBI control group without treatment, in rats after 4 hour TBI, 2ME2 treatment significantly inhibits gene expression [F(3,18)=2.448, p<0.10; F(3,18)=14.540, p<0.01], protein synthesis [F(3,18)=36.906, p<0.01; F(3,18)=18.956, p<0.01], and enzyme activity [F(3,18)=9.478, p<0.01; F(3,18)=36.518, p<0.01] for both MMP-2 ( Fig. 5A, C, E ) and MMP-9 ( Fig. 5B, D, F ), although protein levels for MMP-2 seem to be partially inhibited. As we predicted, Minocycline completely blocked MMP gene and protein expression along with activity. Post-hoc analysis showed that all changes under different conditions in expression were significant.

As we predicted, Minocycline completely blocked MMP gene and protein expression along with activity. Post-hoc analysis showed that all changes under different conditions in expression were significant.  DISCUSSION This study demonstrates that closed head traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes synapse loss/damage shown by decreased synaptophysin expression at both transcription (gene expression) and translation (protein synthesis) levels. In addition, we have shown that the Marmarou model of TBI induces up-regulation of HIF-1?. The synapse loss is temporally associated with HIF-1? and MMP over-expression. The reversal of reduced synaptophysin after inhibition of HIF-1? and MMPs and the reversal of increased MMPs after inhibition of HIF-1? further suggest that HIF-1? is an upstream factor and causatively up-regulates MMP expression at levels of transcription, translation and enzyme activity, which in turn, causes synapse loss. Synaptophysin is a 38-kDa calcium binding glycoprotein found in the membranes of presynaptic vesicles in neurons ( Navone et al., 1986 ; Wiedenmann and Franke, 1985 ) and is involved in vesicular trafficking, docking, and fusion of the synaptic plasma membrane ( Sudhof, 1995 ). It is located close to the actual synapses, though not in the synaptic cleft. Synaptophysin has been widely used as a marker protein to quantify numbers of synapses during neuroanatomical remodeling (i.e. synaptic plasticity) or following injury ( Brock and O'Callaghan, 1987 ; Meng et al., 2006 ). In this study, synaptophysin was used to measure synapse loss after TBI. TBI diminished memory and cognition skills ( Carney et al., 1999 ; Scott-Jupp et al., 1992 ; Taylor et al., 1999 ), as well as behavioral changes and health problems in soldiers that have been injured in combat ( French and Parkinson, 2008 ; Hoge et al., 2008 ). TBI- induced synaptic loss observed in the present study could result in those behavioral, cognitive and neurological deficits. This synaptic loss seen was supported by previous findings that TBI causes significant synapse loss in the hippocampal CA1 region at 2 days post-injury by 60% ( Scheff et al., 2005 ). After 60 days post-injury, total synapse numbers had approached pre-injury levels but were still significantly lowered. The present study also attempts to elucidate the mechanism underlying synapse loss after TBI. MMPs, a family of zinc dependent proteases responsible for the extracellular matrix turnover and degradation of bioactive proteins, are expressed in the developing, healthy adult and diseased central nervous system (CNS) ( Agrawal et al., 2008 ). MMPs, divided into five classes including gelatinases (MMP-2 and -9)( Lo et al., 2003 ), play roles in regulation of neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis during CNS development and in the healthy adult CNS, such as in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Under pathological conditions such as focal and global ischemia, MMPs disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and contribute to the neuroinflammatory response in neurological diseases ( Le et al., 2007 ), and cause brain cell death ( Gu et al., 2002 ; Gu et al., 2005 ; Wang et al., 2000 ; Truettner et al., 2005 ). A recent study has indicated that changes in MMP function are critical to synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent learning ( Meighan et al., 2006 ). Motor outcomes after TBI was found to be associated with MMP expression, and MMP-9 knock-out mice had less motor deficits than wild-type mice ( Wang et al., 2000 ). To the best of our knowledge, the present study demonstrated, for the first time, that an up-regulation of MMP-2 and -9 plays a pivotal role in synapse loss after TBI. Inhibition of MMPs with Minocycline completely blocked the detrimental effect of TBI on synapse loss determined by synaptophysin expressions. In addition, we found that MMP-9 gene expression and activity were up-regulated before MMP-2, suggesting a temporal sequence in the activation of the two proteinases. The same temporal pattern has been found by other groups ( Truettner et al., 2005 ). TBI increased MMP-9 levels in cortical and hippocampal regions early at 4 hours post-TBI, persisting for 5 days. Late increases in MMP-2 levels were observed at 1, 3, and 5 days after TBI. Although the pathway of activation and inhibition of MMPs is complex, these studies suggest that early rise of MMP-9 may be involved in MMP-2 activation. Furthermore, our study demonstrates, for the first time, that expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 can be inhibited by blocking HIF-1? function with 2ME2, in association with a reversal of synapse loss caused by TBI. The study suggests that synapse loss following TBI could be modulated by levels of HIF-1?. It has been reported that hypoxia, which is associated with alterations in energy metabolism, negatively impacts synaptic plasticity and cognitive function ( Wu et al., 2004a ; Wu et al., 2004b ; Vaynman et al., 2006 ; Wu et al., 2006 ). The present study suggests that HIF-1?, greatly upregulated during hypoxia, may be an important component of this injury cascade. HIF-1? is a subunit of HIF-1, a heterodimeric transcription factor containing an inducible HIF-1? subunit and a constitutive HIF-1? subunit. HIF-1? is an oxygen sensor that plays a central role in the maintenance of oxygen homeostasis in body tissues ( Semenza, 2000 ; Semenza, 1999 ). Under normoxic conditions, the HIF-1? protein is expressed at very low levels due to rapid ubiquination and proteasomal degradation ( Jaakkola et al., 2001 ). When oxygen is not present, though, the chemical pathway that degrades it cannot operate, so the protein rapidly accumulates ( Wang et al., 1995 ). HIF-1? can be up-regulated under pathologic conditions such as hypoxia or ischemia due to the inhibition of degradation ( Li et al., 2008 ; Mu et al., 2003 ). It is believed that oxygen tension plays a crucial role in the activation of HIF-1?. Although HIF-1? up-regulation has been extensively studied in ischemia/reperfusion injury after stroke, the present study demonstrated an over-expression of HIF-1? during the early post-TBI period. This study also supports a key role of HIF-1? in causing synapse loss after TBI by administration of the HIF-1? inhibitor 2ME2. As such, when 2ME2 was given to the rats thirty minutes following TBI, it reversed synapse loss caused by TBI, via MMP expression. The roles of HIF-1? in up-regulating MMP expression and of MMPs in reversing loss of synapses after TBI were elucidated in the present study. Although the present study suggests a harmful role of HIF-1? in causing synapse loss via MMP activation, the protective potential of HIF-1? under pathological conditions cannot be ignored. As described in a recent review ( Ratan et al., 2007 ), as many as 70 genes can be regulated by HIF-1-? Genes like erythropoietin (Epo), its receptor (EpoR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), heme oxygenase, glycolytic enzymes - all have been shown to exert neuroprotection in numerous models of brain injury including surviving neurons after stroke ( Ratan et al., 2007 ) and in a model of closed head injury ( Shein et al., 2005 ). Thus, the effect of upregulation of HIF-? cannot be only as a “harmful” event, but also as a trophic event. Moreover, it has been shown by Haddad and colleagues ( Haddad and Land, 2001 ; Haddad and Harb, 2005 ) that inflammatory cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor, TNF-? and interleukin-1?, IL-1?) can also mediate the translocation of HIF-1?, associated with up-regulating its activity under normoxia. Along these lines, a recent study ( Bye et al., 2007 ) reported that in a TBI protection by Minocycline is associated with a selective anti-inflammatory response, and that microglial activation and IL-1? expression are reduced. Thus, since upregulation of TNF-? and IL-1?is among the very early events in TBI, we cannot rule out that the combined effects of hypoxia and inflammation, and also probably metabolic dysfunction contribute to activation of HIF1-?, instead of being solely due to chronic hypoxia. In summary, the present study shows a HIF-1? - MMP signaling cascade in which TBI first triggers induction of HIF-1?, which, in turn, up-regulates MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression, leading to pathophysiologic loss of synapses as indicated by down-regulation of synaptophysin. Further understanding on outcome of motor and cognitive function and on exact mechanisms of the HIF-1?-MMP pathway underlying synapse damage may provide insights into post-TBI neurological deficits. Those findings could enhance our effort for preventing the secondary progression of damage after brain trauma.  DISCUSSION This study demonstrates that closed head traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes synapse loss/damage shown by decreased synaptophysin expression at both transcription (gene expression) and translation (protein synthesis) levels. In addition, we have shown that the Marmarou model of TBI induces up-regulation of HIF-1?. The synapse loss is temporally associated with HIF-1? and MMP over-expression. The reversal of reduced synaptophysin after inhibition of HIF-1? and MMPs and the reversal of increased MMPs after inhibition of HIF-1? further suggest that HIF-1? is an upstream factor and causatively up-regulates MMP expression at levels of transcription, translation and enzyme activity, which in turn, causes synapse loss.

It is believed that oxygen tension plays a crucial role in the activation of HIF-1?. Although HIF-1? up-regulation has been extensively studied in ischemia/reperfusion injury after stroke, the present study demonstrated an over-expression of HIF-1? during the early post-TBI period. This study also supports a key role of HIF-1? in causing synapse loss after TBI by administration of the HIF-1? inhibitor 2ME2. As such, when 2ME2 was given to the rats thirty minutes following TBI, it reversed synapse loss caused by TBI, via MMP expression. The roles of HIF-1? in up-regulating MMP expression and of MMPs in reversing loss of synapses after TBI were elucidated in the present study. Although the present study suggests a harmful role of HIF-1? in causing synapse loss via MMP activation, the protective potential of HIF-1? under pathological conditions cannot be ignored. As described in a recent review ( Ratan et al., 2007 ), as many as 70 genes can be regulated by HIF-1-? Genes like erythropoietin (Epo), its receptor (EpoR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), heme oxygenase, glycolytic enzymes - all have been shown to exert neuroprotection in numerous models of brain injury including surviving neurons after stroke ( Ratan et al., 2007 ) and in a model of closed head injury ( Shein et al., 2005 ). Thus, the effect of upregulation of HIF-? cannot be only as a “harmful” event, but also as a trophic event. Moreover, it has been shown by Haddad and colleagues ( Haddad and Land, 2001 ; Haddad and Harb, 2005 ) that inflammatory cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor, TNF-? and interleukin-1?, IL-1?) can also mediate the translocation of HIF-1?, associated with up-regulating its activity under normoxia. Along these lines, a recent study ( Bye et al., 2007 ) reported that in a TBI protection by Minocycline is associated with a selective anti-inflammatory response, and that microglial activation and IL-1? expression are reduced. Thus, since upregulation of TNF-? and IL-1?is among the very early events in TBI, we cannot rule out that the combined effects of hypoxia and inflammation, and also probably metabolic dysfunction contribute to activation of HIF1-?, instead of being solely due to chronic hypoxia. In summary, the present study shows a HIF-1? - MMP signaling cascade in which TBI first triggers induction of HIF-1?, which, in turn, up-regulates MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression, leading to pathophysiologic loss of synapses as indicated by down-regulation of synaptophysin. Further understanding on outcome of motor and cognitive function and on exact mechanisms of the HIF-1?-MMP pathway underlying synapse damage may provide insights into post-TBI neurological deficits. Those findings could enhance our effort for preventing the secondary progression of damage after brain trauma.
