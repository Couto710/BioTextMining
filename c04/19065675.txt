Deficiency in regulatory T cells results in development of antimitochondrial antibodies and autoimmune cholangitis There have been several descriptions of mouse models that manifest select immunological and clinical features of autoimmune cholangitis with similarities to primary biliary cirrhosis in humans. Some of these models require immunization with complete Freund's adjuvant, whereas others suggest that a decreased frequency of T regulatory cells (Tregs) facilitate spontaneous disease. We hypothesized that anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) and development of autoimmune cholangitis would be found in mice genetically deficient in components essential for the development and homeostasis of Foxp3+ Tregs. Therefore, we examined Scurfy (Sf) mice, animals that have a mutation in the gene encoding the Foxp3 transcription factor which results in a complete abolition of Foxp3+ Tregs. Indeed at 3-4 weeks of age, 100% of animals manifest high titer serum AMA of all isotypes. Further, mice have moderate to severe lymphocytic infiltrates surrounding portal areas with evidence of biliary duct damage, and dramatic elevation of cytokines in serum and mRNAs encoding cytokines in liver tissue, including TNF-?, IFN-?, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23. In conclusion, the lack of functional Foxp3 is a major predisposing feature for loss of tolerance that leads to autoimmune cholangitis. These findings reflect on the importance of regulatory T cells in other murine models as well as in patients with PBC.  Materials and Methods Mice Heterozygous female B6.Cg- foxp3 sf/X/J mice obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) were bred with male C57BL/6J mice to generate hemizygous foxp3 sf/Y Scurfy (Sf) mice. All animals were maintained in individually ventilated cages under specific pathogen-free conditions in our animal facility. Mice with the Foxp3 mutation were identified by PCR genotyping ( 19 , 20 ). Due to the fact that Sf phenotype occurs in hemizygous males and XO females ( 21 ), hemizygous male mice with mutated Foxp3 gene ( foxp3 sf/Y ) were used herein. Male mice with wildtype Foxp3 gene ( foxp3 X/Y ) were used as controls. Since Foxp3 deficient male mice have 100% mortality by four weeks of age, all experiments were performed at 3-4 wks of age. All animal experiments were approved by the Universities of California and Virginia Animal Care Committees. Experimental protocol Mice were left unmanipulated until 3 to 4 weeks of age. At that time all animals were sacrificed; 4-12 mice were used in each group. Sera were obtained for serum antibody and cytokine tests. Livers were used for isolating RNA to determine cytokine mRNA levels and for histological studies. Liver and spleens were used for flow cytometric analysis of lymphocytes. We note that other tissues have been previously studied by other groups ( 20 , 22 - 25 ). Serum anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) The level of AMA was measured with ELISA, using recombinant PDC-E2 as the test antigen following previous described procedures ( 16 , 26 ). Cytokine analysis Concentrations of TNF-?, IFN-?, IL-6, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 in sera were measured with the mouse inflammatory Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) kit or the mouse Th1/Th2 cytokine CBA kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Serum IL-12p40 was measured using mouse IL-12/IL-23 p40 allele-specific DuoSet ELISA development kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Serum IL-18 was measured using mouse IL-18 ELISA kit (Medical & Biological Laboratories CO. Ltd, Japan). Total RNA was extracted using the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 1 ?g of total RNA was reverse transcribed and then quantified on an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System. Amplification was performed for 40 cycles in a total volume of 20 ?l and products detected using SYBR Green. The relative expression level of each target gene was determined by normalizing its mRNA level to an internal control gene GAPDH ( Table 1 ). Flow Cytometry Mononuclear cells were isolated from spleen and liver tissues using density gradient centrifugation with Accu-Paque (Density: 1.086). Anti-mouse CD16/32 (clone 93, Biolegend) were used for FcR blocking. Mononuclear cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugate antibodies, including Alexa Fluor 750 conjugated anti-TCR-? (clone H57-597, eBiosciences), Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated anti-CD19 (clone eBio1 D3, eBiosciences), PerCP conjugated anti-CD4 (clone RM4-5, Biolegend), FITC conjugated anti-CD8a (clone 53-6.7, Biolegend), and PE conjugated anti-NK1.1 (clone PK136, BD-PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Stained cells were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer to allow for five-color analysis. Data were analyzed with CELLQUEST software (BD Bioscience). Histochemistry of liver Sections of liver tissue were immediately fixed with 10% buffered formalin at room temperature for 2 days, then embedded in paraffin and cut into 5-?m slices for staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or for immunostaining. For phenotypic analysis of the lymphocytic filtrates, rat anti-mouse CD4 (1:30 dilution, clone L3T4, eBioscience, San Diego, CA), anti-mouse CD8 (1:30 dilution, Ly-2, clone 53.6.7, eBioscience) and anti-mouse IFN-? (1:30 dilution, clone R4-6A2, Biolegend, San Diego, CA) antibodies were used for immunostaining as described in our previous publication ( 27 ). Statistical Analysis The data were shown as mean ± SEM. Two-sample comparisons were carried out with two-sided unpaired t-test. Attained significance levels of p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

Attained significance levels of p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.  Results Sf mice develop PDC-E2 specific AMA Sf mice display significantly elevated IgG, IgA and IgM reactivity against PDC-E2 than their littermate controls (IgG and IgM, p < 0.001; IgA, p < 0.01, Figure 1 ). Increased circulating inflammatory cytokines in Sf mice he levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-?, IFN-?, IL-6, IL-12p40 and IL-18 were significantly elevated in the sera of Sf mice compared with their littermate controls (TNF-?, p < 0.001; IFN-?, p < 0.05; IL-6, IL-12p40 and IL-18, p < 0.01) ( Figure 2 ). The mean serum concentration of IL-10 in Sf mice was higher than the control mice (27.0 ± 12.1 pg/ml versus 2.4 ± 2.4 pg/ml), although the difference was not statistically significant ( p > 0.05). Up-regulated hepatic mRNA levels for inflammatory cytokines and related transcription factors in Sf mice The inflammatory cytokines TNF-?, IFN-? and IL-6 were up-regulated 10-20 folds in Sf compared to control mice (IFN-?, p < 0.05; TNF-? and IL-6, p < 0.001, Figure 2 ). The Th1-associated cytokine IL-12p40 gene was also significant higher in the Sf mice than controls ( p < 0.001). In contrast to the increased level of IL-18 in the serum of Sf mice than controls, such a difference was not seen in liver (data not shown). TGF-? mRNA was expressed six-fold higher in Sf versus control mice ( p < 0.01), while IL-17A and its key transcription factor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor ?t (ROR ?t) were both elevated at similar levels in the liver of Sf mice ( p < 0.01). A similar increase was also observed in Th1-specific T box transcription factor (T-bet) in Sf compared with control mice ( p < 0.001). Interestingly, IL-23 mRNA was presented at an extremely high level in Sf livers which was approximately 200- to 300-fold greater than that of control mice ( p < 0.001, Figure 3 ). Sf mice exhibit PBC-like portal inflammation and bile duct damage In Sf mice, clusters of lympho-plasma cells aggregated in the parenchyma and most of portal tracts in association with bile duct damage ( Figure 4A-4D ). Necroinflammatory changes to various degrees were also observed in hepatic parenchyma ( Figure 4E and 4F ). In the hepatic parenchyma of Sf mice, neutrophils, eosinophils and histiocytes were also seen ( Figure 4G and 4H ). Entrapped hepatocytes and interface hepatitis were observed in cellularly enlarged portal tracts, suggesting that portal inflammation progressed rapidly. Interlobular bile ducts were surrounded by inflammatory cells and showed degenerative changes ( Figure 4C-4E ). In several bile ducts, epithelial destruction with intraepithelial lymphoid infiltration was observed ( Figure 5A and 5B ). These findings were similar to the chronic nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis aspects of human PBC. To highlight the shape of interlobular bile ducts among inflammatory cells, immunohistochemical staining with pan-keratin cocktails antibodies was performed and shown in Figure 5C and 5D . Scattered cytokeratin positive cells were observed in the portal infiltrates and direct bile duct destruction in 11 out of 12 liver tissues from Sf mice. Moreover, bile duct loss was identified in several portal tracts of Sf mice. Bile ducts disappeared in portal tracts where only proliferative bile ductules remain ( Figure 5D ), similar to that observed in human PBC. Predominance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in hepatic lymphocytic infiltrate populations of Sf mice To investigate the phenotypes of liver infiltrating lymphocytes, liver sections were stained for CD4, CD8 or IFN-?. As shown in Figure 6A , CD4+ cells distributed diffusely in portal tracts, and a few CD4+ cells were found around the periductal area. Aggregated lymphocytes in the hepatic parenchyma were also positive for CD4 staining. In contrast, CD8+ cells concentrated near bile ducts and interface areas, while the IFN-?+ cells also aggregated near interlobular bile ducts. The frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the liver infiltrates and the spleens were further assessed by flow cytometry ( Figure 6B ). In both the liver and the spleen, the percentage of TCR?+ T cells in total lymphocytes was substantially higher in the Sf mice than controls. The liver infiltrating T cells from the B6 normal controls were predominantly CD4+ T cells; in contrast, those derived from the Sf mice were predominantly CD8+ T cells. A similar prevalence of CD8+ T cells was also observed in the splenocytes of Sf mice.

Discussion Although the etiology of PBC remains enigmatic, there have been several studies which suggest a role for environmental factors in initiating loss of tolerance superimposed on a genetic predisposition ( 13 , 28 - 33 ). Previously we reported that the frequency of CD4+CD25+ Tregs was reduced in PBC patients and their first-degree relatives ( 14 ). In addition, we demonstrated that PBC-like liver lesions developed in a CD25 (IL-2 receptor) deficient child ( 15 ) and in CD25-deficient mice ( 16 ), suggesting a role of Treg deficiency in the induction of PBC. In the current study we took advantage of the Sf mouse model with a mutated Foxp3 gene and carried out a systematic analyses with serologic, histological, flow cytometric and molecular approaches for the consequence of disrupting this key functional protein of Tregs. We demonstrate that at a very early stage of life Sf mice spontaneously develop characteristics of human PBC ( Table 2 ). Evidence indicate a genetic predisposition to PBC. First, there is up to a 100-fold higher risk of developing PBC in the family members of a PBC patient. Second, the concordance rate of PBC in genetically identical twin sets is 0.63 ( 34 ). Third, a higher frequency of monosomy X in women with PBC suggests that specific X chromosome-linked genes for immunoregulatory proteins are critical for PBC ( 13 , 35 ). The disorder in immune regulation of the Sf mouse is caused by a recessive mutation of the Foxp3 gene on X-chromosome. Several other mouse models with defined or undefined mutations resulting in spontaneously developed PBC-like liver diseases have been reported, including the role of xenobiotics ( 27 , 36 - 39 ). Characterization of the common phenotypes of these models will be critical to elucidate individual mechanisms that lead to autoimmune cholangitis. The specificity of pathological changes localized to the bile ducts, the presence of lymphoid infiltration in the portal tracts, and the readily detectable expression of MHC antigens on the biliary epithelium suggest that autoantigen-specific T cell responses are directed against biliary epithelial cells. Our laboratory has accumulated substantial data suggesting that the destruction of biliary cells is mediated by liver-infiltrating autoreactive T cells, especially cytotoxic CD8 T cells highly enriched in PBC liver ( 40 , 41 ). In another mouse model of PBC, CD8 T cells composed a majority of lymphocytic infiltrates in the diseased liver and were sufficient for inducing bile duct destruction after adoptive transfer ( 42 ). Consistent with these previous studies, we demonstrated here that CD8+ cells were the predominant T cell subset in liver infiltrating lymphocytes, which aggregated near bile ducts and interface areas at high frequencies. Taken together, our data suggest that the lack of Foxp3 protein results in abnormal Treg function, which is responsible for the loss of tolerance in the liver leading to autoreactive CD8 T cell-mediated bile duct damage. Although AMA is detected in 90% - 95% of PBC patients and is considered a humoral hallmark of PBC, the pathological role of AMA has not been established. Similar to other previously described murine models for PBC with different underlying gene mutations ( 36 ), in Sf mice the PBC-like liver disease is again associated with presence of serum AMAs. It is possible that AMA is an active player in the pathological process of bile duct destruction. A potential mechanism is the formation of AMA-autoantigen immune complexes, which are efficiently presented by DCs or biliary epithelial cells to activate auto-reactive cytotoxic CD8 T cells ( 40 , 43 ). Alternatively, AMA could be a mere marker for liver damage resulting from diverse etiologies ranging from autoimmune diseases to viral infection. We note that elevated serum IgM has already been reported in the original description of scurfy mice and therefore sera immunoglobulin levels were not studied herein ( 18 ). Increased expression levels of IFN-?, TNF-? and IL-6 have been demonstrated in the livers of PBC patients ( 44 - 46 ). In the current study we observed elevated hepatic expression of cytokine genes including TNF-?, IFN-?, IL-6, IL-12, TGF-?, IL-17 and IL-23, indicating the involvement of IFN-?-secreting Th1 and IL-17-secreting Th17 cells in liver damage. Previous studies have linked abnormal expression of IL-12 with expansion of naïve T cells and auto-reactive T cells leading to the breakdown of self-tolerance and exacerbation of autoimmune pathology ( 47 , 48 ). IL-12 is primarily produced by antigen presenting cells such as activated DCs, monocytes and macrophages. Increased expression of IL-12 was found in serum, cerebrospinal fluid and plaques of MS patients ( 49 - 52 ) and in synovial tissue of RA patients ( 53 ). In mice, high level of IL-12 was associated with a number of experimental autoimmune disease models ( 54 , 55 ). We also observed similar results in previous studies of murine models for PBC, including IL-2 receptor ? deficient mice ( 16 ) and TGF-? receptor II dominant-negative mice ( 56 ). Here we reported that in Sf mice, the PBC-like serological and pathological alteration is associated with elevated levels of serum IL-12 and in particular elevated levels of IL-12p40 mRNA transcripts in the liver. It will be important to further investigate whether the pathogenic process of bile duct destruction is directly induced by IL-12, or by specific immune cell subsets such as autoreactive CD8 T cells that are activated by IL-12.  Discussion Although the etiology of PBC remains enigmatic, there have been several studies which suggest a role for environmental factors in initiating loss of tolerance superimposed on a genetic predisposition ( 13 , 28 - 33 ). Previously we reported that the frequency of CD4+CD25+ Tregs was reduced in PBC patients and their first-degree relatives ( 14 ). In addition, we demonstrated that PBC-like liver lesions developed in a CD25 (IL-2 receptor) deficient child ( 15 ) and in CD25-deficient mice ( 16 ), suggesting a role of Treg deficiency in the induction of PBC. In the current study we took advantage of the Sf mouse model with a mutated Foxp3 gene and carried out a systematic analyses with serologic, histological, flow cytometric and molecular approaches for the consequence of disrupting this key functional protein of Tregs. We demonstrate that at a very early stage of life Sf mice spontaneously develop characteristics of human PBC ( Table 2 ). Evidence indicate a genetic predisposition to PBC. First, there is up to a 100-fold higher risk of developing PBC in the family members of a PBC patient. Second, the concordance rate of PBC in genetically identical twin sets is 0.63 ( 34 ). Third, a higher frequency of monosomy X in women with PBC suggests that specific X chromosome-linked genes for immunoregulatory proteins are critical for PBC ( 13 , 35 ). The disorder in immune regulation of the Sf mouse is caused by a recessive mutation of the Foxp3 gene on X-chromosome. Several other mouse models with defined or undefined mutations resulting in spontaneously developed PBC-like liver diseases have been reported, including the role of xenobiotics ( 27 , 36 - 39 ). Characterization of the common phenotypes of these models will be critical to elucidate individual mechanisms that lead to autoimmune cholangitis. The specificity of pathological changes localized to the bile ducts, the presence of lymphoid infiltration in the portal tracts, and the readily detectable expression of MHC antigens on the biliary epithelium suggest that autoantigen-specific T cell responses are directed against biliary epithelial cells. Our laboratory has accumulated substantial data suggesting that the destruction of biliary cells is mediated by liver-infiltrating autoreactive T cells, especially cytotoxic CD8 T cells highly enriched in PBC liver ( 40 , 41 ). In another mouse model of PBC, CD8 T cells composed a majority of lymphocytic infiltrates in the diseased liver and were sufficient for inducing bile duct destruction after adoptive transfer ( 42 ). Consistent with these previous studies, we demonstrated here that CD8+ cells were the predominant T cell subset in liver infiltrating lymphocytes, which aggregated near bile ducts and interface areas at high frequencies. Taken together, our data suggest that the lack of Foxp3 protein results in abnormal Treg function, which is responsible for the loss of tolerance in the liver leading to autoreactive CD8 T cell-mediated bile duct damage. Although AMA is detected in 90% - 95% of PBC patients and is considered a humoral hallmark of PBC, the pathological role of AMA has not been established. Similar to other previously described murine models for PBC with different underlying gene mutations ( 36 ), in Sf mice the PBC-like liver disease is again associated with presence of serum AMAs. It is possible that AMA is an active player in the pathological process of bile duct destruction. A potential mechanism is the formation of AMA-autoantigen immune complexes, which are efficiently presented by DCs or biliary epithelial cells to activate auto-reactive cytotoxic CD8 T cells ( 40 , 43 ). Alternatively, AMA could be a mere marker for liver damage resulting from diverse etiologies ranging from autoimmune diseases to viral infection. We note that elevated serum IgM has already been reported in the original description of scurfy mice and therefore sera immunoglobulin levels were not studied herein ( 18 ). Increased expression levels of IFN-?, TNF-? and IL-6 have been demonstrated in the livers of PBC patients ( 44 - 46 ). In the current study we observed elevated hepatic expression of cytokine genes including TNF-?, IFN-?, IL-6, IL-12, TGF-?, IL-17 and IL-23, indicating the involvement of IFN-?-secreting Th1 and IL-17-secreting Th17 cells in liver damage. Previous studies have linked abnormal expression of IL-12 with expansion of naïve T cells and auto-reactive T cells leading to the breakdown of self-tolerance and exacerbation of autoimmune pathology ( 47 , 48 ). IL-12 is primarily produced by antigen presenting cells such as activated DCs, monocytes and macrophages. Increased expression of IL-12 was found in serum, cerebrospinal fluid and plaques of MS patients ( 49 - 52 ) and in synovial tissue of RA patients ( 53 ). In mice, high level of IL-12 was associated with a number of experimental autoimmune disease models ( 54 , 55 ). We also observed similar results in previous studies of murine models for PBC, including IL-2 receptor ? deficient mice ( 16 ) and TGF-? receptor II dominant-negative mice ( 56 ). Here we reported that in Sf mice, the PBC-like serological and pathological alteration is associated with elevated levels of serum IL-12 and in particular elevated levels of IL-12p40 mRNA transcripts in the liver. It will be important to further investigate whether the pathogenic process of bile duct destruction is directly induced by IL-12, or by specific immune cell subsets such as autoreactive CD8 T cells that are activated by IL-12.
