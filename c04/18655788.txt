Hoxc6 is overexpressed in gastrointestinal carcinoids and interacts with JunD to regulate tumor growth Background and Aims The molecular alterations that underlie carcinoid tumor pathogenesis remain poorly defined. The homeobox gene Hoxc6 was highly upregulated in human gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors, and we sought to define its pathogenic role. Methods The functional and physical properties of Hoxc6 were investigated by establishing carcinoid cells that stably overexpressed Hoxc6 or were deficient in Hoxc6. Cellular proliferation assays, luciferase reporter assays, western blotting, immunoprecipitation, DNA affinity precipitation, and DNA microarray studies were performed Results Expression of Hoxc6 in cultured human BON1 carcinoid cells enhanced their proliferation, and knock-down of Hoxc6 inhibited their growth. Hoxc6 activated the oncogenic AP-1 signaling pathway through a physical interaction with JunD. Mutations in the homeodomain of Hoxc6 blocked this interaction and inhibited proliferation of carcinoid cells. Of note, Hoxc6 induced the expression of genes that are characteristically upregulated in carcinoid tumors, including neurotensin (NT) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Conclusions A novel molecular pathway has been identified that links Hoxc6 with oncogenic signaling through the AP-1 pathway in carcinoid tumorigenesis.  Materials and methods Quantitative PCR and RT-PCR RNA from eleven carcinoid tumors ( Table 1 ), eight pancreatic endocrine tumors, two samples of normal ileum, and six of normal pancreas were was isolated using the RNeasy Protect Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Reverse transcription was performed using the SuperScript III platinum Two-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen). The primers for Hoxc6 variant 1 (Hoxc6-V1) were; sense 5?-CCTTCCTTATCCTGCCACCT-3?, antisense 5?-GCTGGAACTGAACACGACAT-3? (NM_004503). The primers for Hoxc6 variant 2 (Hoxc6-V2) were; sense 5?-CTCCTCTCTCCCAGGCTCTT-3?, antisense 5?-GCTGCTGTCACTCTCCCTCT-3? (NM_153693). The primers for Hoxc8 were; sense 5?-CTCAGGCTACCAGCAGAACC-3?, antisense 5?-TTGGCGGAGGATTTACAGTC-3? (NM_022658). 18S rRNA served as an endogenous control. PCR cycles were: 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles with an annealing temperature of 60°C. A fluorogenic SYBR Green and MJ research detection system were used for real time quantification. Primer sequences for neurotensin (NT), peptide YY (PYY), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) are available upon request. The results were presented as parameter threshold cycle (CT) values. ?CT was the difference in the CT values derived from the specific gene being assayed and 18S rRNA while ??CT represented the difference between the paired samples, as calculated by the formula ??CT = ?CT of a sample ??CT of a reference. The amount of target, normalized to 18S and relative to a reference, was expressed as 2 ???CT. Stable cell lines BON1 cells (a human pancreatic carcinoid cell line) were utilized to generate cells stably overexpressing Hoxc6-Variant1, Hoxc6-Variant 2, or an siRNA to Hoxc6. These stable cells are designated BON-Flag control, BON-Hoxc6-V1, BON-Hoxc6-V2, BON-si Hoxc6, and two independent clones of each construct were analyzed. The pCMV FLAG-tag expression vector (Invitrogen) with the coding region of the human Hoxc6 variant 1 (NM_004503) or variant 2 (NM_153693) inserted between the BamHI and XhoI sites was transfected into BON1 cells. The cDNA of Hoxc6 V1 and V2 were a kind gift of Carlos Moreno (Emory University, Atlanta) 13 . The N191Q mutation in Hoxc6-V1 and N109Q mutation in Hoxc6-V2 (AAC -> CAG) in the homeodomain 16 was introduced using the Quik Change IIXL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The siRNA against Hoxc6 was made using pSR-neo vectors (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA). The oligonucleotides were inserted between the BglII and HindIII sites to produce short hairpin RNA. Two different sequences derived from human Hoxc6 mRNA (5?-GGGAAAAUUACAAAAAGAG-3?, 5?-GCGAAUGAAUUCGCACAGU-3?), common to both variants, were selected. For control siRNA, we used the sequence 5?-GCGCGCTTTGTAGGATTCG-3? that does not correspond to any known human gene. The stable transfected cells were selected in 200 ?g/ml geneticin (GIBCO) for 14 days, and clones were screened for Hoxc6 stable expression by Western Blotting using ANTI-FLAG M2 (Sigma) and for Hoxc6 silencing by q-PCR. The cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of F12 and DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2 at 37°C. Proliferation assay The stable cells were plated in 96-well plates (1,500–3,000 cells per well). Proliferation of cells was measured by a colorimetric assay using the CellTiter 96 aqueous one solution cell proliferation assay kit (Promega) on day 1, 3, and 7 after plating. Cell culture, transfections, and luciferase reporter assay DLD-1 and 293 cells were obtained from ATCC, and TPC-1 cells were a gift from James Fagin. One day after plating BON cells in a 12 well plate, 0.25 ?g of an AP-1 luciferase reporter construct that contains 4 consensus AP-1 binding sites and 5 ng of the pRL-CMV Renilla vector (Promega) were co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) 48 hours after transfection. In independent experiments, 0.25 ?g of a menin expression vector (gift of Matthew Meyerson) was transiently transfected into BON cells and RNA was harvested for qRT-PCR. siRNA of AP-1 components siRNA knockdown of the AP-1 components, cFos, JunD, and cJun, was performed with specific duplex oligos. The sequences were; 5?-GGAACAGUUAUCUCCAGAA-3? for cFos (NM_005252), 5?-GCAUGAUGAAGAAGGACGC-3? for JunD (NM_ 005354), and 5?-GGCACAGCUUAAACAGAAA-3? for cJun (NM_002228). A control siRNA that does not correspond to any known human gene, 5?-GGCGAUCAUAAACGACAAA-3?, was also utilized. The cells were transfected with 20 nM siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). AP-1 reporter constructs were co-transfected and dual luciferase assays were performed 48 hours after transfection. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation Cells were lysed in chilled lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (PSC, Roche). 15–20 ug protein lysate were resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Nuclear extracts were isolated using NE-PER kit (Pierce). The blots were probed with Flag and ?-Actin (Sigma) antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using Western Lighting Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (Perkin Elmer). Nuclear extracts were prepared using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (PIERCE). 300 ?g of nuclear proteins were incubated with ANTI-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) overnight at 4°C. The beads were washed 3 times with RIPA buffer (Boston BioProducts) for 5 min, and were boiled in NuPAGE SDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) for 10 min. The samples were run on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris Gels and detected by Western blotting using antibodies against JunD (sc-74, Santa Cruz) and Flag (Sigma). The expression levels of JunD and Hoxc6 in the samples were confirmed by Western Blotting. DNA affinity precipitation assay 200 – 400 ?g nuclear extracts of BON-Flag control, BON-Hoxc6-V1, BON-mHoxc6-V1, BON-Hoxc6-V2 and BON-mHoxc6-V2 cells were incubated with binding buffer (10mM Tris, 50mM KCl, 1mM DTT pH7.5, 50ng/?l Poly(dI·dC), 10% Glycerol and 1x HALT protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce)) for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were pre-cleared with Streptavidin-conjugated Agarose beads (Pierce) for 5 min. After centrifugation for 2 min at 2000 rpm, supernatants were incubated with 80 fmol of 5?-biotinylated AP1-probes for 30min. 25 ul of Streptavidin-conjugated Agarose beads were added and samples incubated for 2 hours at 4° C with gentle rotation. The samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm, beads were washed 3 times with binding buffer (without Poly(dI·dC)) and proteins eluted from the beads by the addition of 4x LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins were separated on 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were probed with a Flag antibody. DNA microarray studies and analysis RNA isolated from BON-Hoxc6-V1, BON-Hoxc6-V2 and BON-siHoxc6 cells was amplified and labeled with Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences). Control RNA amplified from BON-Flag cells was used as the reference sample and labeled with Cy3. Dye-swapping was also performed by replacing Cy3 with Cy5 labeling of the samples. Competitive hybridization of Cy5- and Cy3-labelled RNA samples was carried out on glass slides spotted with 34,594 oligonucleotide probes. The microarray slides were scanned using the MDS/Axon GenePix system (Molecular Devices) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The studies were performed at the Microarray core facility at the Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital. Data analysis is detailed in Supplementary Material .

Results Upregulation of Hoxc6 in gastrointestinal carcinoids Previous DNA microarray studies indicated that Hoxc6 and Hoxc8 were upregulated in gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors but not pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors 14 . Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to define expression levels of the two Hoxc6 variants in normal pancreas, normal ileum, intestinal carcinoids, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The expression level in normal pancreas was normalized to 1. For Hoxc6-V1, there was an 11.5 fold increase in expression in normal ileum, 35.6 fold increase in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and a 1244.8 fold increase in intestinal carcinoids. For Hoxc6-V2, the findings were similar. There was a 37.8 fold increase in expression in normal ileum, 27.4 fold increase in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and a 950.5 fold increase in ileal carcinoids ( Figure 1 ). In carcinoid tumors, there was also an upregulation of Hoxc8, although the level was somewhat lower. Compared to normal pancreas, there was a 26.1 fold increase in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and an 877.4 fold increase in ileal carcinoids. Thus, overexpression of both Hoxc6 variants and Hoxc8 appears to be a distinctive feature of gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors but not pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Interestingly, Hoxc6 and Hoxc8 have been reported as targets of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene in murine embryonic fibroblasts 6 . However, overexpression of menin in BON1 carcinoid cells did not induce Hoxc6 or Hoxc8 mRNA levels, as measured by qRT-PCR. Specifically, levels of Hoxc6 were induced 0.97-fold +/?0.14 and levels of Hoxc8 were induced 1.05 +/?0.21. Hoxc6 stimulates cellular proliferation of BON1 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> Because Hoxc6 was more significantly upregulated than Hoxc8 in carcinoids, we focused attention on this gene. To determine the functional consequences of Hoxc6 expression in carcinoid cells, BON1 stable cell lines were generated in which either Hoxc6-V1 or Hoxc6-V2 was overexpressed. Two independent clones of each construct were analyzed. In vitro growth assays revealed that overexpression of variant 1 was associated with a 74% (clone #3, p<0.01) to 92% (clone #17, p<0.01) increase in cell number compared to control transfected cells at 7 days ( Figure 2 ). Similarly, overexpression of variant 2 was associated with a 68% (clone #3, p<0.01) to 109% (clone #2, p<0.01) increase in cell number ( Figure 2 ). To verify this effect, BON1 cells were also generated that stably expressed an siRNA to endogenous Hoxc6. Hoxc6 expression levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR in multiple cell lines. In the DLD1 colon cancer cell line and the TPC thyroid cancer cell line, Hoxc6 levels were undetectable. Hoxc6 expression was detected in 293, Bon, and Panc1 cells. Compared to 293 cells, Hoxc6 expression levels were 2.3 fold higher in BON1 cells and 3.3 fold higher in Panc1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. The Hoxc6 siRNA sequence utilized was common to both variants and therefore targeted both Hoxc6 transcripts. The silencing efficiency of two independent siRNA constructs to Hoxc6 was excellent. In BON-siHoxc6#1 cells, levels of Hoxc6-V1 were suppressed to 16% of baseline and Hoxc6-V2 levels to 18% of baseline. Similarly, in BON-siHoxc6#3 cells, levels of Hoxc6-V1 were suppressed levels to 18% of baseline and levels of Hoxc6-V2 to 14% of baseline. When compared to BON1 cells expressing a control siRNA, there was a 43% decrease (p<0.01) in the number of BON-siHoxc6#1 cells and 49% decrease (p<0.01) in the number of BON-siHoxc6#3 cells at 7 days ( Figure 2 ). Thus, Hoxc6 can regulate the proliferation of carcinoid cells in vitro . Hoxc6 enhances signaling through the AP-1 pathway To determine the mechanism through which Hoxc6 may control cellular proliferation, we tested the consequences of Hoxc6 overexpression on the AP-1 signaling pathway that is frequently activated in human malignancies. An earlier report suggested that Hoxb4 can enhance signaling through the AP-1 pathway by upregulating the expression of Jun-B and Fra-1 in Rat-1 cells 17 . AP-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor that is a downstream target of multiple oncogenes, and it can regulate the expression of genes critical for cellular growth 18 . A consensus AP-1 luciferase reporter construct was introduced into BON1 cells that stably overexpressed Hoxc6. Compared to control BON1 cells, there was a 2.1 to 3.0 fold (p<0.01) increase in AP-1 reporter activity in BON-Hoxc6-V1 cells, and a 2.1 to 2.8 fold (p<0.01) increase in BON-Hoxc6-V2 cells ( Figure 3 ). This induction was observed in two independent clones. Similarly, in BON1 cells with Hoxc6 stably knocked-down, there was a 70% reduction (p<0.01) in AP-1 reporter activity in BON-siHoxc6#1 cells and a 66% reduction (p<0.01) in BON-siHoxc6#3 cells compared to control parental BON1 cells ( Figure 3 ). Thus, Hoxc6 can enhance signaling through the AP-1 pathway. c-Fos and JunD are the functional components of AP-1 in BON1 cells AP-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor comprised of Jun and Fos proteins, and the expression of these various components is cell-specific. In order to determine whether Hoxc6 mediates its effects through one or more particular component, each of these factors was selectively knocked down in BON1 cells stably overexpressing Hoxc6. The silencing efficiency of each AP-1 component is shown in Figure 4a . Knockdown of c-Fos or JunD blocked the induction of AP-1 activity mediated by both Hoxc6 variants ( Figure 4b,c ). However, knockdown of c-Jun had no effect upon AP-1 reporter activity ( Figure 4d ). These findings suggested that c-Fos and JunD were the critical components of AP-1 in carcinoid cells, and that Hoxc6 may enhance AP-1 activity through an interaction with c-Fos or JunD, but not c-Jun. Regulation of JunD expression by Hoxc6 In BON1 cells stably overexpressing Hoxc6, there was a modest increase in JunD mRNA levels. In BON-Hoxc6-V1 cells, there was a 2.23 fold increase (p<0.05) in JunD mRNA levels, but only a 1.56 fold increase (p=0.09) in BON-Hoxc6-V2 cells. In cells stably expressing Hoxc6 siRNA, there was a 35% decrease (p=0.07) in JunD mRNA levels compared to control cells. These findings suggest that Hoxc6 may regulate the expression of JunD, but that the level of induction is modest. Of note, menin mRNA levels were unchanged in BON1 cells stably expressing either variant of Hoxc6. Hoxc6 physically interacts with JunD through its homeodomain The effects of Hoxc6 on expression of JunD were relatively modest, and we were curious whether there may be additional mechanisms controlling AP-1 activity by Hoxc6. A physical interaction between the yeast homeodomain protein Hex and c-Jun has been previously described, and Helix III of the Hex homeodomain mediated this interaction 16 . Because c-Jun was not involved in the functional activation of AP-1 by Hoxc6, we determined whether Hoxc6 may instead interact with JunD. Immunoprecipitation of Hoxc6 from BON1 cells stably overexpressing Hoxc6 followed by immunoblotting with a JunD antibody revealed a specific interaction between endogenous JunD and both Hoxc6 variants ( Figure 5a ). Control studies were performed to determine whether Hoxc6 may bind to c-Jun, and immunoprecipitation of Hoxc6 followed by blotting with a c-Jun antibody failed to identify a specific interaction ( Figure 5b ). To test whether this interaction was mediated by Helix III of the homeodomain, a point mutation was introduced in the Hoxc6 construct. There is a conserved asparagine residue in Helix III of Hex that was previously demonstrated to be essential for its interaction with c-Jun 16 . This asparagine residue was selectively mutated in both Hoxc6 variants (N191Q in variant 1, designated mHoxc6-V1, and N109Q in variant 2, designated mHoxc6-V2). Immunoprecipitation-western studies revealed that both of these Hoxc6 mutants failed to interact with JunD ( Figure 5a ). To verify that Hoxc6 formed a complex with AP-1 that physically bound to DNA, a DNA-precipitation assay was performed. Nuclear extracts from BON1 cells overexpressing either Hoxc6-V1 or Hoxc6-V2 were incubated with a biotinylated AP-1 consensus element probe, and the AP-1 probe was precipitated with streptavidin beads. Precipitated proteins were separated on an acrylamide gel, and immunoblotting for Hoxc6 was performed. In control cells, no Hoxc6 was identified in the precipitated complex. However, an interaction between Hoxc6 and the AP-1 probe was identified in extracts from cells overexpressing either wild-type Hoxc6 variant 1 or variant 2. In contrast, when cells expressed mutant Hoxc6 (mHoxc6-V1 or mHoxc6-V2), no interaction with the AP-1 complex was observed ( Figure 6 ). Thus, Hoxc6 directly binds to the AP-1 complex on DNA, and this interaction is mediated by the homeodomain of Hoxc6. Mutant Hoxc6 inhibits AP-1 activity and cellular growth The functional effects of the interaction between Hoxc6 and AP-1 were verified by expressing the mutant Hoxc6 that fails to interact with JunD. In BON1 cells expressing either mHoxc6-V1 or mHoxc6-V2, there was a 57% (p<0.01) to 51% (p<0.01) reduction of AP-1 reporter activity, respectively, indicating that this Hoxc6 mutant can inhibit AP-1 activity. The growth rate of BON1 cells that stably expressed mHoxc6 was measured. In cells expressing either mHoxc6-V1 or mHoxc6-V2, there was a 55% to 50% (both p<0.01) reduction in cell number at 7 days, respectively ( Figure 7 ). Thus, mutant forms of Hoxc6 that cannot interact with JunD can inhibit AP-1 activity as well as cellular growth. Gene targets of Hoxc6 in BON1 cells To better define the role of Hoxc6 in carcinoid tumorigenesis, microarray studies were performed with RNA isolated from BON1 cells stably expressing Hoxc6-v1, Hoxc6-v2, siHoxc6, or a control plasmid. Differential gene expression patterns between these cells were identified utilizing a 1.5-fold change in expression levels and an FDR-adjusted p<0.05. There were 202 genes that were coordinately regulated by both Hoxc6-v1 and Hoxc6-v2, relative to siHoxc6, and heatmaps of these expression patterns are illustrated in the Supplementary Figure . There are 61 genes overexpressed in both BON-Hoxc6-V1 and BON-Hoxc6-V2 cells, relative to BON-siHoxc6, and the top 15 of these genes overexpressed in BON-Hoxc6-V1 cells that were also overexpressed in BON-Hoxc6-V2 cells were APOA2, ARHGDIB, S100A2, DHRS2, NTS, PYY, NPTX2, RBP1, EGR1, TM4SF3, CTGF, INHBB, BPIL1, C10orf10, and TMEM2. Interestingly, 3 of these genes are characteristically expressed in carcinoid cells. Both peptide YY (PYY) and neurotensin (NTS) are gut hormones that are often overexpressed in neuroendocrine tumors, including carcinoids 19 , 20 . Furthermore, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has recently been described as an autocrine growth factor for gastric enterochromaffin-like cells 21 . qRT-PCR utilizing RNA from 3 BON1 clones overexpressing Hoxc6-V1 and 2 BON1 clones overexpressing Hoxc6-V2 confirmed a 1.8 fold induction of NT levels and 2.7 fold induction of CTGF levels. In both cases, expression of mHoxc6-V1 or mHoxc6-V2 resulted in a 30% reduction of NT and CTGF levels. No induction of PYY was seen by QPCR. Of note, both the NT and CTGF genes have key AP-1 regulatory sites in their promoters 22 , 23 .  Results Upregulation of Hoxc6 in gastrointestinal carcinoids Previous DNA microarray studies indicated that Hoxc6 and Hoxc8 were upregulated in gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors but not pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors 14 . Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to define expression levels of the two Hoxc6 variants in normal pancreas, normal ileum, intestinal carcinoids, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The expression level in normal pancreas was normalized to 1. For Hoxc6-V1, there was an 11.5 fold increase in expression in normal ileum, 35.6 fold increase in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and a 1244.8 fold increase in intestinal carcinoids. For Hoxc6-V2, the findings were similar. There was a 37.8 fold increase in expression in normal ileum, 27.4 fold increase in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and a 950.5 fold increase in ileal carcinoids ( Figure 1 ). In carcinoid tumors, there was also an upregulation of Hoxc8, although the level was somewhat lower. Compared to normal pancreas, there was a 26.1 fold increase in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and an 877.4 fold increase in ileal carcinoids. Thus, overexpression of both Hoxc6 variants and Hoxc8 appears to be a distinctive feature of gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors but not pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Interestingly, Hoxc6 and Hoxc8 have been reported as targets of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene in murine embryonic fibroblasts 6 . However, overexpression of menin in BON1 carcinoid cells did not induce Hoxc6 or Hoxc8 mRNA levels, as measured by qRT-PCR. Specifically, levels of Hoxc6 were induced 0.97-fold +/?0.14 and levels of Hoxc8 were induced 1.05 +/?0.21. Hoxc6 stimulates cellular proliferation of BON1 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> Because Hoxc6 was more significantly upregulated than Hoxc8 in carcinoids, we focused attention on this gene. To determine the functional consequences of Hoxc6 expression in carcinoid cells, BON1 stable cell lines were generated in which either Hoxc6-V1 or Hoxc6-V2 was overexpressed. Two independent clones of each construct were analyzed. In vitro growth assays revealed that overexpression of variant 1 was associated with a 74% (clone #3, p<0.01) to 92% (clone #17, p<0.01) increase in cell number compared to control transfected cells at 7 days ( Figure 2 ). Similarly, overexpression of variant 2 was associated with a 68% (clone #3, p<0.01) to 109% (clone #2, p<0.01) increase in cell number ( Figure 2 ). To verify this effect, BON1 cells were also generated that stably expressed an siRNA to endogenous Hoxc6. Hoxc6 expression levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR in multiple cell lines. In the DLD1 colon cancer cell line and the TPC thyroid cancer cell line, Hoxc6 levels were undetectable. Hoxc6 expression was detected in 293, Bon, and Panc1 cells. Compared to 293 cells, Hoxc6 expression levels were 2.3 fold higher in BON1 cells and 3.3 fold higher in Panc1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. The Hoxc6 siRNA sequence utilized was common to both variants and therefore targeted both Hoxc6 transcripts. The silencing efficiency of two independent siRNA constructs to Hoxc6 was excellent. In BON-siHoxc6#1 cells, levels of Hoxc6-V1 were suppressed to 16% of baseline and Hoxc6-V2 levels to 18% of baseline. Similarly, in BON-siHoxc6#3 cells, levels of Hoxc6-V1 were suppressed levels to 18% of baseline and levels of Hoxc6-V2 to 14% of baseline. When compared to BON1 cells expressing a control siRNA, there was a 43% decrease (p<0.01) in the number of BON-siHoxc6#1 cells and 49% decrease (p<0.01) in the number of BON-siHoxc6#3 cells at 7 days ( Figure 2 ). Thus, Hoxc6 can regulate the proliferation of carcinoid cells in vitro . Hoxc6 enhances signaling through the AP-1 pathway To determine the mechanism through which Hoxc6 may control cellular proliferation, we tested the consequences of Hoxc6 overexpression on the AP-1 signaling pathway that is frequently activated in human malignancies. An earlier report suggested that Hoxb4 can enhance signaling through the AP-1 pathway by upregulating the expression of Jun-B and Fra-1 in Rat-1 cells 17 . AP-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor that is a downstream target of multiple oncogenes, and it can regulate the expression of genes critical for cellular growth 18 . A consensus AP-1 luciferase reporter construct was introduced into BON1 cells that stably overexpressed Hoxc6. Compared to control BON1 cells, there was a 2.1 to 3.0 fold (p<0.01) increase in AP-1 reporter activity in BON-Hoxc6-V1 cells, and a 2.1 to 2.8 fold (p<0.01) increase in BON-Hoxc6-V2 cells ( Figure 3 ). This induction was observed in two independent clones. Similarly, in BON1 cells with Hoxc6 stably knocked-down, there was a 70% reduction (p<0.01) in AP-1 reporter activity in BON-siHoxc6#1 cells and a 66% reduction (p<0.01) in BON-siHoxc6#3 cells compared to control parental BON1 cells ( Figure 3 ). Thus, Hoxc6 can enhance signaling through the AP-1 pathway. c-Fos and JunD are the functional components of AP-1 in BON1 cells AP-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor comprised of Jun and Fos proteins, and the expression of these various components is cell-specific. In order to determine whether Hoxc6 mediates its effects through one or more particular component, each of these factors was selectively knocked down in BON1 cells stably overexpressing Hoxc6. The silencing efficiency of each AP-1 component is shown in Figure 4a . Knockdown of c-Fos or JunD blocked the induction of AP-1 activity mediated by both Hoxc6 variants ( Figure 4b,c ). However, knockdown of c-Jun had no effect upon AP-1 reporter activity ( Figure 4d ). These findings suggested that c-Fos and JunD were the critical components of AP-1 in carcinoid cells, and that Hoxc6 may enhance AP-1 activity through an interaction with c-Fos or JunD, but not c-Jun. Regulation of JunD expression by Hoxc6 In BON1 cells stably overexpressing Hoxc6, there was a modest increase in JunD mRNA levels. In BON-Hoxc6-V1 cells, there was a 2.23 fold increase (p<0.05) in JunD mRNA levels, but only a 1.56 fold increase (p=0.09) in BON-Hoxc6-V2 cells. In cells stably expressing Hoxc6 siRNA, there was a 35% decrease (p=0.07) in JunD mRNA levels compared to control cells. These findings suggest that Hoxc6 may regulate the expression of JunD, but that the level of induction is modest. Of note, menin mRNA levels were unchanged in BON1 cells stably expressing either variant of Hoxc6. Hoxc6 physically interacts with JunD through its homeodomain The effects of Hoxc6 on expression of JunD were relatively modest, and we were curious whether there may be additional mechanisms controlling AP-1 activity by Hoxc6. A physical interaction between the yeast homeodomain protein Hex and c-Jun has been previously described, and Helix III of the Hex homeodomain mediated this interaction 16 . Because c-Jun was not involved in the functional activation of AP-1 by Hoxc6, we determined whether Hoxc6 may instead interact with JunD. Immunoprecipitation of Hoxc6 from BON1 cells stably overexpressing Hoxc6 followed by immunoblotting with a JunD antibody revealed a specific interaction between endogenous JunD and both Hoxc6 variants ( Figure 5a ). Control studies were performed to determine whether Hoxc6 may bind to c-Jun, and immunoprecipitation of Hoxc6 followed by blotting with a c-Jun antibody failed to identify a specific interaction ( Figure 5b ). To test whether this interaction was mediated by Helix III of the homeodomain, a point mutation was introduced in the Hoxc6 construct. There is a conserved asparagine residue in Helix III of Hex that was previously demonstrated to be essential for its interaction with c-Jun 16 . This asparagine residue was selectively mutated in both Hoxc6 variants (N191Q in variant 1, designated mHoxc6-V1, and N109Q in variant 2, designated mHoxc6-V2). Immunoprecipitation-western studies revealed that both of these Hoxc6 mutants failed to interact with JunD ( Figure 5a ). To verify that Hoxc6 formed a complex with AP-1 that physically bound to DNA, a DNA-precipitation assay was performed. Nuclear extracts from BON1 cells overexpressing either Hoxc6-V1 or Hoxc6-V2 were incubated with a biotinylated AP-1 consensus element probe, and the AP-1 probe was precipitated with streptavidin beads. Precipitated proteins were separated on an acrylamide gel, and immunoblotting for Hoxc6 was performed. In control cells, no Hoxc6 was identified in the precipitated complex. However, an interaction between Hoxc6 and the AP-1 probe was identified in extracts from cells overexpressing either wild-type Hoxc6 variant 1 or variant 2. In contrast, when cells expressed mutant Hoxc6 (mHoxc6-V1 or mHoxc6-V2), no interaction with the AP-1 complex was observed ( Figure 6 ). Thus, Hoxc6 directly binds to the AP-1 complex on DNA, and this interaction is mediated by the homeodomain of Hoxc6. Mutant Hoxc6 inhibits AP-1 activity and cellular growth The functional effects of the interaction between Hoxc6 and AP-1 were verified by expressing the mutant Hoxc6 that fails to interact with JunD. In BON1 cells expressing either mHoxc6-V1 or mHoxc6-V2, there was a 57% (p<0.01) to 51% (p<0.01) reduction of AP-1 reporter activity, respectively, indicating that this Hoxc6 mutant can inhibit AP-1 activity. The growth rate of BON1 cells that stably expressed mHoxc6 was measured. In cells expressing either mHoxc6-V1 or mHoxc6-V2, there was a 55% to 50% (both p<0.01) reduction in cell number at 7 days, respectively ( Figure 7 ). Thus, mutant forms of Hoxc6 that cannot interact with JunD can inhibit AP-1 activity as well as cellular growth. Gene targets of Hoxc6 in BON1 cells To better define the role of Hoxc6 in carcinoid tumorigenesis, microarray studies were performed with RNA isolated from BON1 cells stably expressing Hoxc6-v1, Hoxc6-v2, siHoxc6, or a control plasmid. Differential gene expression patterns between these cells were identified utilizing a 1.5-fold change in expression levels and an FDR-adjusted p<0.05. There were 202 genes that were coordinately regulated by both Hoxc6-v1 and Hoxc6-v2, relative to siHoxc6, and heatmaps of these expression patterns are illustrated in the Supplementary Figure . There are 61 genes overexpressed in both BON-Hoxc6-V1 and BON-Hoxc6-V2 cells, relative to BON-siHoxc6, and the top 15 of these genes overexpressed in BON-Hoxc6-V1 cells that were also overexpressed in BON-Hoxc6-V2 cells were APOA2, ARHGDIB, S100A2, DHRS2, NTS, PYY, NPTX2, RBP1, EGR1, TM4SF3, CTGF, INHBB, BPIL1, C10orf10, and TMEM2. Interestingly, 3 of these genes are characteristically expressed in carcinoid cells. Both peptide YY (PYY) and neurotensin (NTS) are gut hormones that are often overexpressed in neuroendocrine tumors, including carcinoids 19 , 20 . Furthermore, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has recently been described as an autocrine growth factor for gastric enterochromaffin-like cells 21 . qRT-PCR utilizing RNA from 3 BON1 clones overexpressing Hoxc6-V1 and 2 BON1 clones overexpressing Hoxc6-V2 confirmed a 1.8 fold induction of NT levels and 2.7 fold induction of CTGF levels. In both cases, expression of mHoxc6-V1 or mHoxc6-V2 resulted in a 30% reduction of NT and CTGF levels. No induction of PYY was seen by QPCR. Of note, both the NT and CTGF genes have key AP-1 regulatory sites in their promoters 22 , 23 .  Upregulation of Hoxc6 in gastrointestinal carcinoids Previous DNA microarray studies indicated that Hoxc6 and Hoxc8 were upregulated in gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors but not pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors 14 . Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to define expression levels of the two Hoxc6 variants in normal pancreas, normal ileum, intestinal carcinoids, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The expression level in normal pancreas was normalized to 1. For Hoxc6-V1, there was an 11.5 fold increase in expression in normal ileum, 35.6 fold increase in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and a 1244.8 fold increase in intestinal carcinoids. For Hoxc6-V2, the findings were similar. There was a 37.8 fold increase in expression in normal ileum, 27.4 fold increase in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and a 950.5 fold increase in ileal carcinoids ( Figure 1 ). In carcinoid tumors, there was also an upregulation of Hoxc8, although the level was somewhat lower. Compared to normal pancreas, there was a 26.1 fold increase in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and an 877.4 fold increase in ileal carcinoids. Thus, overexpression of both Hoxc6 variants and Hoxc8 appears to be a distinctive feature of gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors but not pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Interestingly, Hoxc6 and Hoxc8 have been reported as targets of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene in murine embryonic fibroblasts 6 . However, overexpression of menin in BON1 carcinoid cells did not induce Hoxc6 or Hoxc8 mRNA levels, as measured by qRT-PCR. Specifically, levels of Hoxc6 were induced 0.97-fold +/?0.14 and levels of Hoxc8 were induced 1.05 +/?0.21.

Hoxc6 enhances signaling through the AP-1 pathway To determine the mechanism through which Hoxc6 may control cellular proliferation, we tested the consequences of Hoxc6 overexpression on the AP-1 signaling pathway that is frequently activated in human malignancies.

Compared to control BON1 cells, there was a 2.1 to 3.0 fold (p<0.01) increase in AP-1 reporter activity in BON-Hoxc6-V1 cells, and a 2.1 to 2.8 fold (p<0.01) increase in BON-Hoxc6-V2 cells ( Figure 3 ). This induction was observed in two independent clones. Similarly, in BON1 cells with Hoxc6 stably knocked-down, there was a 70% reduction (p<0.01) in AP-1 reporter activity in BON-siHoxc6#1 cells and a 66% reduction (p<0.01) in BON-siHoxc6#3 cells compared to control parental BON1 cells ( Figure 3 ). Thus, Hoxc6 can enhance signaling through the AP-1 pathway.

Thus, Hoxc6 can enhance signaling through the AP-1 pathway.  c-Fos and JunD are the functional components of AP-1 in BON1 cells AP-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor comprised of Jun and Fos proteins, and the expression of these various components is cell-specific. In order to determine whether Hoxc6 mediates its effects through one or more particular component, each of these factors was selectively knocked down in BON1 cells stably overexpressing Hoxc6. The silencing efficiency of each AP-1 component is shown in Figure 4a . Knockdown of c-Fos or JunD blocked the induction of AP-1 activity mediated by both Hoxc6 variants ( Figure 4b,c ). However, knockdown of c-Jun had no effect upon AP-1 reporter activity ( Figure 4d ). These findings suggested that c-Fos and JunD were the critical components of AP-1 in carcinoid cells, and that Hoxc6 may enhance AP-1 activity through an interaction with c-Fos or JunD, but not c-Jun.  c-Fos and JunD are the functional components of AP-1 in BON1 cells AP-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor comprised of Jun and Fos proteins, and the expression of these various components is cell-specific.

Regulation of JunD expression by Hoxc6 In BON1 cells stably overexpressing Hoxc6, there was a modest increase in JunD mRNA levels. In BON-Hoxc6-V1 cells, there was a 2.23 fold increase (p<0.05) in JunD mRNA levels, but only a 1.56 fold increase (p=0.09) in BON-Hoxc6-V2 cells. In cells stably expressing Hoxc6 siRNA, there was a 35% decrease (p=0.07) in JunD mRNA levels compared to control cells. These findings suggest that Hoxc6 may regulate the expression of JunD, but that the level of induction is modest. Of note, menin mRNA levels were unchanged in BON1 cells stably expressing either variant of Hoxc6.  Regulation of JunD expression by Hoxc6 In BON1 cells stably overexpressing Hoxc6, there was a modest increase in JunD mRNA levels. In BON-Hoxc6-V1 cells, there was a 2.23 fold increase (p<0.05) in JunD mRNA levels, but only a 1.56 fold increase (p=0.09) in BON-Hoxc6-V2 cells. In cells stably expressing Hoxc6 siRNA, there was a 35% decrease (p=0.07) in JunD mRNA levels compared to control cells. These findings suggest that Hoxc6 may regulate the expression of JunD, but that the level of induction is modest. Of note, menin mRNA levels were unchanged in BON1 cells stably expressing either variant of Hoxc6.  Hoxc6 physically interacts with JunD through its homeodomain The effects of Hoxc6 on expression of JunD were relatively modest, and we were curious whether there may be additional mechanisms controlling AP-1 activity by Hoxc6. A physical interaction between the yeast homeodomain protein Hex and c-Jun has been previously described, and Helix III of the Hex homeodomain mediated this interaction 16 . Because c-Jun was not involved in the functional activation of AP-1 by Hoxc6, we determined whether Hoxc6 may instead interact with JunD. Immunoprecipitation of Hoxc6 from BON1 cells stably overexpressing Hoxc6 followed by immunoblotting with a JunD antibody revealed a specific interaction between endogenous JunD and both Hoxc6 variants ( Figure 5a ). Control studies were performed to determine whether Hoxc6 may bind to c-Jun, and immunoprecipitation of Hoxc6 followed by blotting with a c-Jun antibody failed to identify a specific interaction ( Figure 5b ). To test whether this interaction was mediated by Helix III of the homeodomain, a point mutation was introduced in the Hoxc6 construct. There is a conserved asparagine residue in Helix III of Hex that was previously demonstrated to be essential for its interaction with c-Jun 16 . This asparagine residue was selectively mutated in both Hoxc6 variants (N191Q in variant 1, designated mHoxc6-V1, and N109Q in variant 2, designated mHoxc6-V2). Immunoprecipitation-western studies revealed that both of these Hoxc6 mutants failed to interact with JunD ( Figure 5a ). To verify that Hoxc6 formed a complex with AP-1 that physically bound to DNA, a DNA-precipitation assay was performed. Nuclear extracts from BON1 cells overexpressing either Hoxc6-V1 or Hoxc6-V2 were incubated with a biotinylated AP-1 consensus element probe, and the AP-1 probe was precipitated with streptavidin beads. Precipitated proteins were separated on an acrylamide gel, and immunoblotting for Hoxc6 was performed. In control cells, no Hoxc6 was identified in the precipitated complex. However, an interaction between Hoxc6 and the AP-1 probe was identified in extracts from cells overexpressing either wild-type Hoxc6 variant 1 or variant 2. In contrast, when cells expressed mutant Hoxc6 (mHoxc6-V1 or mHoxc6-V2), no interaction with the AP-1 complex was observed ( Figure 6 ). Thus, Hoxc6 directly binds to the AP-1 complex on DNA, and this interaction is mediated by the homeodomain of Hoxc6.  Hoxc6 physically interacts with JunD through its homeodomain The effects of Hoxc6 on expression of JunD were relatively modest, and we were curious whether there may be additional mechanisms controlling AP-1 activity by Hoxc6.

In contrast, when cells expressed mutant Hoxc6 (mHoxc6-V1 or mHoxc6-V2), no interaction with the AP-1 complex was observed ( Figure 6 ). Thus, Hoxc6 directly binds to the AP-1 complex on DNA, and this interaction is mediated by the homeodomain of Hoxc6.  Mutant Hoxc6 inhibits AP-1 activity and cellular growth The functional effects of the interaction between Hoxc6 and AP-1 were verified by expressing the mutant Hoxc6 that fails to interact with JunD. In BON1 cells expressing either mHoxc6-V1 or mHoxc6-V2, there was a 57% (p<0.01) to 51% (p<0.01) reduction of AP-1 reporter activity, respectively, indicating that this Hoxc6 mutant can inhibit AP-1 activity. The growth rate of BON1 cells that stably expressed mHoxc6 was measured. In cells expressing either mHoxc6-V1 or mHoxc6-V2, there was a 55% to 50% (both p<0.01) reduction in cell number at 7 days, respectively ( Figure 7 ). Thus, mutant forms of Hoxc6 that cannot interact with JunD can inhibit AP-1 activity as well as cellular growth.

Thus, mutant forms of Hoxc6 that cannot interact with JunD can inhibit AP-1 activity as well as cellular growth.  Gene targets of Hoxc6 in BON1 cells To better define the role of Hoxc6 in carcinoid tumorigenesis, microarray studies were performed with RNA isolated from BON1 cells stably expressing Hoxc6-v1, Hoxc6-v2, siHoxc6, or a control plasmid. Differential gene expression patterns between these cells were identified utilizing a 1.5-fold change in expression levels and an FDR-adjusted p<0.05. There were 202 genes that were coordinately regulated by both Hoxc6-v1 and Hoxc6-v2, relative to siHoxc6, and heatmaps of these expression patterns are illustrated in the Supplementary Figure . There are 61 genes overexpressed in both BON-Hoxc6-V1 and BON-Hoxc6-V2 cells, relative to BON-siHoxc6, and the top 15 of these genes overexpressed in BON-Hoxc6-V1 cells that were also overexpressed in BON-Hoxc6-V2 cells were APOA2, ARHGDIB, S100A2, DHRS2, NTS, PYY, NPTX2, RBP1, EGR1, TM4SF3, CTGF, INHBB, BPIL1, C10orf10, and TMEM2. Interestingly, 3 of these genes are characteristically expressed in carcinoid cells. Both peptide YY (PYY) and neurotensin (NTS) are gut hormones that are often overexpressed in neuroendocrine tumors, including carcinoids 19 , 20 . Furthermore, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has recently been described as an autocrine growth factor for gastric enterochromaffin-like cells 21 . qRT-PCR utilizing RNA from 3 BON1 clones overexpressing Hoxc6-V1 and 2 BON1 clones overexpressing Hoxc6-V2 confirmed a 1.8 fold induction of NT levels and 2.7 fold induction of CTGF levels. In both cases, expression of mHoxc6-V1 or mHoxc6-V2 resulted in a 30% reduction of NT and CTGF levels. No induction of PYY was seen by QPCR. Of note, both the NT and CTGF genes have key AP-1 regulatory sites in their promoters 22 , 23 .

Unfortunately, the therapeutic options for advanced disease are limited 19 . The poor understanding of the molecular genetic alterations that underlie these tumors has hindered the search for new therapies. Defining the key facets of the molecular circuitry of these tumors is an important prerequisite to the rational design of novel targeted approaches. The current studies have identified a new molecular pathway in carcinoid tumorigenesis that involves the Hoxc6 homeobox gene. HOX genes are critical regulators of cellular proliferation and differentiation during development. Deregulated expression of HOX genes has been observed in many tumor types including leukemia, breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Among these tumors, a pathogenic role for a HOX gene has been demonstrated in leukemias 24 . However, the mechanisms by which HOX genes contribute to tumorigenesis are poorly defined. Although HOX genes are homeodomain transcription factors that recognize a consensus TAAT motif, their functions in cancer are far more diverse 10 . Overexpression of homeobox genes can induce cellular transformation 25 , 26 , and this may be mediated by the upregulation of genes normally targeted during development, such as fibroblast growth factor 11 . However, other non-transcriptional functions have been defined as well. For example, Hox11 can control the G2 cell-cycle checkpoint through its physical interaction with protein phosphatases PP2A and PP4 27 . Our studies have identified a new role for Hoxc6 in carcinoid tumorigenesis. In the developing mouse embryo, Hoxc6 is expressed in the spinal cord, prevertebrae, kidney, and selected compartments of lung, stomach, and intestine 28 . In human tumors, overexpression of Hoxc6 has thus far been implicated in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer 12 , 13 . In the prostate, Hoxc6 appears to regulate the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-7, fibroblast growth factor receptor-2, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, and platelet derived growth factor receptor-A, all of which have been implicated in tumorigenesis 29 . These genes were not identified in our microarray analysis, suggesting that the functions of Hoxc6 are tissue-specific. This is consistent with prior studies that have demonstrated distinctive functions of Hox genes depending upon the tissue in which they were expressed 30 . In carcinoid tumors, Hoxc6 appears to function in a novel manner as a potent enhancer of signaling through the AP-1 pathway, and this is mediated through JunD. There are at least 2 distinct mechanisms for this effect. First, Hoxc6 can modestly upregulate JunD. In addition, Hoxc6 can physically interact with JunD to enhance transcriptional activation through AP-1, and this interaction is mediated by the homeodomain of Hoxc6. This contrasts with the related yeast transcription factor Hex. Hex also binds to AP-1 proteins through its homeodomain, but Hex functions to inhibit AP-1 activity. This inhibitory activity is strengthened when a Hex binding site in addition to an AP-1 binding site is present in the promoter 16 . Thus, homeobox proteins may be important regulators of AP-1 activity, and Hoxc6 functions as an enhancer of AP-1 activity in carcinoid tumors. The AP-1 transcription factor regulates a diverse set of cellular processes, and these effects are not only cell-specific but also dependent upon the balance of specific Fos and Jun proteins. In contrast to c-Jun, the precise functions of JunD remain incompletely described 18 . Depending upon the particular environment, JunD can exhibit either pro-proliferative or growth inhibitory properties 31 . The tumor suppressor protein menin has been reported to interact with JunD, and it can suppress the growth promoting activity of JunD 32 , 33 . Our studies revealed that Hoxc6 enhances the effects of JunD to stimulate proliferation in carcinoid cells. This was specific to JunD, as no effect was observed when the related factor c-Jun was silenced. Furthermore, there was no physical interaction between Hoxc6 and c-Jun. The relationship between Hoxc6 and menin in human carcinoid tumors remains uncertain. Studies in murine embryonic tissue have previously demonstrated an induction of Hoxc6 by menin 6 . However, menin mRNA levels in human carcinoid tumors and BON1 cells were low, and overexpression of menin in BON1 cells did not induce Hoxc6 gene expression. These observations may be attributable to the differences in species or in the developmental stages of the tissues studied. Whether menin may independently regulate the physical interaction between Hoxc6 and JunD remains to be determined. This dramatic and selective induction of Hoxc6 in carcinoid tumors but not pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, normal pancreas, or normal intestine suggests that there are likely to be tissue-specific mechanisms that regulate the expression of Hoxc6. During development, regulation of Hox gene expression is tightly controlled and highly dependent upon the precise activity of chromatin-remodeling proteins 34 . The pathways that control aberrant expression of Hox genes in adult tumors are unknown. Our study has focused on carcinoids arising in the intestine, and it would be important to determine whether Hoxc6 overexpression is observed in carcinoids from lung and stomach. In addition, it would be of interest to define when during tumor progression this upregulation first occurs. Our tumors were primarily advanced metastatic lesions, and this reflects the rarity with which small benign carcinoids are recognized pre-operatively. In addition to its role in tumor pathogenesis, Hoxc6 may also play a role in specifying the neuroendocrine phenotype, as Hoxc6 upregulates multiple neuroendocrine markers including neurotensin. Hoxc6 also upregulates CTGF, which is an important growth factor in gastric carcinoids 21 . This selective upregulation suggests that Hoxc6 may be an important therapeutic target. Potential strategies include inhibition of Hoxc6 directly, inhibition of the interaction between Hoxc6 and JunD, or inhibition of the AP-1 signaling pathway in general. Regardless, these observations have revealed a new pathway that underlies the molecular pathogenesis of carcinoid tumors.  Discussion Intestinal carcinoid tumors remain a fascinating clinical entity.
