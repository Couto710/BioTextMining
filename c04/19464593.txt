Applications of Genomics in Melanoma Oncogene Discovery <bold>SYNOPSIS</bold> (for table of contents) The identification of recurrent alterations in the melanoma genome has provided key insights into the biology of melanoma genesis and progression. These discoveries have come about as a result of the systematic deployment and integration of diverse genomic technologies, including DNA sequencing, chromosomal copy number analysis, and gene expression profiling. Here, we chronicle the discoveries of several key melanoma oncogenes affecting critical cell pathways and examine the role played by evolving genomics technologies in melanoma oncogene discovery. These advances are being exploited to improve prognosis and treatment of melanoma patients through the development of genome-based diagnostic and targeted therapeutic avenues.
