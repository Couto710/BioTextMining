Engagement in persons with dementia: the concept and its measurement Purpose: The aim of this paper is to delineate the underlying premises of the concept of engagement in persons with dementia and present a new theoretical framework of engagement. Setting/Subjects: The sample included 193 residents of 7 Maryland nursing homes. All participants had a diagnosis of dementia. Methodology: We describe a model of factors that affect engagement of persons with dementia. Moreover, we present the psychometric qualities of an assessment designed to capture the dimensions of engagement (OME, Observational Measurement of Engagement). Finally, we detail plans for future research as well as data analyses that are currently underway. Discussion: This paper lays the foundation for a new theoretical framework concerning the mechanisms of interactions between persons with cognitive impairment and environmental stimuli. Additionally, the study examines what factors are associated with interest and negative and positive feelings in engagement.  Procedures Participants This study was reviewed and approved by the IRB at the Charles E. Smith Life Communities. The sample included 193 residents of 7 Maryland nursing homes. Informed consent was obtained for all study participants from their relatives or other responsible parties. Additional information on the informed consent process is available elsewhere (Cohen-Mansfield et al., 1988). Our main criterion for inclusion was a diagnosis of dementia (derived from either the medical chart or the attending physician). The criteria for exclusion were: ? The resident had an accompanying diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. ? The resident had no dexterity movement in either hand. ? The resident could not be seated in a chair or wheelchair. ? The resident was blind or deaf. ? The resident was younger than 60 years of age. Once consent was obtained for eligible participants, background information was gathered from each participant's chart in the nursing home. In addition, the MMSE was administered to each participant. Those who received MMSE scores greater than 23 were dropped from the study, as persons with a comparatively higher level of cognitive functioning are usually able to articulate their interests and needs. In our study, 151 participants were female (78%), and age averaged 86 years (SD 7.5, ranging from 60 to 101 years). The majority of participants were Caucasian (81%), and most were widowed (65%). ADL performance, which was obtained through the Minimum Data Set [30], averaged 3.6 (SD 1.0, range 1-5; Scale: 1- ‘independent’ to 5- ‘complete dependence’). Cognitive functioning, as assessed via the Mini-Mental State Examination ( 14 ), averaged 7.2 (SD 6.3, range 0-23). Participants had an average of 6.7 medical diagnoses (SD 2.6, ranging from 2 to 18). Very few (1.1%) participants had no schooling, 16.6% had completed 11th grade or less, 45% had completed high school, 12.2% had completed either some college or a technical or trade school and 25% had earned a Bachelor's degree or higher. Participants worked in a wide variety of occupations, with the most common being homemaker (20.2%), business (17.1%), clerk/secretaries (16.1%), health field work (9.3%), education (7.3%), and government (5.2%). Fewer than 5% worked in the following occupations: industry; human services; law; armed forces (Military/Army/Navy); art; retired; general services (e.g. house cleaner); agriculture; science; and other fields. We included 24 stimuli, chosen on the basis of their ability to elucidate factors that may affect engagement, and on the basis of discussions with research and clinical personnel who have been engaging nursing home residents over the past several years. The stimuli were chosen to demonstrate different levels on dimensions that could affect engagement, including being life like or artificial, social vs. nonsocial, manipulative vs. passive, work- related vs. not work, and having a personal meaning vs. being general. We are currently analyzing the effects of these dimensions. The stimuli were: a life-like doll, a plush animal, a childish doll, an expanding sphere, music, a tetherball, a squeeze ball, a large print magazine, a fabric book, a respite video, a wallet/purse, an activity pillow, stamping envelopes, coloring with markers, towels to fold, flower arrangement, building blocks, a robotic animal, a sorting task, a puzzle, a real baby, a real pet, and 2 stimuli personalized for each resident on the basis of past and present interests. The personalized stimuli were designed after identifying the most important identity or preference in the participant's life, both past and present through the Self-Identity Questionnaire ( 32 ). This questionnaire included information such as the particular job that was important to the participant, the particular family member who was the most important to the participant, and what specific activities/hobbies the participant enjoyed, etc. An example of a personalized stimuli based on the family/social role is when participants listened to audiotapes prepared by the participant's family or made a family tree for the grandchildren An example of a personalized stimulus based on the participants professional role is when a former air force engineer was asked to construct a model plane ( 33 ). All personalized stimuli were designed so that: ? It was directly related to the detailed content and/or context of the role identity ? It was appropriate for the cognitive, physical and sensory abilities of the participant ? It considered the demographics of the participant (e.g. gender, educational level, primary language)  Participants This study was reviewed and approved by the IRB at the Charles E.

Duration refers to the amount of time that the participant was occupied or involved with a stimulus, as observed by visually focusing on the stimulus, being physically occupied with the stimulus, turning body toward the stimulus or changing body position or handling of the stimulus. This measure starts after presentation of the engagement stimulus and ends at 15 minutes, or at the point when the participant stops being engaged with the stimulus. Duration is measured in seconds. Attention to the stimulus occurs when the study participant is focused on the stimulus, i.e., eye tracking, visual scanning, facial, motoric or verbal feedback, or eye contact. Attention is measured on a 4-point scale: not attentive, somewhat attentive, attentive, and very attentive. Level of attention observed during most of the trial and the highest attention level during the trial are recorded. Attitude toward the stimulus may be observed by positive or negative facial expression, verbal content or physical movement toward the stimulus. Positive attitude includes, when the study participant smiles, laughs, or shows other outward manifestation of happiness. Negative attitude includes participant aggressively pushes stimulus away (ex: starts to use toy blocks and then pushes them away angrily), throwing the stimulus, cursing, manifesting frustration at the stimulus (ex: watching a respite video and becoming angry at the video because they don't like to sing) and other outward manifestations of negativity. Attitude during an engagement trial is measured on a 7–point scale: very negative, negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, positive, and very positive. Attitude to the stimulus seen during most of the trial is recorded, as well as the highest rating of attitude observed during the trial. Activity For this variable, we observed the participant's actions toward the stimulus during an engagement trial. Using a 4-point scale – none of the time, a little of the time (less than 16 seconds), some of the time, and most or all of the time – we recorded the amount of time that each of the following was observed during an engagement trial: ? the participant held the stimulus ? the participant manipulated the stimulus ? the participant talked to the stimulus ? the participant talked about the stimulus ? the participant was disruptive ? the participant inappropriately manipulated the engagement stimulus (e.g., eating or biting blocks) ? other The target of the participant's remarks while engaged was also noted. We recorded all targets to whom the participant spoke while engaged, including the stimulus itself, the participant him/herself, a staff member(s), another resident(s), research personnel, and other. Finally, we noted the content of the study participant's remarks while engaged, recording when the subject of the resident's words was the stimulus itself, the participant him/herself, a staff member(s), another resident(s), research personnel, and/or other. Sometimes it was not possible to determine the target or the content, which was recorded on the OME. Data for the OME were recorded through direct observations using specially designed software installed on a handheld computer, the Palm One Zire 31™.

Data for the OME were recorded through direct observations using specially designed software installed on a handheld computer, the Palm One Zire 31™.  Results Psychometric qualities of the OME For these variables -- talking to object, talking about object, disruptive, and inappropriate -- results showed that over 80% of the responses were “none of the time”. For the purpose of analysis, these variables were dichotomized into ‘no’ = 0 and ‘yes’ = 1. Inter-rater reliability Inter-rater reliability of the OME was assessed by having 6 dyads of research assistants record responses on the engagement measures during 48 engagement sessions with nursing home residents. The inter-rater agreement rate (for 1-point discrepancy) was 84% for the engagement outcome measures and 92% for the action variables. Intraclass correlation averaged 0.78 for the engagement outcome variables and 0.65 for the action variables. Correlations across items and across dimensions In order to understand the relationships between the measurements of engagement, we examined the correlations across the measures. We calculated correlations among the engagement measures for each of the 24 stimuli, and each of the correlations was transformed into a z score using r to z transformation. A mean of these z scores was computed, and then this mean was transformed back to a correlation coefficient. The results are presented in Table 1 and show that: 1) The two measures of attention are extremely highly correlated, as are the two measures of attitude. 2) The following variables are related to the construct of engagement: engagement time, attention, attitude, manipulating object, and holding object. The variables disruptive and inappropriate are not correlated with engagement. 3) Although talking to the object and talking about the object are positively correlated with the engagement variables, the correlations are much lower than the correlations among the indicators of engagement. 4) The correlation between holding and manipulating indicated that those are highly related, though not identical, variables. Validity We correlated the average level of observed engagement of participants with the independent ratings of activity therapists employed at the nursing homes of the participants' level of involvement in activities. The activity therapists were asked to report on how often the resident had been involved in activities during the last 2 weeks, and the level of interest and activity the resident had shown with these activities. The activity therapists, like the research assistants, were completely unaware of the observational data. The results are shown in Table 2 . Whereas there were significant correlations between all the measures of observed engagement and the reports of the activity therapists, the highest correlations were between engagement time and the therapist's assessment of the frequency of the resident's involvement in activities, and between observed attention and the therapist's assessment of the level of activity of the resident during activities.

Discussion This paper lays the foundation for a new theoretical framework concerning the mechanisms of interactions between persons with cognitive impairment and environmental stimuli, as well as what factors are associated with interest and negative and positive feelings in engagement. Our study found that the most important dimensions of engagement are: refusal, attention and attitude. Engagement time is a global measure as it combines refusal and attention and therefore reflects an important clinical dimension. Future research is needed to investigate and, hopefully, disprove the common assumption that inactivity in dementia is a fixed part of the disease and therefore not a target for interventions. Moreover, research on engagement will add to the current theory of apathy in dementia, by clarifying the extent to which apathy is amenable to influence from setting characteristics. This paper presents an assessment of engagement of persons with dementia through direct observations. The measure includes the following dimensions of engagement: engagement time, attention, attitude, manipulating, and holding object. Inter-rater reliability has been documented, as well as construct validity through independent ratings of participants by activity therapists who were not involved with the observations. In future papers, we intend to describe the relationships between engagement and specific environment attributes, stimulus attributes, person attributes, and stimulus-person interactions. This paper lays the groundwork for such investigations. Our ongoing and future studies open a new field of applied systematic exploration of engagement of nursing home residents with dementia in appropriate activities. We believe that our framework provides an exciting prospect for improving quality of life in persons with dementia in that it involves a complex yet replicable manner for analyzing engagement, and thereby identifying straightforward plans for tailoring appropriate activities to individuals. Such an understanding provides the next step in the overall development and validation of nonpharmacological approaches that deal with appropriate activities. It may also be useful for understanding other populations with cognitive disabilities.
