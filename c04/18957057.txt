Conditioned media from mouse osteosarcoma cells promote MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation using JAKs and PI3-K/Akt signal crosstalk Summary The maintenance of bone mass requires a strict balance between bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. In tumoral bone environment, tumor cells frequently disturb this balance by interaction with bone cells to create a favorable site for tumor growth, and promote pathological bone changes. Thus, elucidation of the mechanisms underlying interaction between tumor cells and bone cells might eventually lead to a more rational strategy for therapeutic intervention for bone tumors and better understanding of bone biology. In this study, the effects of mouse osteosarcoma cells on mouse pre-osteoblastic cells were determined by assessment of cell viability, osteoblastic differentiation and signal transduction pathways. MOS-J/POS-1 conditioned media (CMs) significantly induced MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and reduced both alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralized nodule formation. Piceatannol, AG490, LY294002 and rapamycin significantly abrogated this up-regulated cell proliferation; however UO126 and STAT3 inhibitor peptide did not affect this up-regulated cell proliferation. MOS-J/POS-1 CMs activated ERK 1/2, STAT3 and Akt signal transduction pathways; however pro-proliferating signal induced by MOS-J/POS-1 CMs was transmitted via Akt not ERK 1/2 and STAT3 pathways. Furthermore, Western blot analyses clearly revealed novel signal crosstalk between JAKs and PI3-K/Akt in osteoblastic cells. The specific factor(s) involved in MOS-J/POS-1 CMs-induced MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation that use JAKs/PI3-K/Akt/mTOR pathway remain(s) to be determined. Determination of the specific factor(s) responsible for JAKs and PI3-K/Akt signal crosstalk that result in up-regulated pre-osteoblast proliferation will offer new insight to understand the pathology of osteosarcoma as well as other bone-related diseases.  Materials and methods Cell culture MOS-J [ 5 ] and POS-1 [ 6 , 7 ] cell lines were derived from spontaneous mouse osteosarcoma. MOS-J was obtained from The Jackson laboratory (ME, USA) and POS-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Kamijo (Kanagawa Cancer Center, Kanagawa, Japan). MOS-J and POS-1 cells represent respectively osteogenic and undifferentiated phenotype. MC3T3-E1, a mouse calvaria-derived pre-osteoblast cell line was obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone, Brebières, France), at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air. The medium was changed twice a week and adherent cells were harvested using 0.05% trypsin-0.02% EDTA solution (Lonza). Preparation of conditioned media from osteosarcoma cells Conditioned media from MOS-J and POS-1 cells (MOS-J CM, POS-1 CM) were prepared as previously described with slight modifications [ 8 ]. MOS-J or POS-1 cells (104 cells/cm2) were grown in a 25cm2 flask until 70-80% confluence in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Then, cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Lonza) and the medium was changed into serum-free RPMI 1640. After 24 h, CMs were collected and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min and stored at -80°C until use. The same volume of serum-free RPMI 1640 in the same conditions without cells was used as a control CM (CT CM). Cell viability assays -XTT test The proliferation of mouse pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells was determined as previously reported with some modifications [ 8 ]. MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded into a 96-multiwell plate (2.8 × 103 cells/well) and cultured for 72 h in CT CM or MOS-J/POS-1 CMs supplemented with 5% FBS. The media were changed every 48 h and cell proliferation was determined by a sodium 3? [1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) based method using Cell Proliferation Kit II (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) following the supplier’s recommendations. Take into account of the result of signal transduction analyses in this study as well as the common knowledge that MEK/ERK, Janus kinases (JAKs), signal transducer and activator of transduction (STAT), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways were frequently implicated in cell proliferation; the following inhibitors were tested: MEK/ERK inhibitor (UO126, 10 ?M, Calbiochem, CA, USA), a JAK1 inhibitor (piceatannol, 10 ?M, Calbiochem), a JAK2 inhibitor (AG490, 20 ?M, Calbiochem), a JAK3 inhibitor (JAK3 Inhibitor I, 10 ?M, Calbiochem), a STAT3 inhibitor (STAT3 inhibitor peptide, 50 ?M, Calbiochem), a PI3-K inhibitor (LY294002, 20 ?M, Calbiochem) and a mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin, 10 nM, Calbiochem). These inhibitors were tested to identify which signal transduction pathway plays a crucial role in MOS-J/POS-1 CMs-induced MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation. These inhibitors were added 1 h before of the treatment by osteosarcoma CMs except for AG490 that was added 16 h before. All inhibitors were maintained until the end of culture period at the indicated concentrations. In addition, several neutralizing antibodies were also tested to detect the specific factor(s) that play a pivotal role in MOS-J/POS-1 CMs-induced MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation in the same experimental conditions except for the concentrations of CMs (50% vol/vol were used). Anti-mouse interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antibody (anti-IL-6R, 10 ?g/ml, R&D systems, MN, USA), anti-mouse IL-11 receptor antibody (anti-IL-11R, 100 ?g/ml, R&D systems), anti-mouse gp130 antibody (anti-gp130, 20 ?g/ml, R&D systems), anti-mouse insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I antibody (anti-IGF-I, 20 ?g/ml, R&D systems) and anti-mouse IGF-II antibody (anti-IGF-II, 20 ?g/ml, R&D systems) were tested. Anti-goat IgG (10, 20, 100 ?g/ml, R&D systems) was used as a control. These antibodies were pre-incubated for 1 h at 37°C with MC3T3-E1 cells or MOS-J/POS-1 CMs and maintained during the culture period at the indicated concentrations. Furthermore, since cell proliferation test with suramin indicated the involvement of growth factor(s) in MOS-J/POS-1 CMs-induced up-regulate MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation, several recombinant cytokines/growth factors were analyzed to determine whether these factors mimic MOS-J/POS-1 CMs effects on MC3T3-E1 cells. Recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF, 100 ng/ml, R&D systems), human growth hormone (rhGH, 100 ng/ml, Lilly France, France), human IL-6 (rhIL-6, 100 ng/ml, R&D systems) alone or association with human soluble IL-6R (rhIL-6Rs:rhIL-6 = 500 ng/ml:100 ng/ml, R&D systems), human IL-11 (rhIL-11, 100 ng/ml, R&D systems), human leukemia inhibitory factor (rhLIF, 100 ng/ml, R&D systems) and human IGF-I (rhIGF-I, 100 ng/ml, R&D systems) were employed and MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation was determined in the presence or absence of these factors. - Manual cell counting using trypan blue exclusion method Trypan blue exclusion was used to quantify the viable and dead cells. MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded into a 24-multiwell plate (5 × 103 cells/well) and cultured in CT CM or MOS-J/POS-1 CMs supplemented with 5% FBS, then the viable and dead cell numbers were determined at day 1, 4 and 7. Furthermore, under the same experimental conditions, MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of suramin, a pan-growth factor blocker (50-200 ?g/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation was measured by direct cell counting using trypan blue exclusion method, as suramin may interfere with cell proliferation assays based on mitochondrial enzyme activity [ 9 ]. Signal transduction analyses by Western blot Signal transduction analyses were performed as previously described with slight modifications [ 8 ]. Briefly, MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded (104 cells/cm2) into a 6-multiwell plate in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. At 70-80% of confluence, MC3T3-E1 cells were washed three times with serum-free RPMI 1640 and serum starved for 24 h, and then the cells were incubated for 30 min with CT CM. After that MC3T3-E1 cells were incubated for 2, 5, 10, 15 and 30 min in the presence or absence of MOS-J/POS-1 CMs. In the experiments designed to determine the responsible signal transduction pathway for MOS-J/POS-1 CMs-induced MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation, several signal transduction inhibitors were used as described above. After pre-treatment with these inhibitors, MC3T3-E1 cells were then cultured in the presence or absence of MOS-J/POS-1 CMs for 15 min. In addition, to elucidate the signal transduction pathways activated by IL-6 family cytokines (rhIL-6 alone, rhIL-6+rhIL-6Rs, rhIL-11 and rhLIF), MC3T3-E1 cells were similarly treated for 15 min in the presence of these cytokines at the same concentrations as described above. After the treatments, the cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer (NaCl 150 mM, Tris 50 mM, Nonidet P-40 1%, sodium deoxycholate 0.25%, NaF 1 mM, NaVO4 1 mM, leupeptine 10 mg/ml, aprotinin 10 mg/ml, PMSF 0.5 mM) and same amounts of proteins were subjected to the study. The induction of the phosphorylated forms of ERK 1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), STAT1 (Tyr701), STAT3 (Tyr705) (Cell Signaling Technologies, MA, USA), STAT5 (Tyr694, ZYMED Laboratories, CA, USA), Akt (Ser473) and mTOR (Ser2448, Cell Signaling Technologies) were determined as well as total forms of ERK 1/2 (Cell Signaling Technologies), p38 (R&D systems), STAT1, STAT3, STAT5 (BD Biosciences, CA, USA), Akt and actin (Cell Signaling Technologies) according to the manufacture’s instructions, and revealed using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, USA). Characterization of mouse osteosarcoma cell lines - RNA extraction and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis Total RNA was extracted from the mouse osteosarcoma cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Eragny, France) following manufacturer’s recommendations. First, total RNA (5 ?g) was reverse transcribed (RT) into cDNA using 400 U MMLV-RT (Invitrogen) and 0.5 ?g random primers (Promega, WI, USA). Two microliters of the RT products were subjected to PCR using 1.25 U of Ampli Taq Gold (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) and upstream and downstream primers (20 pmol each) to determine the expression of IL-6 [5’-ccggagaggagacttcacag-3’ (sense), 5’-ggaaattggggtaggaagga-3’ (anti-sense)], IL-11 [5’-tgtggggacatgaactgtgt-3’ (sense), 5’-tactcgaagccttgtcagca-3’ (anti-sense)], IGF-I [5’-tggatgctcttcagttcgtg-3’ (sense), 5’-gtcttgggcatgtcagtgtg-3’ (anti-sense)], IGF-II [5’-ggaagtcgatgttggtgctt-3’ (sense), 5’-cgtttggcctctctgaactc-3’ (anti-sense)], LIF [5’-acggcaacctcatgaaccaga-3’ (sense), 5’-ctagaaggcctggaccaccac-3’ (anti-sense)], oncostatin M (OSM) [5’-cctgaacacacctgacctga-3’ (sense), 5’-cgatggtatccccagagaaa-3’ (anti-sense)] and 18S [5’-tcaagaacgaaagtcggaggtc-3’ (sense), 5’-ttattgctcaatctcgggtggct-3’ (anti-sense)]. The thermal cycle profile was as follows: denaturation for 30 sec at 95°C, annealing for 30 sec at 60°C (IL-11, IGF-I, IGF-II) and 62°C (IL-6, LIF, OSM, 18S) respectively, and extension for 60 sec at 72°C. After the number of PCR cycles was increased, a plot was done for each sample and the cycle values corresponding to the linear part of the amplification curve were determined and used to quantify the messages versus the 18S signal determined in the same way. The cycle number used was 30 cycles for IL-6, LIF, 35 cycles for IL-11, OSM, IGF-I, IGF-II and 20 cycles for 18S, respectively. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel and stained by GelRed (Biotium, CA, USA). The mRNA levels of each gene were standardized to 18S levels. Osteoblastic differentiation assays -Measurement of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was determined in primary cultured mouse calvaria-derived osteoblastic cells and MC3T3-E1 cells as previously reported with slight modifications [ 8 ]. Briefly, primary cultured mouse calvaria-derived osteoblastic cells isolated as previously described [ 10 ] or MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded into a 24-multiwell plate (5 × 103 cells/well) in CT CM or MOS-J/POS-1 CMs supplemented with 5% FBS in the presence of 50 ?g/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). Culture medium was changed every 48 h and cultured for 7 days. At the end of the culture period, the cells were lyzed in ice-cold buffer [NaCl 150 mM, Tris 50 mM, Nonidet P-40 1%, sodium deoxycholate 0.25%, NaF 1 mM, leupeptine 10 mg/ml, aprotinin 10 mg/ml, PMSF 0.5 mM]. ALP activity was determined by U /?g protein using Enzyline PAL optimisé (bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Etoile, France) according to the supplier’s instructions. - Mineralization assay Alizarin red-S staining was used to detect the mineralized nodule formations in vitro as previously reported with slight modifications [ 8 ]. In brief, primary cultured mouse calvaria-derived osteoblastic cells were seeded (104 cells/cm2) into a 24-multiwell plate in CT CM or MOS-J/POS-1 CMs supplemented with 10% FBS containing 10-8 M dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 ?g/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mM Na-?-glycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich). The culture medium was changed every 48 h and cultured for 2.5 weeks. In the same experimental conditions, MC3T3-E1 cells were maintained for 4.5 weeks. Adherent cells were washed with PBS, and then fixed by ice-cold 70% ethanol for 1 h. The fixed cells were washed with distilled water and incubated with alizarin red-S (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, 40 mM, pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature. After extensive washing, the presence of mineralized nodules was counted by light microscope. Mineralized nodules were counted in three random fields and were averaged for each condition. Statistical analyses Represented data are the results of three independent studies at least. Mann-Whitney’s U test was used to assess differences in experimental groups. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.  Cell culture MOS-J [ 5 ] and POS-1 [ 6 , 7 ] cell lines were derived from spontaneous mouse osteosarcoma. MOS-J was obtained from The Jackson laboratory (ME, USA) and POS-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Kamijo (Kanagawa Cancer Center, Kanagawa, Japan).

Two microliters of the RT products were subjected to PCR using 1.25 U of Ampli Taq Gold (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) and upstream and downstream primers (20 pmol each) to determine the expression of IL-6 [5’-ccggagaggagacttcacag-3’ (sense), 5’-ggaaattggggtaggaagga-3’ (anti-sense)], IL-11 [5’-tgtggggacatgaactgtgt-3’ (sense), 5’-tactcgaagccttgtcagca-3’ (anti-sense)], IGF-I [5’-tggatgctcttcagttcgtg-3’ (sense), 5’-gtcttgggcatgtcagtgtg-3’ (anti-sense)], IGF-II [5’-ggaagtcgatgttggtgctt-3’ (sense), 5’-cgtttggcctctctgaactc-3’ (anti-sense)], LIF [5’-acggcaacctcatgaaccaga-3’ (sense), 5’-ctagaaggcctggaccaccac-3’ (anti-sense)], oncostatin M (OSM) [5’-cctgaacacacctgacctga-3’ (sense), 5’-cgatggtatccccagagaaa-3’ (anti-sense)] and 18S [5’-tcaagaacgaaagtcggaggtc-3’ (sense), 5’-ttattgctcaatctcgggtggct-3’ (anti-sense)]. The thermal cycle profile was as follows: denaturation for 30 sec at 95°C, annealing for 30 sec at 60°C (IL-11, IGF-I, IGF-II) and 62°C (IL-6, LIF, OSM, 18S) respectively, and extension for 60 sec at 72°C. After the number of PCR cycles was increased, a plot was done for each sample and the cycle values corresponding to the linear part of the amplification curve were determined and used to quantify the messages versus the 18S signal determined in the same way. The cycle number used was 30 cycles for IL-6, LIF, 35 cycles for IL-11, OSM, IGF-I, IGF-II and 20 cycles for 18S, respectively. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel and stained by GelRed (Biotium, CA, USA). The mRNA levels of each gene were standardized to 18S levels.  - RNA extraction and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis Total RNA was extracted from the mouse osteosarcoma cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Eragny, France) following manufacturer’s recommendations.

Osteoblastic differentiation assays -Measurement of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was determined in primary cultured mouse calvaria-derived osteoblastic cells and MC3T3-E1 cells as previously reported with slight modifications [ 8 ]. Briefly, primary cultured mouse calvaria-derived osteoblastic cells isolated as previously described [ 10 ] or MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded into a 24-multiwell plate (5 × 103 cells/well) in CT CM or MOS-J/POS-1 CMs supplemented with 5% FBS in the presence of 50 ?g/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich).

Results -Soluble factor(s) produced by MOS-J/POS-1 cells promoted MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation To determine whether osteosarcoma cells produce soluble factor(s) that modulating cell survival and proliferation, osteoblast proliferation was analyzed in the presence of CMs from osteosarcoma cells. MOS-J/POS-1 CMs significantly promoted MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1A : MOS-J, B: POS-1). MOS-J CM induced approximately 20 % higher MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation compared to that of POS-1 CM ( Figure 1A-D ). Furthermore, soluble factor(s) secreted from MOS-J and POS-1 cells acted as survival factor(s) of MC3T3-E1 cells by increasing alive cell percentage ( Figure 1E ) and decreasing dead cell percentage ( Figure 1F ). To identify the factor(s) associated with the up-regulation of pre-osteoblast proliferation, the effects of several signal transduction inhibitors and cytokines/growth factors were assessed by cell proliferation tests. Suramin, a pan-growth factor blocker, significantly and dose-dependently attenuated the up-regulated MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation induced by both MOS-J CM ( Figure 2A ) and POS-1 CM ( Figure 2B ). This up-regulated proliferation was also attenuated in the presence of piceatannol, AG490, LY294002 or rapamycin ( Figure 2C ), whereas both UO126 and STAT3 inhibitor peptide had no significant effect ( Figure 2D ). -MOS-J/POS-1 CMs activated ERK 1/2, STAT3, Akt and mTOR signal transduction pathways in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cell When MC3T3-E1 cells were incubated in the presence of MOS-J/POS-1 CMs, an overt activation (phosphorylation) of ERK 1/2, STAT3 and Akt were observed after around 2 and 5 min and reached a plateau after 10 min for ERK1/2, 15 min for STAT3 and Akt, respectively ( Figure 3A ). Clear activation of mTOR by MOS-J/POS-1 CMs was also observed after 30 min incubation ( Figure 3B ). We could detect no activation of p38, STAT1 and STAT5. Furthermore, LY294002, piceatannol and AG490 completely abolished Akt phosphorylation ( Figure 3C ); while JAK3 inhibitor I did not affect Akt phosphorylation in MC3T3-E1 cells ( Figure 3C ). Similar to JAK3 inhibitor I, UO126 did not affect the MOS-J/POS-1 CMs-induced Akt status (data not shown). As the JAK/STAT signaling pathway was activated in MC3T3-E1 cells by MOS-J/POS-1 CMs, we analyzed the mRNA expression of IL-6 family cytokines, which are known to activate JAKs/STATs pathway, by osteosarcoma cells. Both MOS-J and POS-1 cells expressed IL-6, IL-11 and LIF transcripts, but not OSM. Therefore, STAT3 and Akt activation by these IL-6 family cytokines expressed by MOS-J/POS-1 cells were studied. These cytokines did not induce Akt phosphorylation, whereas STAT3 was clearly activated. As previous reported [ 11 ], IL-6 can remarkably activate STAT3 in association with its soluble receptor; however STAT3 phosphorylation was slightly induced by IL-6 alone. STAT3 phosphorylation induced by IL-6 family cytokines was significantly abrogated in the presence of anti-gp130. Furthermore, neither all recombinant cytokines/growth factors tested (rhEGF, rhGH, rhIL-6, rhIL-6+rhIL-6Rs, rhIL-11, rhLIF, rhIGF-I) nor neutralizing antibodies (anti-IL-6R, anti-IL-11R, anti-gp130, anti-IGF-I, anti-IGF-II) did not allow to identify the responsible factor produced by MOS-J/POS-1 cells which promoted MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation (data not shown). -The effects of MOS-J/POS-1 cells on osteoblastic differentiation MOS-J/POS-1 CMs significantly reduced ALP activity of MC3T3-E1 cells compared to CT CM [CT CM vs MOS-J/POS-1 CMs (mean ± SD, U /?g protein): 0.44 ± 0.064 vs 0.20 ± 0.043/ 0.23 ± 0.078, p =0.02]; however there was no significant difference of ALP activity between MOS-J CM and POS-1 CM ( p =0.77). In addition, MOS-J/POS-1 CMs significantly reduced mineralized nodule formation by MC3T3-E1 cells compared to CT CM [CT CM vs MOS-J/POS-1 CMs (mean ± SD): 41 ± 14 vs 11 ± 5/ 5 ± 4, p =0.0039] ( Figure 4 ). MOS-J CM induced clearly bigger and a large number of mineralized nodules compared to those of POS-1 CM (MOS-J CM vs POS-1 CM: 11 ± 5 vs 5 ± 4, p =0.045) ( Figure 4 ). POS-1 CM scarcely induced small mineralized nodules. The congruent data were obtained from primary cultured mouse calvaria-derived osteoblastic cells (data not shown).

Discussion In the present study, we first assessed whether the CMs from MOS-J/POS-1 osteosarcoma cells modulated MC3T3-E1 cell viability and found a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on cell proliferation. As suramin, a pan-growth factor blocker, dose-dependently inhibited the effect of MOS-J/POS-1 CMs on MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation, we considered that MOS-J/POS-1 cells produced more than one kind of growth factor which drastically promoted MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation. Interestingly, the present study demonstrated that JAKs/PI3-K/Akt/mTOR pathway, not ERK 1/2 and STAT3, played a crucial role in significantly promoted MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation induced by MOS-J/POS-1 CMs. Moreover, clear signal crosstalk between JAKs (JAK1 and JAK2) and PI3-K/Akt cascades was revealed and PI3-K/Akt was downstream target of JAKs ( Figure 5 ). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of JAKs and PI3-K/Akt signal crosstalk in osteoblastic cells. Such signal crosstalk has been reported as an optimal anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferating signal in other tumor cells, including multiple myeloma [ 12 - 14 ], hepatoma [ 15 ] and basal cell carcinoma cells [ 16 ]. In agreement with these reports, this signal also played an essential role in dramatically promoted MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cell proliferation and survival. Upstream signaling between cytokine/growth factor receptors and PI3-K is not fully determined. JAKs are implicated in cytokines/growth hormones’ signaling and are crucial components of diverse signal transduction pathways that govern cellular survival, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [ 17 ]. While the STATs are well known and the most investigated downstream target of JAKs, other targets of JAKs have been identified [ 17 ]. Indeed, emerging evidence has revealed that JAK kinase function is required for optimal activation of the Src-kinase cascade, the Ras-MAP kinase pathway and the PI3-K/Akt pathway [ 17 ]. In JAKs-induced PI3-K activation, several studies have reported the involvement of the p85 subunit of PI3-K [ 18 ], insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (IRS-1, IRS-2 and IRS-3) [ 19 ] and gp130 subunit [ 20 ]. Taken together, these studies indicate that the cellular signal transduction machinery is programmed to respond to changes in stimuli by integrating diverse signaling pathways to generate an orchestrated response. In these reports, IL-6 family cytokines acted as an inducer of JAKs and PI3-K signal crosstalk [ 12 - 16 , 20 ]. We have therefore carefully examined the effect of IL-6 family cytokines. In addition, several growth factors were also examined; since suramin, a pan-growth factor abolished MOS-J/POS-1 CMs-induced MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation. Thus, IL-6, IL-11, LIF, OSM, EGF, GH, IGF-I and IGF-II have been excluded and the specific factor(s) remain to be determined. It is likely that these cytokine/growth hormone cocktails can uniquely display pro-proliferating effects on pre-osteoblast cells via JAKs and PI3-K/Akt signal crosstalk by their synergic effect. It has been reported that the rate of bone formation and bone resorption is largely determined by the numbers of bone-forming (osteoblast) and bone-resorbing (osteoclast) cells in the adult skeleton [ 21 ]. Thus, the determination of the specific factor(s) and optimal pre-osteoblast cell pro-proliferating signals undoubtedly will lead to unprecedented therapeutic approach for bone-loss diseases such as osteoporosis. The JAKs and PI3-K/Akt signal crosstalk is a good candidate of such signals. MOS-J/POS-1 CMs significantly reduced mineralized nodule formations by pre-osteoblastic cells. MOS-J CM could induce bigger and a large number of mineralized nodules compared to those induced by POS-1 CM. MOS-J model mice [ 5 ] demonstrated clearly more osteogenic tumors compared to the POS-1 model [ 7 ]. Thus, our findings can explain, at least in part, why MOS-J model demonstrated more osteogenic profile than POS-1 model. In conclusion, the present study reveals clear interaction between osteosarcoma cells and bone cells. The pre-osteoblast cell proliferation induced by osteosarcoma cells may play, at least in part, a role in the osteoblastic profile of osteosarcoma. Furthermore, novel JAKs and PI3-K/Akt signal crosstalk that induces pre-osteoblast cell proliferation, one of the principal results obtained from the present study, will offer novel insight into the osteosarcoma biology as well as the therapeutic capability for all bone-related diseases such as osteoporosis.  Discussion In the present study, we first assessed whether the CMs from MOS-J/POS-1 osteosarcoma cells modulated MC3T3-E1 cell viability and found a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on cell proliferation. As suramin, a pan-growth factor blocker, dose-dependently inhibited the effect of MOS-J/POS-1 CMs on MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation, we considered that MOS-J/POS-1 cells produced more than one kind of growth factor which drastically promoted MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation. Interestingly, the present study demonstrated that JAKs/PI3-K/Akt/mTOR pathway, not ERK 1/2 and STAT3, played a crucial role in significantly promoted MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation induced by MOS-J/POS-1 CMs. Moreover, clear signal crosstalk between JAKs (JAK1 and JAK2) and PI3-K/Akt cascades was revealed and PI3-K/Akt was downstream target of JAKs ( Figure 5 ). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of JAKs and PI3-K/Akt signal crosstalk in osteoblastic cells. Such signal crosstalk has been reported as an optimal anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferating signal in other tumor cells, including multiple myeloma [ 12 - 14 ], hepatoma [ 15 ] and basal cell carcinoma cells [ 16 ]. In agreement with these reports, this signal also played an essential role in dramatically promoted MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cell proliferation and survival. Upstream signaling between cytokine/growth factor receptors and PI3-K is not fully determined. JAKs are implicated in cytokines/growth hormones’ signaling and are crucial components of diverse signal transduction pathways that govern cellular survival, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [ 17 ]. While the STATs are well known and the most investigated downstream target of JAKs, other targets of JAKs have been identified [ 17 ]. Indeed, emerging evidence has revealed that JAK kinase function is required for optimal activation of the Src-kinase cascade, the Ras-MAP kinase pathway and the PI3-K/Akt pathway [ 17 ].
