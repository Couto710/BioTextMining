The History and Future of Chemotherapy for Melanoma Melanoma is considered a chemotherapy-resistant tumor, but in fact several chemotherapeutic agents show single-agent activity at the level of 10% to 15%, similar to the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic armamentarium used against other tumor types. Several combination chemotherapy regimens have been tested, but no survival benefit has been demonstrated. Few of these trials have been compared with standard dacarbazine (DTIC) in an adequately powered randomized trial, and even the largest of these trials were only powered to detect unrealistically large improvements in overall survival. In this article, the authors review past chemotherapy trials and the current state of chemotherapy for melanoma. Looking to the future, the authors are encouraged by recent observations that the addition of sorafenib to DTIC (or temozolomide) can increase response rates and survival. The authors suggest that this could form the core on which additional active chemotherapeutic drugs could be added with the hope of developing a regimen that improves overall survival. This paradigm of stepwise addition of active chemotherapeutic drugs has been successful in the development of chemotherapy regimens that improve survival in other solid tumor systems. In colon carcinoma, for example, the current regimens were built on fluorouracil (5FU)/leucovorin, which has similar activity to DTIC in melanoma. This could serve as a model for studies on melanoma.
