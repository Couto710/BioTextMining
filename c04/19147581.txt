PROTEIN KINASE C ?II AND PKC?/?: COLLABORATING PARTNERS IN COLON CANCER PROMOTION AND PROGRESSION We previously demonstrated that elevated expression of either protein kinase C?II (PKC?II) or PKC?/? enhances colon carcinogenesis in mice. Here we use novel bi-transgenic mice to determine the relative importance of PKC?II and PKC?/? in colon carcinogenesis in two complimentary models of colon cancer in vivo . Bi-transgenic mice over-expressing PKC?II and constitutively active PKC? (PKC?II/caPKC?) or kinase-deficient, dominant negative PKC? (PKC?II/kdPKC?) in the colon exhibit a similar increase in colon tumor incidence, tumor size and tumor burden in response to azoxymethane (AOM) when compared to non-transgenic littermates. However, PKC?II/kdPKC? mice develop predominantly benign colonic adenomas whereas PKC?II/caPKC? mice develop malignant carcinomas. In contrast, PKC? deficient (PKC??/?) mice fail to develop tumors even in the presence of caPKC?. Our previous data indicated that PKC?II drives tumorigenesis and proliferation by activating ?-catenin/Apc signaling. Consistent with this conclusion, genetic deletion of PKC? has no effect on spontaneous tumorigenesis in APCmin/+ mice. In contrast, tissue-specific knock out of PKC? significantly suppresses intestinal tumor formation in APCmin/+ mice. Our data demonstrate that PKC?II and PKC?/? serve distinct, non-overlapping functions in colon carcinogenesis. PKC?II is required for AOM-induced tumorigenesis, but is dispensable for tumor formation in ApcMin/+ mice. PKC?/? promotes tumor progression in both AOM- and APCmin/+-induced tumorigenesis. Thus PKC?II and PKC?, whose expression is elevated in both rodent and human colon tumors, collaborate to drive colon tumor formation and progression, respectively.  Introduction Colon cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States with an estimated 150,000 new cases and 50,000 deaths in 2008 ( 1 ). Colon carcinogenesis is a multi-step process involving progressive changes in signaling pathways that regulate colonic epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Prominent among these changes are those involving PKC signaling pathways (reviewed in ( 2 )). It is well-documented that colon carcinogenesis in rodents and humans is accompanied by specific changes in expression of PKC isozymes ( 2 – 6 ). We have previously shown that PKC?II expression is induced in preneoplastic colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF), and in tumors in AOM-treated mice ( 3 ). Elevated expression of PKC?II by transgenesis induces colonic epithelial hyperproliferation and increased susceptibility to colon carcinogenesis ( 4 ). PKC?II overexpression induces decreased GSK-3? activity and increased ?-catenin levels in the colonic epithelium in vivo , biochemical changes that are associated with the hyperproliferative phenotype of these mice ( 4 ). PKC?II also induces invasion of intestinal epithelial cells via a Ras/Mek-, PKC?/?, Rac 1-dependent signaling pathway in vitro ( 7 ). Like PKC?II, PKC?/? expression is induced during AOM-mediated colon carcinogenesis ( 3 , 5 ). Elevated PKC?/? expression is observed in AOM-induced tumors but not in ACF suggesting that PKC?/? may function later in the carcinogenic process ( 3 ). PKC?/? activity regulates susceptibility to oncogenic K-ras- and AOM-mediated colon carcinogenesis in transgenic mice ( 5 ) and expression of a constitutively active PKC? allele in the colonic epithelium leads to enhanced carcinogenesis after AOM treatment ( 5 ). Thus, both PKC?II and PKC?/? play important roles in colon carcinogenesis. However, the functional relationship between PKC?II and PKC?/? signaling during colon carcinogenesis has not been explored. Since overexpression of either PKC?II or PKC? can enhance colon carcinogenesis, it is possible that these PKC isozymes serve redundant functions the carcinogenic process. Alternatively, these PKC isozymes may collaborate to coordinately enhance carcinogenesis. In the present study, we examined the relative contribution of PKC?II and PKC?/? in AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis and in mutant APC- (ApcMin/+) mediated intestinal tumorigenesis using compound transgenic mice. Our results reveal that PKC?II and PKC?/? serve distinct, non-overlapping roles in colon carcinogenesis, conspiring to drive initiation and progression of colon carcinogenesis, respectively. PKC?II plays a requisite role in the earliest stages of carcinogen-induced colon carcinogenesis driving adenoma formation. However, PKC?II is dispensible for ApcMin/+-mediated tumorigenesis. In contrast, PKC?/? plays an important role in progression of AOM-induced colon tumors from adenoma to carcinoma, and is necessary for ApcMin/+-mediated tumorigenesis.  Materials and Methods Mouse Breeding and Maintenance Transgenic PKC?II, caPKC? and kdPKC? mice (which express human PKC?II, a constitutively active human PKC? allele or a kinase-deficient, dominant negative human PKC? allele respectively, in the colonic epithelium were generated, genotyped and characterized for transgene expression previously ( 4 , 5 ). Mice nullizygous for PKC? (PKC??/? mice) were generated as described previously ( 8 , 9 ). Bi-transgenic mice homozygous for both PKC?II and caPKC? transgenes (PKC?II/caPKC? mice), the PKC?II and kdPKC? transgenes (PKC?II/kdPKC? mice), or homozygous for both the caPKC? transgene and PKC? knockout allele (PKC??/?/caPKC? mice) were generated by breeding. These mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 genetic background to avoid potential strain differences in phenotype. ApcMin/+ mice and mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the mouse villin 1 promoter (Vil-cre) ( 10 ) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Floxed PKC? (PKC?fl/fl) mice expressing a conditional, Cre recombinase-inactivated PKC? knock out allele were generated as previously described ( 11 ). Bitransgenic ApcMin/+/PKC??/?, ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mice and tri-transgenic ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/Vil-cre mice were generated by breeding. Mice were housed in microisolator cages in a pathogen-free barrier facility and maintained at a constant temperature and humidity on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Mice were provided with a standard irradiated rodent chow and filtered water ad libitum throughout the experiments. It should be noted that the term PKC? refers to the human atypical PKC isoform derived from the PRKCI gene. PKC? refers to the mouse homolog of human PKC?. The term PKC?/? is used to refer to either the mouse or human atypical PKC? isozyme. Genetic Analysis of Transgenic Mice Genotypic analysis was performed using the protocols and primer sets described at the following web sites. 1 The presence of the loxP site in PKC? and Cre-mediated recombination at this site were detected by PCR analysis as described previously ( 11 ). Carcinogen Exposure and Tumor Analysis Transgenic mice were enrolled in a standard azoxymethane (AOM) carcinogen protocol at six weeks of age as described previously ( 3 ). Briefly, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg AOM or an equal volume of saline once a week for four weeks. Mice were harvested 36 weeks after the last AOM injection for analysis. Upon sacrifice, the colons were isolated, flushed with cold saline, slit open longitudinally and fixed flat in 10% buffered formalin. After 4 hours, the colons were washed in cold PBS and stored in 70% ethanol at 4°C prior to analysis. Fixed colons were stained briefly with 0.5% methylene blue and evaluated for the presence of tumors under a dissecting microscope using 20-fold magnification. The location and size of each tumor was recorded. Tumor volume was calculated as (length × width × width × 0.526). Colon tumors were isolated, along with adjacent normal epithelium and processed for histopathological examination. Characterization of Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>-mediated intestinal tumor formation At approximately six weeks of age, ApcMin/+ and ApcMin/+ compound transgenic mice were transferred from the standard rodent chow to high fat breeder chow (Teklad S-2335) and maintained on this diet until they were sacrificed at 120 days of age. At the time of sacrifice, the small intestine was isolated, divided evenly into three sections (ileum, duodenum and jejunum). The colon from cecum to rectum was also isolated. All intestinal sections were flushed with cold PBS, slit open longitudinally, and evaluated for tumor formation. Intestinal sections were then fixed flat in 4% formalin and subjected to immunohistochemistry. After deparaffinization and rehydration, sections were processed for antigen retrieval as described by the manufacturer (DAKO) and treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol to inhibit endogenous peroxidases. ?-catenin expression and subcellular localization was detected using mouse monoclonal anti- ?-catenin antibody (1:800; BD Transduction Labs) and detected with the Envision+Dual Link DAB detection system (DakoCytomation). Statistical Analysis Fisher Exact test was used to compare tumor incidence. t-Test was used to compare the means of tumor volume and tumor burden between experimental groups.  Mouse Breeding and Maintenance Transgenic PKC?II, caPKC? and kdPKC? mice (which express human PKC?II, a constitutively active human PKC? allele or a kinase-deficient, dominant negative human PKC? allele respectively, in the colonic epithelium were generated, genotyped and characterized for transgene expression previously ( 4 , 5 ). Mice nullizygous for PKC? (PKC??/? mice) were generated as described previously ( 8 , 9 ). Bi-transgenic mice homozygous for both PKC?II and caPKC? transgenes (PKC?II/caPKC? mice), the PKC?II and kdPKC? transgenes (PKC?II/kdPKC? mice), or homozygous for both the caPKC? transgene and PKC? knockout allele (PKC??/?/caPKC? mice) were generated by breeding. These mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 genetic background to avoid potential strain differences in phenotype. ApcMin/+ mice and mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the mouse villin 1 promoter (Vil-cre) ( 10 ) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Floxed PKC? (PKC?fl/fl) mice expressing a conditional, Cre recombinase-inactivated PKC? knock out allele were generated as previously described ( 11 ). Bitransgenic ApcMin/+/PKC??/?, ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mice and tri-transgenic ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/Vil-cre mice were generated by breeding. Mice were housed in microisolator cages in a pathogen-free barrier facility and maintained at a constant temperature and humidity on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle.

Results and Discussion PKC?II promotes AOM-induced adenoma formation in a PKC?-independent fashion We previously demonstrated that transgenic PKC?II mice, which overexpress PKC?II in the intestinal epithelium, are more susceptible to AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis ( 4 ). Consistent with our previous results, transgenic PKC?II mice exhibit a statistically significant increase in tumor incidence (20.5%) when compared to their non-transgenic littermates (5%) ( Figure 1A ). We have also implicated atypical PKC?/? in AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis in vivo ( 5 ). Since PKC?/? is an important component of at least some PKC?II-mediated signaling in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro ( 7 ) it is possible that PKC?/? is a downstream effector of PKC?II in colon carcinogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether PKC?/? is required for PKC?II to stimulate tumor formation in response to AOM using two bi-transgenic mouse lines. The first bi-transgenic line consisted of mice that over-express PKC?II and a constitutively active PKC? transgene in the intestinal epithelium (PKC?II/caPKC? mice). The second line consisted of mice that express PKC?II and a kinase deficient, dominant negative PKC? transgene in the intestinal epithelium (PKC?II/kdPKC? mice). Exposure of these two mouse lines to AOM induced formation of colon tumors at a similar incidence (23.7% vs. 20%) that is indistinguishable from that observed in PKC?II mice ( Figure 1B ). Though there was a trend toward a higher tumor incidence in PKC?II/caPKC? mice when compared to PKC?II or PKC?II/caPKC? mice, the difference between these genotypes did not reach statistical significance. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PKC?II plays a prominent role in tumor formation in response to AOM and indicate that PKC?II is dominant over PKC?/? in the process of tumor formation. To directly assess this point, we generated PKC? knock out mice (PKC??/? mice) expressing constitutively active PKC? (caPKC?) in the intestinal epithelium (PKC??/?/caPKC? mice). When these mice are treated with AOM, they failed to form tumors ( Figure 1B ) demonstrating that PKC? is absolutely required for tumor formation and that PKC?/? cannot substitute for PKC?II in the process of tumor initiation. Quantitative PCR analysis of PKC??/? mice demonstrated that these mice exhibit a selective loss of PKC? expression with no changes in expression of PKC?, PKC? or PKC? (data not shown). We previously reported that PKC? plays a critical role in the anchorage-independent growth of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro and NSCLC tumorigenicity in vivo ( 13 ). Therefore, it is possible that PKC?/? contributes to the growth of PKC?II-initiated colon tumors in AOM-treated mice. To test this hypothesis, we assessed tumor volume and tumor burden in non-transgenic, PKC?II/caPKC? and PKC?II/kdPKC? mice. Both PKC?II/caPKC? and PKC?II/kdPKC? mice exhibited an increase in tumor volume ( Figure 1C ) and tumor burden ( Figure 1D ) when compared to non-transgenic littermates. The increase in tumor volume and burden in PKC?II/dnPKC? and PKC?II/caPKC? mice was not significantly different, though we observed a trend toward smaller tumors and lower tumor burden in PKC?II/dnPKC? mice. These data clearly indicate that PKC?/? plays a relatively minor role in the growth of PKC?II-initiated colon tumors. We previously demonstrated that PKC?II drives colon tumor formation by stimulating proliferation of colonic epithelial cells in vivo ( 4 ). Our current data demonstrate that PKC?II is required for AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis, and indicate that PKC?II promotes colon tumor formation by promoting tumor proliferation in a manner that is largely independent of PKC?/?. PKC?/?, on the other hand, plays a relatively minor role in tumor initiation and growth in the presence of elevated PKC?II and cannot drive tumor formation in the absence of PKC?. PKC?/? drives the adenoma to carcinoma progression in AOM-induced colon tumors Our initial studies on PKC isozyme expression during AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis demonstrated that PKC?II expression was induced very early in the carcinogenesis process. Elevated PKC?II levels were observed in both aberrant crypt foci (ACF), early pre-neoplastic lesions in the colon, and in subsequent colon tumors ( 3 ). We also demonstrated that PKC?/? expression is elevated in AOM-induced tumors suggesting that elevated PKC?/? expression is functionally linked to colon carcinogenesis at later stages in this model ( 5 ). Consistent with this finding, transgenic caPKC? mice often develop intramucosal carcinomas rather than adenomas when treated with AOM ( 5 ). Therefore, we assessed whether PKC? plays a similar role in tumor progression in our bi-transgenic mice. Pathologic analysis of tumors from PKC?II/kdPKC? and PKC?II/caPKC? mice treated with AOM revealed that PKC?II/kdPKC? mice developed predominantly benign adenomas (7/8 tumors classified as adenoma), retaining significant tissue polarity and crypt-like structure comparable to those produced in non-transgenic mice ( Figure 2A and B ). In sharp contrast, the majority of tumors (8/11) in PKC?II/caPKC? mice contained foci exhibiting progression to malignant carcinoma (p=0.015 compared to PKC?II/kdPKC? mice). Colon carcinomas in PKC?II/caPKC? mice were characterized by the presence of disorganized sheets of epithelial tumor cells, disruption of normal crypt-like glandular architecture and loss of baso-lateral to apical cell polarity ( Figure 2C ). These data are consistent with our previous observation regarding PKC? and colon tumor progression ( 5 ). PKC?II is dispensable for intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice PKC?II-induced intestinal epithelial cell proliferation is associated with activation of the APC/?-catenin proliferative signaling pathway and is characterized by increased GSK3? activity and stabilization of ?-catenin in the colonic epithelium in vivo ( 4 ). Our current data are consistent with the hypothesis that PKC?II promotes AOM-induced tumorigenesis by activating the APC/?-catenin proliferative signaling pathway. Transgenic PKC?II mice exhibit decreased GSK3? activity in the colonic epithelium in vivo ( 4 ), consistent with the finding that PKC?II can directly phosphorylate GSK3? at Serine 9, a phosphorylation event that inhibits GSK3? activity ( 14 ). GSK3? inhibition leads to stabilization of ?-catenin by inhibiting APC-mediated proteosomal degradation, providing a plausible mechanism by which PKC?II can stabilize ?-catenin. If ?-catenin is a critical effector of PKC?II-mediated colon tumorigenesis, one would predict that the requirement for PKC?II to promote tumorigenesis might be alleviated in mice containing an inactivating APC mutation, which serves to stabilize ?-catenin independent of GSK3?. To test this hypothesis, we crossed PKC??/? with ApcMin/+ mice to produce ApcMin/+/PKC??/? mice. As expected, ApcMin/+/PKC??/? mice exhibit undetectable levels of PKC?II mRNA in the intestinal tract as determined by QPCR, confirming the lack of PKC? expression ( Figure 3A ). In contrast, ApcMin/+ mice express abundant PKC?II mRNA in the intestine ( Figure 3A ). ApcMin/+ and ApcMin/+/PKC??/? mice exhibited no change in expression of the other PKC isozymes implicated in colon tumorigenesis, PKC?, PKC? or PKC? ( Figure 3A ). Tumor analysis revealed no change in the number of intestinal tumors between these two genotypes ( Figure 3B ). Further analysis of tumor development in the colon and the small intestine separately also revealed no change in tumor number or distribution in these organs ( Figure 3C ). Likewise, there was no significant change in tumor number or distribution within the three major regions of the small intestine, the duodenum, jejunum and ileum in these mice ( Figure 3D ). Analysis of tumor burden and average tumor size also revealed no change between these genotypes (data not shown). We conclude that PKC? is dispensable for intestinal tumorigenesis in ApcMin/+ mice. Our data are consistent with the conclusion that PKC?II promotes AOM-mediated colon carcinogenesis by stabilizing ?-catenin and driving tumor proliferation, whereas in ApcMin/+ mice, ?-catenin is stabilized by loss of APC function, thereby eliminating the need for PKC?II. PKC?/? is important for intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice We next assessed whether PKC?/? plays a role in intestinal tumorigenesis in ApcMin/+ mice. To address this question, we generated a compound transgenic mouse line consisted of ApcMin/+ mice crossed to mice harboring a floxed PKC? allele that supports conditional, Cre recombinase-mediated inactivation of the PKC? allele (ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mice). ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mouse were then crossed to a villin-Cre mouse that expresses Cre-recombinase constitutively in the intestinal tract under the control of the tissue-specific villin promoter to produce ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin Cre mice. ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl littermates from this cross served as a negative control in these experiments. QPCR analysis of intestinal epithelium isolated from ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mice and ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin Cre mice demonstrated a significant decrease in PKC? mRNA expression in the intestinal epithelium of ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin Cre mice when compared to ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mice ( Figure 4A ). Despite the loss of PKC? expression in the intestinal tract, ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin Cre mice were viable and showed no morbidity or breeding problems. The intestinal epithelium of these mice exhibited no obvious morphological changes in crypt or villus architecture, polarity or organization ( Figure 4B ). Furthermore, the baso-lateral membrane distribution and intensity of ?-catenin in the intestine of these mice was indistinguishable from that observed in ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mice ( Figure 4C ). Thus, Cre mediated knock out of PKC? in the intestinal epithelium has no obvious detrimental consequence on intestinal epithelial tissue architecture, function or polarity. ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mice develop numerous tumors that carpet the intestinal epithelium ( Figure 5A ). However, ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin Cre mice develop significantly fewer intestinal tumors than ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mice ( Figure 5A ). Interestingly, ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin-Cre mice exhibited a decrease in tumor number in the small intestine but not the colon ( Figure 5B ). It is unclear whether this observation reflects a differential function for PKC? in the colon and small intestine, or is due to the smaller number of colon tumors induced in the colon in this model. ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin-Cre mice developed fewer tumors in all regions of the small intestine indicating that PKC?/? is important for tumorigenesis throughout the small intestine ( Figure 5C ). Pathologic and immunohistochemical analysis of tumors from ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl and ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin-Cre mice revealed that both genotypes produced adenomas exhibiting elevated expression and nuclear localization of ?-catenin characteristic of the ApcMin/+ phenotype ( Figure 5D ). Thus, our data demonstrate that PKC?/? plays an important role in ApcMin/+ tumorigenesis. Our results are interesting in light of the observed changes in PKC isozyme expression in AOM- and ApcMin/+-induced carcinogenesis models. We previously demonstrated that both PKC?II and PKC?/? expression is elevated during AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis, albeit with different kinetics ( 3 ). Our current study demonstrates the importance of both of these changes in driving distinct, complimentary aspects of colon tumor development. We have also observed a loss of PKC? expression in AOM-induced ACF and tumors ( 3 ), and intestinal tumors from APCmin mice exhibit changes in PKC isozyme expression similar to those observed in AOM-induced colon tumors ( 6 ). Specifically, PKC? and PKC?/? expression is elevated in intestinal tumors of ApcMin/+ mice whereas the expression of PKC? and PKC? is reduced in these tumors when compared to surrounding normal intestinal epithelium ( 6 ). Although the functional importance of the loss of PKC? expression has not yet been elucidated in the AOM model of colon carcinogenesis, PKC? loss drives tumorigenesis in the context of ApcMin/+ ( 6 ). Nullizygous PKC? (PKC??/?) mice exhibit enhanced ApcMin/+-mediated tumorigenesis, and spontaneous intestinal tumor formation in the absence of ApcMin/+, demonstrating that PKC? acts as a tumor suppressor in the intestinal tract ( 6 ). In contrast, nullizygous PKC? mice exhibited no change in susceptibility to ApcMin/+mediated tumors. Our present results demonstrate that atypical PKC? and PKC?/? play distinct, non-redundant roles in colon carcinogenesis. Whereas PKC? is dispensable for ApcMin/+ mediated tumorigenesis ( 6 ), PKC? plays a key role in both AOM-and ApcMin/+-induced carcinogenesis. These results are consistent with our findings in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) where we have shown that PKC?, but not PKC?, is specifically overexpressed in human primary NSCLC tumors and NSCLC cell lines ( 13 , 15 ). Expression of dominant negative, kdPKC? or RNAi-mediated knock down of PKC? expression, leads to inhibition of anchorage-independent growth and invasion of NSCLC cell in vitro , and loss of NSCLC cell tumorigenicity in vivo ( 13 , 15 , 16 ). In contrast, RNAi mediated knock down of PKC? has no effect on either anchorage-independent growth or invasion NSCLC cells ( 16 ). Our studies indicate that analysis of PKC isozyme expression patterns in various tumor models provides important clues to the role of specific PKC isozymes in tumorigenesis; however transgenic models such those employed here and in our previous studies ( 4 , 5 , 6 ) are essential to definitively investigate the functional role of individual PKC isozymes, and of changes in PKC isozyme expression, in physiologic and pathologic processes in vivo . Our data also demonstrate for the first time that two PKC isozymes implicated in colon carcinogenesis, PKC?II and PKC?/?, play distinct, non-redundant roles in colon tumorigenesis. Furthermore, our data provide compelling evidence that individual PKC isozymes often cannot compensate for the loss of another, highly related PKC isozyme to perform a similar function. Our results have important implications for the use of therapeutic agents targeting the PKC? and PKC?/? isozymes since drugs targeting both of these PKC isozymes are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Enzastaurin is a potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of PKC? that has shown clinical activity in glioma and B-cell lymphoma ( 17 – 19 ). Enzastaurin has also shown promise in pre-clinical xenograft models of hepatocellular carcinoma and colon carcinoma ( 20 , 21 ). Our results indicate that Enzastaurin may also be useful in colon cancer, particularly in the setting of chemoprevention. In this regard, we have found that colonic PKC?II is a relevant target of the chemopreventive activity of dietary ?-3 fatty acids ( 12 ). Enzastaurin is extremely well tolerated ( 22 , 23 ), making it a viable candidate for chemoprevention/chemo-intervention in the context of high risk colon cancer patients. However, since APC/?-catenin mutations are a prevalent event in both sporadic and familial colon cancers, PKC?-directed therapy may be most effective in very early chemoprevention strategies against colon cancer, prior to acquisition of an activating mutation in ?-catenin or loss of Apc tumor suppressor activity. In contrast, our data indicate that PKC? may be a more useful chemotherapeutic target for the treatment of advanced colon cancers that have acquired Apc/?-catenin and/or K-ras mutations. We have shown that PKC? is required for oncogenic K-ras mediated transformation both in the colon and the lung in vitro and in vivo ( 5 , 13 ). Our present data demonstrate that PKC?/? is also necessary for Apc/?-atenin mediated tumorigenesis in vivo . Since K-ras, ?-catenin and Apc mutations are observed in the majority of human colon cancers, PKC? inhibition may be an attractive strategy for treatment of these tumors. We have recently discovered a novel small molecule inhibitor of PKC?/?, aurothiomalate (ATM), that shows good anti-tumor activity non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in pre-clinical models ( 24 – 26 ). We recently demonstrated that elevated expression of PKC? in NSCLC is associated with enhanced response to PKC?-targeted therapy with ATM ( 26 ). Since PKC? expression is elevated in AOM-induced colon tumors ( 5 ), tumors in ApcMin/+ mice ( 6 ) and primary human colon tumors ( 5 ), these tumors may also be responsive to PKC?-targeted therapy. Future studies will be required to assess the efficacy of Enzastaurin and ATM in colon carcinogenesis in these models.  PKC?II promotes AOM-induced adenoma formation in a PKC?-independent fashion We previously demonstrated that transgenic PKC?II mice, which overexpress PKC?II in the intestinal epithelium, are more susceptible to AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis ( 4 ). Consistent with our previous results, transgenic PKC?II mice exhibit a statistically significant increase in tumor incidence (20.5%) when compared to their non-transgenic littermates (5%) ( Figure 1A ). We have also implicated atypical PKC?/? in AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis in vivo ( 5 ). Since PKC?/? is an important component of at least some PKC?II-mediated signaling in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro ( 7 ) it is possible that PKC?/? is a downstream effector of PKC?II in colon carcinogenesis.

The first bi-transgenic line consisted of mice that over-express PKC?II and a constitutively active PKC? transgene in the intestinal epithelium (PKC?II/caPKC? mice). The second line consisted of mice that express PKC?II and a kinase deficient, dominant negative PKC? transgene in the intestinal epithelium (PKC?II/kdPKC? mice). Exposure of these two mouse lines to AOM induced formation of colon tumors at a similar incidence (23.7% vs. 20%) that is indistinguishable from that observed in PKC?II mice ( Figure 1B ). Though there was a trend toward a higher tumor incidence in PKC?II/caPKC? mice when compared to PKC?II or PKC?II/caPKC? mice, the difference between these genotypes did not reach statistical significance. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PKC?II plays a prominent role in tumor formation in response to AOM and indicate that PKC?II is dominant over PKC?/? in the process of tumor formation.

Therefore, it is possible that PKC?/? contributes to the growth of PKC?II-initiated colon tumors in AOM-treated mice. To test this hypothesis, we assessed tumor volume and tumor burden in non-transgenic, PKC?II/caPKC? and PKC?II/kdPKC? mice. Both PKC?II/caPKC? and PKC?II/kdPKC? mice exhibited an increase in tumor volume ( Figure 1C ) and tumor burden ( Figure 1D ) when compared to non-transgenic littermates. The increase in tumor volume and burden in PKC?II/dnPKC? and PKC?II/caPKC? mice was not significantly different, though we observed a trend toward smaller tumors and lower tumor burden in PKC?II/dnPKC? mice. These data clearly indicate that PKC?/? plays a relatively minor role in the growth of PKC?II-initiated colon tumors. We previously demonstrated that PKC?II drives colon tumor formation by stimulating proliferation of colonic epithelial cells in vivo ( 4 ). Our current data demonstrate that PKC?II is required for AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis, and indicate that PKC?II promotes colon tumor formation by promoting tumor proliferation in a manner that is largely independent of PKC?/?. PKC?/?, on the other hand, plays a relatively minor role in tumor initiation and growth in the presence of elevated PKC?II and cannot drive tumor formation in the absence of PKC?.  PKC?/? drives the adenoma to carcinoma progression in AOM-induced colon tumors Our initial studies on PKC isozyme expression during AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis demonstrated that PKC?II expression was induced very early in the carcinogenesis process. Elevated PKC?II levels were observed in both aberrant crypt foci (ACF), early pre-neoplastic lesions in the colon, and in subsequent colon tumors ( 3 ). We also demonstrated that PKC?/? expression is elevated in AOM-induced tumors suggesting that elevated PKC?/? expression is functionally linked to colon carcinogenesis at later stages in this model ( 5 ). Consistent with this finding, transgenic caPKC? mice often develop intramucosal carcinomas rather than adenomas when treated with AOM ( 5 ). Therefore, we assessed whether PKC? plays a similar role in tumor progression in our bi-transgenic mice. Pathologic analysis of tumors from PKC?II/kdPKC? and PKC?II/caPKC? mice treated with AOM revealed that PKC?II/kdPKC? mice developed predominantly benign adenomas (7/8 tumors classified as adenoma), retaining significant tissue polarity and crypt-like structure comparable to those produced in non-transgenic mice ( Figure 2A and B ). In sharp contrast, the majority of tumors (8/11) in PKC?II/caPKC? mice contained foci exhibiting progression to malignant carcinoma (p=0.015 compared to PKC?II/kdPKC? mice). Colon carcinomas in PKC?II/caPKC? mice were characterized by the presence of disorganized sheets of epithelial tumor cells, disruption of normal crypt-like glandular architecture and loss of baso-lateral to apical cell polarity ( Figure 2C ). These data are consistent with our previous observation regarding PKC? and colon tumor progression ( 5 ).  PKC?II is dispensable for intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice PKC?II-induced intestinal epithelial cell proliferation is associated with activation of the APC/?-catenin proliferative signaling pathway and is characterized by increased GSK3? activity and stabilization of ?-catenin in the colonic epithelium in vivo ( 4 ). Our current data are consistent with the hypothesis that PKC?II promotes AOM-induced tumorigenesis by activating the APC/?-catenin proliferative signaling pathway. Transgenic PKC?II mice exhibit decreased GSK3? activity in the colonic epithelium in vivo ( 4 ), consistent with the finding that PKC?II can directly phosphorylate GSK3? at Serine 9, a phosphorylation event that inhibits GSK3? activity ( 14 ). GSK3? inhibition leads to stabilization of ?-catenin by inhibiting APC-mediated proteosomal degradation, providing a plausible mechanism by which PKC?II can stabilize ?-catenin. If ?-catenin is a critical effector of PKC?II-mediated colon tumorigenesis, one would predict that the requirement for PKC?II to promote tumorigenesis might be alleviated in mice containing an inactivating APC mutation, which serves to stabilize ?-catenin independent of GSK3?. To test this hypothesis, we crossed PKC??/? with ApcMin/+ mice to produce ApcMin/+/PKC??/? mice. As expected, ApcMin/+/PKC??/? mice exhibit undetectable levels of PKC?II mRNA in the intestinal tract as determined by QPCR, confirming the lack of PKC? expression ( Figure 3A ). In contrast, ApcMin/+ mice express abundant PKC?II mRNA in the intestine ( Figure 3A ). ApcMin/+ and ApcMin/+/PKC??/? mice exhibited no change in expression of the other PKC isozymes implicated in colon tumorigenesis, PKC?, PKC? or PKC? ( Figure 3A ). Tumor analysis revealed no change in the number of intestinal tumors between these two genotypes ( Figure 3B ). Further analysis of tumor development in the colon and the small intestine separately also revealed no change in tumor number or distribution in these organs ( Figure 3C ). Likewise, there was no significant change in tumor number or distribution within the three major regions of the small intestine, the duodenum, jejunum and ileum in these mice ( Figure 3D ). Analysis of tumor burden and average tumor size also revealed no change between these genotypes (data not shown). We conclude that PKC? is dispensable for intestinal tumorigenesis in ApcMin/+ mice. Our data are consistent with the conclusion that PKC?II promotes AOM-mediated colon carcinogenesis by stabilizing ?-catenin and driving tumor proliferation, whereas in ApcMin/+ mice, ?-catenin is stabilized by loss of APC function, thereby eliminating the need for PKC?II.  PKC?/? is important for intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice We next assessed whether PKC?/? plays a role in intestinal tumorigenesis in ApcMin/+ mice. To address this question, we generated a compound transgenic mouse line consisted of ApcMin/+ mice crossed to mice harboring a floxed PKC? allele that supports conditional, Cre recombinase-mediated inactivation of the PKC? allele (ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mice). ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mouse were then crossed to a villin-Cre mouse that expresses Cre-recombinase constitutively in the intestinal tract under the control of the tissue-specific villin promoter to produce ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin Cre mice. ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl littermates from this cross served as a negative control in these experiments. QPCR analysis of intestinal epithelium isolated from ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mice and ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin Cre mice demonstrated a significant decrease in PKC? mRNA expression in the intestinal epithelium of ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin Cre mice when compared to ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mice ( Figure 4A ). Despite the loss of PKC? expression in the intestinal tract, ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin Cre mice were viable and showed no morbidity or breeding problems. The intestinal epithelium of these mice exhibited no obvious morphological changes in crypt or villus architecture, polarity or organization ( Figure 4B ). Furthermore, the baso-lateral membrane distribution and intensity of ?-catenin in the intestine of these mice was indistinguishable from that observed in ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mice ( Figure 4C ). Thus, Cre mediated knock out of PKC? in the intestinal epithelium has no obvious detrimental consequence on intestinal epithelial tissue architecture, function or polarity. ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mice develop numerous tumors that carpet the intestinal epithelium ( Figure 5A ). However, ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin Cre mice develop significantly fewer intestinal tumors than ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl mice ( Figure 5A ). Interestingly, ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin-Cre mice exhibited a decrease in tumor number in the small intestine but not the colon ( Figure 5B ). It is unclear whether this observation reflects a differential function for PKC? in the colon and small intestine, or is due to the smaller number of colon tumors induced in the colon in this model. ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin-Cre mice developed fewer tumors in all regions of the small intestine indicating that PKC?/? is important for tumorigenesis throughout the small intestine ( Figure 5C ). Pathologic and immunohistochemical analysis of tumors from ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl and ApcMin/+/PKC?fl/fl/villin-Cre mice revealed that both genotypes produced adenomas exhibiting elevated expression and nuclear localization of ?-catenin characteristic of the ApcMin/+ phenotype ( Figure 5D ). Thus, our data demonstrate that PKC?/? plays an important role in ApcMin/+ tumorigenesis. Our results are interesting in light of the observed changes in PKC isozyme expression in AOM- and ApcMin/+-induced carcinogenesis models. We previously demonstrated that both PKC?II and PKC?/? expression is elevated during AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis, albeit with different kinetics ( 3 ). Our current study demonstrates the importance of both of these changes in driving distinct, complimentary aspects of colon tumor development. We have also observed a loss of PKC? expression in AOM-induced ACF and tumors ( 3 ), and intestinal tumors from APCmin mice exhibit changes in PKC isozyme expression similar to those observed in AOM-induced colon tumors ( 6 ). Specifically, PKC? and PKC?/? expression is elevated in intestinal tumors of ApcMin/+ mice whereas the expression of PKC? and PKC? is reduced in these tumors when compared to surrounding normal intestinal epithelium ( 6 ). Although the functional importance of the loss of PKC? expression has not yet been elucidated in the AOM model of colon carcinogenesis, PKC? loss drives tumorigenesis in the context of ApcMin/+ ( 6 ). Nullizygous PKC? (PKC??/?) mice exhibit enhanced ApcMin/+-mediated tumorigenesis, and spontaneous intestinal tumor formation in the absence of ApcMin/+, demonstrating that PKC? acts as a tumor suppressor in the intestinal tract ( 6 ). In contrast, nullizygous PKC? mice exhibited no change in susceptibility to ApcMin/+mediated tumors. Our present results demonstrate that atypical PKC? and PKC?/? play distinct, non-redundant roles in colon carcinogenesis. Whereas PKC? is dispensable for ApcMin/+ mediated tumorigenesis ( 6 ), PKC? plays a key role in both AOM-and ApcMin/+-induced carcinogenesis. These results are consistent with our findings in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) where we have shown that PKC?, but not PKC?, is specifically overexpressed in human primary NSCLC tumors and NSCLC cell lines ( 13 , 15 ). Expression of dominant negative, kdPKC? or RNAi-mediated knock down of PKC? expression, leads to inhibition of anchorage-independent growth and invasion of NSCLC cell in vitro , and loss of NSCLC cell tumorigenicity in vivo ( 13 , 15 , 16 ). In contrast, RNAi mediated knock down of PKC? has no effect on either anchorage-independent growth or invasion NSCLC cells ( 16 ). Our studies indicate that analysis of PKC isozyme expression patterns in various tumor models provides important clues to the role of specific PKC isozymes in tumorigenesis; however transgenic models such those employed here and in our previous studies ( 4 , 5 , 6 ) are essential to definitively investigate the functional role of individual PKC isozymes, and of changes in PKC isozyme expression, in physiologic and pathologic processes in vivo . Our data also demonstrate for the first time that two PKC isozymes implicated in colon carcinogenesis, PKC?II and PKC?/?, play distinct, non-redundant roles in colon tumorigenesis. Furthermore, our data provide compelling evidence that individual PKC isozymes often cannot compensate for the loss of another, highly related PKC isozyme to perform a similar function. Our results have important implications for the use of therapeutic agents targeting the PKC? and PKC?/? isozymes since drugs targeting both of these PKC isozymes are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Enzastaurin is a potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of PKC? that has shown clinical activity in glioma and B-cell lymphoma ( 17 – 19 ). Enzastaurin has also shown promise in pre-clinical xenograft models of hepatocellular carcinoma and colon carcinoma ( 20 , 21 ). Our results indicate that Enzastaurin may also be useful in colon cancer, particularly in the setting of chemoprevention. In this regard, we have found that colonic PKC?II is a relevant target of the chemopreventive activity of dietary ?-3 fatty acids ( 12 ). Enzastaurin is extremely well tolerated ( 22 , 23 ), making it a viable candidate for chemoprevention/chemo-intervention in the context of high risk colon cancer patients. However, since APC/?-catenin mutations are a prevalent event in both sporadic and familial colon cancers, PKC?-directed therapy may be most effective in very early chemoprevention strategies against colon cancer, prior to acquisition of an activating mutation in ?-catenin or loss of Apc tumor suppressor activity. In contrast, our data indicate that PKC? may be a more useful chemotherapeutic target for the treatment of advanced colon cancers that have acquired Apc/?-catenin and/or K-ras mutations. We have shown that PKC? is required for oncogenic K-ras mediated transformation both in the colon and the lung in vitro and in vivo ( 5 , 13 ). Our present data demonstrate that PKC?/? is also necessary for Apc/?-atenin mediated tumorigenesis in vivo . Since K-ras, ?-catenin and Apc mutations are observed in the majority of human colon cancers, PKC? inhibition may be an attractive strategy for treatment of these tumors. We have recently discovered a novel small molecule inhibitor of PKC?/?, aurothiomalate (ATM), that shows good anti-tumor activity non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in pre-clinical models ( 24 – 26 ). We recently demonstrated that elevated expression of PKC? in NSCLC is associated with enhanced response to PKC?-targeted therapy with ATM ( 26 ). Since PKC? expression is elevated in AOM-induced colon tumors ( 5 ), tumors in ApcMin/+ mice ( 6 ) and primary human colon tumors ( 5 ), these tumors may also be responsive to PKC?-targeted therapy. Future studies will be required to assess the efficacy of Enzastaurin and ATM in colon carcinogenesis in these models.
