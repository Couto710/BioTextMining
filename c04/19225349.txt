Ocular Toxoplasmosis Presenting With Focal Retinal Nerve Fiber Atrophy Simulating Glaucoma Purpose We describe a patient with ocular hypertension and non-glaucomatous retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) atrophy associated with an ocular toxoplasmosis retinal lesion. Patient and Method Single case report Results An RNFL defect was identified adjacent to a circumscribed pigmented chorioretinal lesion superior to the macular region. The optic disc showed a prominent central cup without focal neural rim atrophy. Red-free photography and RNFL imaging using optical coherence tomography and scanning laser polarimetry showed corresponding focal RNFL atrophy. The toxoplasmosis lesion was characterized by an apparent full thickness disruption in retinal architecture, including the retinal ganglion cell layer, using spectral-domain OCT. Conclusions Non-glaucomatous retinal lesions may simulate glaucomatous RNFL atrophy and visual field loss, particularly when focal damage to the retinal ganglion cells occurs. Careful inspection of the retina and, optic disc with attention to the integrity of the neural rim, and analysis of the pattern of RNFL loss in proximity to a retinal lesion, may enable the clinician to differentiate glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous pathogenic mechanisms.
