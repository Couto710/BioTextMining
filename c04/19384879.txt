Drug/Dye-Loaded, Multifunctional Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for Combined Targeted Cancer Therapy and Dual Optical/MR-Imaging ** A biocompatible, multimodal and theranostic functional IONPs was synthesized using a novel waterbased method and exerted excellent properties for targeted cancer therapy, optical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the first time, a facile, modified solvent diffusion method is used for the co-encapsulation of both an anti-cancer drug and near infrared dyes. The resulting folate-derivatized theranostics nanoparticles could allow for targeted optical/MR-imaging and targeted killing of folate expressing cancer cells.  Experimental Section Synthesis of PAA-IONPs (1) For the water-based, step-wise synthesis of polyacrylic acid-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (PAA-IONPs), three solutions were prepared; an iron salt solution [0.62 g of FeCl3. 6H2O and 0.32 g of FeCl2. 4H2O in dilute HCl solution (100 ?L of 12 N HCl in 2.0 mL H2O)]; an alkaline solution [1.8 mL of 30 % NH4OH solution in 15 mL of N2 purged DI water]; and a stabilizing agent solution [820 mg of polyacrylic acid in 5 mL of DI water]. To synthesize the PAA-IONP, the iron salt solution was added to the alkaline solution under vigorous stirring. The resulting dark suspension of iron oxide nanoparticles was stirred for approximately 30 seconds before addition of the stabilizing agent solution and stirred for 1 h. The resulting suspension of PAA-IONPs was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes and the supernatant was washed three times with DI water to get rid of free polyacrylic acid and other unreacted reagents using an amicon 8200 cell (Millipore ultra-filtration membrane YM – 30 k). Finally, the PAA-IONP suspension was purified using magnetic column, washed with phosphate buffer saline (pH = 7.4) and concentrated using the amicon 8200 cell system. The iron concentration and magnetic relaxation of the PAA-IONPs was determined as previously reported [Josephson et. al. Bioconjugate Chem. 1999, 10, 186–191]. The successful coating of the IONPs with PAA was confirmed by the presence of a negative zeta-potential (? = ?48 mV) and the characteristic acid carbonyl bands on the FT-IR spectroscopic analysis of the nanoparticles ( Supporting Information 1 and 5 ). Synthesis of propargylated IONPs (3): Carbodiimide chemistry To a suspension of PAA-IONP (1) (45 mg Fe) in MES buffer (26 mL, pH = 6), a solution of EDC (87 mg, 10 mmol) and NHS (52 mg, 10 mmol) in MES buffer (2 mL) was added and incubated for 3 minutes. To the resulting reaction mixture, propargyl amine (25 mg, 10 mmol) in DMF (0.5 mL) was added drop-wise and incubated for 5 h at room temperature. The resulting reaction mixture was then purified using magnetic column and then using amicon 8200 cell (Millipore ultra-filtration membrane YM – 30 k) to get rid of unreacted propargyl chloride and other unreacted reagents and kept in PBS at 4 °C. FT-IR data analysis ( Supporting Information 6 ) confirms the completion and success of the conjugation. General procedure for dye-encapsulated functional IONPs (2, 4): Modified solvent diffusion method To a suspension of IONPs (4.5 mL, [Fe] = 1.1 mg/mL) in PBS, a solution of the corresponding dialkylcarbocyanine fluorescent dyes (DiI or DiR, 0.1 ?g/?L) in DMF was added drop-wise at room temperature with continuous stirring at 1000 rpm. The resulting dye-encapsulated IONPs were purified using magnetic column and then dialyzed (using 6–8 K molecular weight cut off dialysis bag) three times against deionized water and finally against phosphate buffered saline solution. The successful encapsulation of the corresponding dye (DiI or DiR) on the PAA-IONPs was confirmed by UV/Vis spectrophotometric measurements ( Supporting Information 6a-b ). In addition, when these nanoparticles were functionalized with folate, the presence of both folate and dye encapsulated groups were assessed by UV/Vis ( Supporting Information 9a ) and fluorescence ( Supporting Information 9b ) spectrometry. Procedure for the co-encapsulation of Paclitaxel and DiI into IONPs (5) A solution containing paclitaxel (5 ?L, 0.05 ?g/?L) and DiI dye (5 ?L, 0.1 ?g/?L) in 500 ?L DMF was used and the same modified solvent diffusion method was followed as described above. The presence of taxol in the IONPs (5) was confirmed by using fluorescence spectrophotometer ( Supporting Information 10 ). Synthesis of 3a: Folate conjugation using Click chemistry To a suspension of propargylated IONPs 3 (13 mg Fe) in bicarbonate buffer (pH = 8.5), a catalytic amount of CuI (0.06 ?g, 3 × 10?10 mmol) were added for a total volume of 125 ?L of bicarbonate buffer and vortexed for 30 seconds. Then, a solution of azide-functionalized folic acid (7, Supporting Information 2 , 0.003 g, 6 × 10?2 mmol) in DMSO was added and incubated at room temperature for 12 h. The final reaction mixture was purified by using magnetic column and by dialysis using 6–8 K molecular weight cut off dialysis bag, against deionized water first and a finally with a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. The purified functional IONPs were stored at 4 °C until further use. The successful conjugation of folic acid with PAA-IONPs was confirmed by UV/Vis ( Supporting Information 7a ) and fluorescence ( Supporting Information 7b ) spectrophotometric measurements. Cell culture and cell viability studies: MTT assay The lung carcinoma cells (A549) and cardiomyocytes (H9c2) were obtained from ATCC, USA. Lung carcinomas were grown in Kaighn’s modification of Ham’s F12 medium (F12K – Cellgro), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Heat-inactivated FBS – Cellgro), L-glutamine, streptomycin, amphotericin B, and sodium bicarbonate. The cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cardiomyocyte cells were grown in Eagle’s Minimal Essential medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate, L-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, amphorericin B and sodium bicarbonate. For MTT assay, lung carcinoma and cardiomyocyte cells (2,500 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates, and were incubated with the IONPs for 3 h at 37 °C. Then, each well was washed three times with 1X PBS and treated with 20 ?L MTT (5 ?g/?l, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazo-lium bromide, Sigma-Aldrich ) for 2 h. The resulting formazan crystals were dissolved in acidified isopropanol (0.1 N HCl) and the absorbance was recoded at 570 nm and 750 nm (background), using a Synergy HT multi-detection microplate reader (Biotek). These experiments were performed in triplicates. Cellular internalization: Confocal Microscopy and IVIS experiments A Zeiss LSM 510 confocal and Zeiss Axiovert 200 epifluorescence microscopes were used to assess the uptake of folate-derivatized IONPs by the human lung carcinoma (A549) cell line. Specifically, A549 cells (10,000) were incubated with the corresponding IONPs preparation (1.1 mg/mL) for 3 h in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). Subsequently, the cells were thoroughly washed three times with 1X PBS and fixed with 10% formalin solution. Nuclear staining with DAPI was performed as recommended by the supplier. Then, multiple confocal images were obtained, achieving a representative view of the cell-IONPs interaction. For the IVIS analysis, 10,000 lung carcinoma cells were incubated for 3 h with the corresponding IONPs and the supernatant was collected in eppendorf tubes. Cells were thoroughly washed with 1X PBS and detached them, as stated above. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 1 mL culture media. All eppendorf tubes were examined simultaneously on a Xenogen IVIS system, using the ICG filter for DiR dye. All experiments were performed in triplicates. In Vitro drug/dye release The in vitro drug/dye release studies were carried out using a dynamic dialysis technique at 37 °C. Briefly, 100 ?L of IONPs (5) are incubated with a porcine liver esterase (20 ?L) inside a dialysis bag (MWCO 6000–8000), which is then placed in a PBS solution (pH 7.4). The amount of guest (dye or drug) molecules released from the nanoparticle into the PBS solution was determined at regular time intervals by taking 1-mL aliquots from the PBS solution and measuring the fluorescence intensity at 581 nm for DiI and 375 nm for Taxol. The concentration of the either dye or drug was calculated using a standard calibration curve. The cumulative fraction of release versus time was calculated using the following equation: Cumulative release ( % ) = [ guest ] t / [ guest ] total × 100 Where [guest]t is the amount of guest released at time t, [guest]total is the total guest present in the guest encapsulated IONPs.  Synthesis of PAA-IONPs (1) For the water-based, step-wise synthesis of polyacrylic acid-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (PAA-IONPs), three solutions were prepared; an iron salt solution [0.62 g of FeCl3. 6H2O and 0.32 g of FeCl2. 4H2O in dilute HCl solution (100 ?L of 12 N HCl in 2.0 mL H2O)]; an alkaline solution [1.8 mL of 30 % NH4OH solution in 15 mL of N2 purged DI water]; and a stabilizing agent solution [820 mg of polyacrylic acid in 5 mL of DI water].
