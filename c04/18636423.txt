SUPPORT NEEDS AND ACCEPTABILITY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSULTATION: ATTITUDES OF 108 WOMEN WHO HAD UNDERGONE OR WERE CONSIDERING PROPHYLACTIC MASTECTOMY Summary Prophylactic mastectomy (PM) offers 90% or greater reduction in risk of breast cancer to women at increased hereditary risk. Nonetheless, acceptance in North America has been low (0–36%). Most women report reduced cancer worry post-operatively, but up to 25–50% of women electing surgery also report psychological distress and/or difficulty adapting following PM. Psychological consultation to aid decision-making and improve post-surgical coping isn’t routinely offered. This retrospective, cross-sectional study explored, quantitatively and qualitatively, interest in and acceptability of psychological consultation for issues related to PM among 108 women who had undergone or were considering surgery. Of the 71 women who had undergone PM, more than half felt pre-surgical psychological consultation was advisable and nearly 2/3 felt post-surgical psychological consultation would be helpful. All 37 women (100%) currently considering PM believed psychological consultation would aid decision-making and preparation for surgery. Narratives from the interviews illustrate the nature and intensity of the need for psychological support and describe preferences for the role of the psychologist. Suggestions are offered for the integration of psychological services for women deciding about or adapting to PM.  INTRODUCTION Prophylactic mastectomy (PM) is one of the few evidence-based, risk-reducing options open to female carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations [ Burke 1997 ;] [ Nelson 2005 ] whose breast cancer risks are between 56% and 85% [ Ford 1994 ; Struewing 1997 ]. PM reduces breast cancer risk by 90% or more [ Hartmann 1999 ; Meijers-Heijboer 2001 ], however, acceptance and physician enthusiasm have been constrained [ Lerman 2000 ; Meiser 2000 ; Wainberg 2004 ] for this irreversible, potentially “disfiguring” [ Eisen 1999 ] option. In the U.S. and Canada, acceptance of PM has been between 0% [ Botkin 2003 ] and 36% [ Uyei 2006 ] among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Studies have shown that the majority of women undergoing PM experience reduced cancer worry post-surgery [ Frost 2000 ] [ Bresser 2006 ] [ Geiger 2006 ] and few express regret about undergoing PM. However, patient dissatisfaction focused on discontent about breast reconstruction and poor cosmetic outcomes are reported. These include problems with feminine identity, body image and sexuality after PM, in some studies affecting 25–50% of cases [ Hopwood 2000 ; [ Lodder 2002 ; van Oostrom 2003 ]. For post-PM women, social support was positively correlated with quality of life [Metcalfe 2005]. There has been limited attention in the literature to women with cancer who opt to undergo PM of their contralateral breast. A Mayo Clinic study of 583 women an average of 10 years post-contralateral PM found while over 80% of the subjects reported no change or positive effects in self-esteem, stress level, and emotional stability, many also reported adverse effects in body appearance (33%), femininity (26%), and sexual relationships (23%) [ Frost 2005 ]. Decisions about PM are often made under considerable pressure. Women with cancer often make the decision immediately following a diagnosis of breast cancer when they are under pressure to initiate treatment. Stress may be heightened for some newly-diagnosed women offered the option to undergo BRCA1/2 testing at the time of diagnosis, with the intention of providing information on their mutation status within a few weeks so that it can be used in treatment decision making, including decisions about whether to undergo prophylactic mastectomy of their unaffected breast [ Schwartz 2004 ;] [ Weitzel 2003 ]. Even women without breast disease, but with strong family histories of breast cancer, often report pressure from family members about PM. High-risk women considering PM are urged to weigh the personal pros and cons in light of their own values, worries, objective risk status, and their assessment of the potential psychological impact of surgery, but are given little guidance about how to proceed with the analysis. The pressures on women to decide about PM and reports of long-lasting, complex, post-surgical emotional distress impacting quality of life for at least a significant subset of women post-PM surgery, suggest the importance of considering the potential benefits of psychological consultation as part of pre-surgical decision-making and preparation. Patient decision-making and coping could potentially be aided by provision of a supportive, psychotherapeutic environment in which to explore both anticipated (pre-surgical) and actual (post-surgical) emotional, intrapersonal, and interpersonal effects of this impactful surgery. Some authors have suggested that psychological consultation should be “mandatory” for women who consider PM [ Josephson 2000 ] or should be provided for women who experience difficulty adjusting to PM surgery [ Lodder 2002 ]; [ Hopwood 2000 ]. While pre-surgical consultation is available in some centers [ Massie 1998 ], it is by no means a routine, integrated component of the pre- or post-surgical care of most women who undergo PM. This study explored whether women dealing with issues related to PM would be willing to accept psychological consultation and what the optimal presentation of the psychological service might be.  METHODS As part of a retrospective, largely qualitative study of psychological issues related to PM, we examined the perceived need for and acceptability of psychological consultation prior to PM and psychological services following PM surgery. Qualitative methods were utilized for the most part as they offered the best chance of understanding the complex, subjective experience and reactions of women who had undergone PM or were considering surgery [ Britten 1995 ; Huberman 1998 ]. However, several structured questions about women’s interest in psychological consultation were embedded within the larger qualitative interviews. We interviewed healthy (never had breast cancer) women who had undergone prophylactic mastectomy of both ( bilateral ) breasts ( BPM ), and women who had undergone prophylactic mastectomy of one breast ( unilateral contralateral) ( UPM) after a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer in the other breast or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We also interviewed a third group of women who were considering having PM surgery. From this latter group ( COPM-considering PM) we hoped to better understand the psychological issues faced by women during decision-making and the needs such women felt for psychological support. This report focuses on attitudes among all three groups of women towards social support in the form of psychological consultation and the women’s recommendations about the preferred nature and timing of the psychological consultation. It became clear in the course of our preliminary work that some women were aided in decision-making by discussions with other women who had previously undergone PM. Thus, we added questions about the perceived value of this type of social support which we referred to as ‘peer consultation’. Participants Women were invited to participate who met the following criteria: Had undergone unilateral or bilateral prophylactic mastectomy at one of three Boston hospitals (Brigham and Women’s, Massachusetts General or Faulkner Hospital) between 1990–2001 and were at least one year post-surgery or, Were patients in the Cancer Risk and Prevention Clinic of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute or the Breast and Ovarian Cancer Genetics Clinic at the Massachusetts General Hospital who were currently considering undergoing bilateral or unilateral prophylactic mastectomy, as indicated in their responses to clinic intake forms and/or as reported to their provider. Spoke sufficient English to complete the study interview. Women who had had breast cancer following prophylactic mastectomy were not eligible to participate in this study nor were women diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer. Procedure Participation required a.) a telephone interview conducted by a psychologist (A.F.P or S.O.) about the prophylactic mastectomy experience and b.) completion of a Demographic, Personal and Family Cancer History Questionnaire. Subjects were offered $25 for their participation. Recruitment This research was approved by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board and by the Human Subjects Research Review Board of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command. Patients who had undergone bilateral mastectomies and mastectomies in the apparent absence of a cancer diagnosis since 1990 were identified from medical records. Surgeons whose patients had been identified were contacted to verify that their patients had indeed undergone prophylactic mastectomy bilaterally or unilaterally. This was necessary because procedure codes indicating that a mastectomy was done prophylactically were not in use in the earlier part of the 12-year study period with which we were concerned and were not universally applied in later years. We also asked the surgeons’ permission to contact their patients who had undergone prophylactic mastectomies. Permission was granted by 97% of the 33 surgeons we contacted. To identify women considering PM, a medical oncologist at the Cancer Risk and Prevention Clinic at the DFCI (J.E.G.) and an oncology clinical practice genetics nurse practitioner at the MGH Breast and Ovarian Cancer Genetics Clinic (C.A.R.) were asked to identify as potential subjects women who had been seen in their respective high-risk breast/ovarian cancer clinics who had not ruled out PM and who otherwise met eligibility criteria. Potential subjects were informed about the nature of this study in a letter sent directly to them by their doctor (surgeon or oncologist) or were contacted directly by study staff when preferred by their surgeon or physician (n=3). An opt-out card was sent as well as a consent form and questionnaire. If the opt out card was not returned within 2 weeks, the subject was contacted by telephone and, if she was willing to participate, consent was administered and the interview scheduled. Assessment The questionnaire solicited information about demographic characteristics, personal (if any) and family cancer history, PM surgical history (if appropriate), and whether or not there was a known BRCA1/2 mutation in their family. Subjects who had undergone PM were asked the date and location of surgery and whether they had undergone breast reconstruction. Subjects considering PM (COPM group) were additionally asked whether they had been tested for BRCA1/2 and received a test result. Two semi-structured interview schedules were developed by the investigators for this study, one for women who had had a PM and the other for women considering PM. Questions were formulated from issues of significance observed clinically by the investigators, concerns reported in the PM outcomes literature, discussions with the surgical and oncology consultants, and topics which arose in 5 pilot interviews. The Prophylactic Mastectomy Interview for BPM and UPM subjects focused on motivation for PM, the decision-making process, communication with medical providers and relatives, surgical experience, reconstruction and physical sequelae, emotional adaptation, interpersonal and sexual impact, satisfaction/regret, and attitudes towards the potential utility and acceptability of psychological and peer consultation. The COPM Interview focused on motivations, pre-surgical decision-making, communication about PM and the perceived utility/acceptability of psychological and peer consultation. The interviews were transcribed by TechniType Inc. of San Francisco, CA. The approach utilized for coding, sorting, local and inclusive integration of the qualitative material is that of Weiss (1994) .[ Weiss 1994 ] A coding manual was devised by the investigators and used by graduate student coders to sort and organize the qualitative responses. Reliability of the coding was checked by having 5% of the interviews coded by multiple coders. Quantitative answers were tabulated to questions about potential utility and acceptability of pre and post-PM psychological consultation, cost as a barrier to services, desirable and undesirable features of psychological providers and services, and past use of psychotherapeutic services. Statistical Methods Subjects were divided into three groups for analysis: women who had undergone UPM, those having had BMP, and those considering PM (COPM). Age at PM and time since surgery were compared among BPM, UPM, and COPM groups by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Subjects’ family cancer history and use of psychological support services were examined by using the Fisher’s exact test for the three groups. All analyses were exploratory and the resulting p-values are nominal without multiple comparison adjustment.

Subjects who had undergone PM were asked the date and location of surgery and whether they had undergone breast reconstruction. Subjects considering PM (COPM group) were additionally asked whether they had been tested for BRCA1/2 and received a test result. Two semi-structured interview schedules were developed by the investigators for this study, one for women who had had a PM and the other for women considering PM. Questions were formulated from issues of significance observed clinically by the investigators, concerns reported in the PM outcomes literature, discussions with the surgical and oncology consultants, and topics which arose in 5 pilot interviews. The Prophylactic Mastectomy Interview for BPM and UPM subjects focused on motivation for PM, the decision-making process, communication with medical providers and relatives, surgical experience, reconstruction and physical sequelae, emotional adaptation, interpersonal and sexual impact, satisfaction/regret, and attitudes towards the potential utility and acceptability of psychological and peer consultation.

The approach utilized for coding, sorting, local and inclusive integration of the qualitative material is that of Weiss (1994) .[ Weiss 1994 ] A coding manual was devised by the investigators and used by graduate student coders to sort and organize the qualitative responses.

Statistical Methods Subjects were divided into three groups for analysis: women who had undergone UPM, those having had BMP, and those considering PM (COPM). Age at PM and time since surgery were compared among BPM, UPM, and COPM groups by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Subjects’ family cancer history and use of psychological support services were examined by using the Fisher’s exact test for the three groups. All analyses were exploratory and the resulting p-values are nominal without multiple comparison adjustment.  RESULTS Sample Characteristics Participation rates were 80% for the women who had undergone PM. The rate for the COPM group was 57%. We do not have any data on non-participants. The BPM group was composed of 26 women with no personal history of breast cancer who had undergone bilateral PM, mostly on the basis of extensive family history of breast cancer or diagnosis of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) (n=5). The UPM group included 45 women who identified themselves as having undergone prophylactic mastectomy in one breast following diagnosis of invasive cancer (n=36) or DCIS (n=9). The COPM group of 37 women included 1.) women with prior diagnoses of unilateral invasive breast cancer (n=13) or DCIS (n=3) who were contemplating bilateral or contralateral PM and 2.) healthy women (n=21) with significant family history of breast cancer, and/or a known or suspected BRCA mutation who were considering bilateral PM. None of the women in the BPM or UPM groups had had ovarian cancer; two of the women in the COPM group had. Five women in the BPM Group (19%) and 3 in the UPM group (7%) had previously undergone prophylactic oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries to try to prevent ovarian cancer) which is recommended for consideration by BRCA1/2 mutation carriers [ Burke 1997 ]. Eighteen of the women in the COPM group (49%) had had a prophylactic oophorectomy. Interview Length The average length of the interviews was 48 minutes (range 20–90 minutes) for the BPM group, 53 minutes for the UPM group (range 20–90 minutes), and 44 minutes for the COPM group (range 24–75 minutes). Demographics Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the 3 subject groups. Subjects were 97% Caucasian and typically well-educated with high incomes. Over 80% of subjects in all groups were married and most had children. There was no significant difference between the three groups in their educational level, income, marital status or number of children (data not shown). Women in the BPM and COPM groups were significantly younger at the time they were interviewed than were the women in the UPM group (p<0.01) (see explanation below). An unanticipated finding was that a notable proportion of subjects were employed in healthcare careers: 31% of the BPM group, 33% of UPM group, and 24% of COPM group. About half the women in the BPM group were either themselves health care professionals or had siblings or parents who were physicians. It also was noted that one-third of the women who had undergone bilateral PM had relatives who also had undertaken this surgery, some as long as 20–30 years earlier. Surgical History Women in the BPM group were an average of 4.9 years post-surgery (range 1–12 years) and their mean age at surgery was 41.8 years (range 29–59 years). In that group, 73% (n=19) had undergone reconstruction. Women in the UPM group were an average of 4.8 years post-surgery (range 2–11 years) with a mean age at surgery of 49.7 years (range 30– 83 years. Eighty percent (n=36) had elected breast reconstruction. Details of the breast reconstruction were not collected. There was no significant difference between the BPM and UPM groups in time elapsed between surgery and the interview. Healthy women undergoing bilateral PM (BPM group) were significantly younger at the time of their surgery than were women who had had invasive breast cancer or DCIS (UPM group) (p<0.01). This is likely because many in the BPM group were from families with known or likely hereditary breast cancer predisposition. Hereditary breast cancer typically occurs 1–2 decades earlier than when breast cancer occurs in women in the general population and bilateral PM for healthy at-risk women is recommended to occur 5 years below the youngest age at which breast cancer has occurred in that family. Hence, women seeking BPM for prevention of hereditary breast cancer would be likely to be younger than women diagnosed with breast cancer without such significant family history. Family Cancer History Family history of breast cancer is a major motivation for PM. Maternal death from breast cancer differed significantly among the three groups (p<0.01) with 65% in the BPM group having had a mother who died from breast cancer, as did 11% in the UPM group and 19% in the COPM group. The death of the participant’s mother from breast cancer occurred when the participant was 21 years of age or younger for 23% of the women in the BPM group, 4% of the UPM group and 5% of the COPM group (p<0.04). ( Table 2 ). The 3 groups also differed significantly in their experience of ovarian cancer among their first degree relatives (FDRs) (p<0.01). Family history of ovarian cancer was a significant feature of the family cancer history only for the COPM group. Many of the subjects in this study had had their prophylactic surgery on the basis of family history before the advent of genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility. As expected, a much higher percentage of participants in the COPM group were aware of the presence of a BRCA1/2 mutation in their families than was the case for the other 2 groups. In the BPM group, only 12% (n= 3) knew that there was a relevant mutation in their family. Twenty-three % (n=6) thought there was not a mutation in their family and most, 62% (n=16), were uncertain about BRCA1/2 status. In the UPM group, 9% (n=4) of the women said there was a known BRCA1/2 mutation in their family. The remainder appeared either not to know if there was a familial mutation (62%, n=28) or to think that a BRCA1/2 mutation had not been identified in their family (27%, n=12). One woman in each of the 2 groups who had undergone PM chose not to divulge her family’s mutation status. In the COPM group, 46% of the women (n=17) said that a specific BRCA1/2 mutation had been found in one or more of their relatives. Among the 37 women in that group, 92% (n=34) said they themselves had undergone BRCA1/2 testing and 89% (n=33) had received their test result. In the COPM group, 52% (n=19) had received a positive BRCA1/2 test result. Interest in Pre-Surgical Psychological Consultation Prior Use of Psychotherapy Because a subject’s interest in a pre-surgical psychotherapeutic consultation (defined as a session with a mental health professional) might have been influenced by the general acceptability of psychotherapy to them, we inquired about whether the women had seen a psychotherapist or counselor in any context prior to her PM decision making. Half of the women who had undergone PM and nearly ¾ of those considering PM had previously sought psychotherapeutic services. No data was collected about the nature or focus of prior psychotherapeutic services. Subjects’ Actual Use of Psychotherapeutic Consultation for PM
Decision-Making Relatively small percentages of each subject group had spoken with a psychotherapist about the PM decision. Among the BPM group, 15% (n=4) had spoken with a mental health professional about PM prior to their surgery and 50% reported that they found the consultation helpful. In both cases where the consultation was felt not to have been helpful, the surgeon had requested the consultation and it was perceived by the subject as being an evaluation of her psychological competence rather than as a source of potential help in decision-making. In the UPM group, 20% (n=9) had spoken to a therapist about their PM decision, and all had found this consultation useful. In the COPM group, 14% (n=5) had consulted a mental health professional and 80% found it useful. The women who did not said her therapist was not sufficiently knowledgeable about PM to be helpful. Advisability/Acceptability of Pre-PM Psychological Consultation The groups differed significantly in their endorsement of a pre-PM psychological consultation (p<0.01) ( Table 3 ). Among the BPM group, 54% (n=14) said they thought it would have been useful for them to have had a psychological consultation as part of their pre-surgical work-up. An additional 27% (n=7) said that it might not have been useful for them, but would be valuable for others, either their relatives or others with needs different from their own, to have that option. Fifteen percent of the BPM group (n=4) stated that they did not feel that a pre-surgical psychological consultation would be useful. Among the UPM patients, 51% (n=23) felt a pre-surgical psychological consultation would have been useful to them and an additional 24% (11) felt that it might have been useful for others, but would not have been for them. In this group, 24% (n=11) thought it would not be useful for women to be offered a pre-surgical psychological consultation. The most commonly cited reasons for feeling psychological consultation would not have been useful were that the subject had already made up her mind and thus did not need to discuss the decision, and that the availability of support from friends and family rendered professional consultation unnecessary. A few subjects also cited cultural bias towards psychotherapy as shameful and prior negative experiences with therapy as reasons it might not be helpful for them. All (100%) of the 37 COPM subjects thought it would be useful to have a psychological consultation as part of the standard pre-surgical preparation. Narratives relevant to utility of pre-surgical psychological
consultation The following quotes taken from the interviews illustrate more specifically women’s attitudes and feelings about psychological consultation. Useful “I didn’t even consider it (psychological consult). I was so hell-bent on doing the surgery. I didn’t feel like I needed to consult with anybody. It would have prepared me for feelings of loss. It would have been useful to talk with a third party openly and honestly about what your fears, worries, concerns are. Even useful for couples to talk about how this might affect your sexual self and your sexual relationship.” [38 year old woman, 8 years postbilateral PM.] Useful “I think that it (psychological consult) would have been extremely useful Because I was dealing with a lot of fear. I know you cannot see clearly. Even when you make the decision, you still have a driving force moving you forward and maybe you don’t think about the options.” [34 year old woman with a prior cancer diagnosis, 2 years post unilateral PM.] Not for me, Good for Others “No, it’s not for me. For my daughter, probably, though. No, my attitude towards the whole thing is, ‘Let’s go forward, let’s get it over with. I’m fine’. I did not need any psychological profiles.” [52-year old woman with a prior cancer diagnosis, 5 years post-unilateral PM.] Not Useful “I never considered it. I think it’s that whole stoic personality style. I don’t need that, you know. I’m just going to take a weekend and get this done. So, that’s why I didn’t consider it.” [51-year old woman, 5 years post unilateral PM] Not Useful “Maybe it wouldn’t have hurt, but I don’t know if they would have figured anything out because all these years later, it’s not like it’s anything to really figure out. There’s just a lot of pros and cons that are still there.” [50-year old woman, 12 years post-bilateral PM.] Desirable and Undesirable Aspects of a Potential Psychological
Consultation Therapist Neutrality The neutrality and independence of the psychological consultant were important factors in subjects’ views of the acceptability of such consultation. Subjects were particularly vocal about their fear that a mental health consultant seeing a patient considering PM might try to unduly exert an influence on the patient’s decision based on factors unrelated to the patient (i.e. the therapist’s views of PM). They felt early clarification of the therapist’s neutrality about the outcome of the patient’s decision would be critical. Subjects also stated that it would be important to specify that the goal of the psychological consultation was to provide an opportunity for patients to consider the emotional and interpersonal ramifications of their PM surgery, rather than as an assessment of psychological competence or suitability for surgery. Psychological Consultation as Standard Practice or by Physician/Surgeon
Referral? A related issue which surfaced in participants’ responses to the question about the advisability of a pre-surgical psychological consultation was whether the mental health consultation would be a standard or obligatory part of the pre-surgical work-up or whether it would be offered as an option. Words such as, “offended”, “resent”, or “intimidated” came up in discussion of the optimal referral format. Some said they might have resented being required to see a psychologist or other mental health consultant as part of the surgical work-up. However, most subjects felt that presenting the service in the context of the standard workup was preferable and reduced or eliminated any implication that the referral was based on the surgeon’s suspicion about instability in the patient’s general psychological state or deficiency in their decision-making ability. Standard “Because if they didn’t say it [the psychological consultation] was a standard part of it, I might be offended. If they say, ‘We’re going to send you for a blood test to make sure you’re all right, a psychologist, a urinalysis..” and the psychologist is on the list of things, then, I think you just blow it off and say, “Fine”.” [45 year old woman, 1 year postbilateral PM.] Some felt that an intervention as simple as having the mental health professional meet a patient, preferably before surgery, to offer services would be helpful, even if there were no evident problems. Therapist Knowledgeable about PM Subjects voiced the concern that to be effective, a therapist helping women deal with issues related to PM would have to be knowledgeable about the types of PM surgery and reconstruction options available and about the common complications of surgery, and to be well versed in the emotional and physical sequelae of PM surgery. It was not infrequent for the wish to be expressed that the ideal therapist would be one who had undergone PM herself. Possible Components of the Consultation Subjects were asked about three possible component parts of a psychological consultation: 1) rehearsal/anticipation of what the patient might feel after PM, 2) relaxation training, and 3) a couples session. Difficulty in correctly anticipating emotions following a stressful medical intervention has been associated with post-intervention distress [ Dorval 2000 ] [ Miller 2005 ]. Hence, the ability to consider in a therapeutic context the feelings which might occur post-surgically could help bring anticipated and actual emotions into greater synchrony and reduce post-surgical distress. Relaxation training might offer a method of reducing anxiety at the many stressful points along the PM decision continuum and post-surgically. And, because earlier work has suggested that some of the most dramatic impact of PM affects sexual relationships, a couples’ session might usefully engage both the patient and spouse/ partner in consideration of the potential impact of PM. About half of the subjects thought relaxation training and couples therapy would be useful components of a psychological intervention related to PM. Fewer thought rehearsing their feelings about PM would be useful, but it was less clear subjects understood this component. Spouse Session Desirable “I think probably there should have been more support for us as a couple, and there really wasn’t any. Like even my doctors didn’t really talk to me very much about the physical changes. No one ever talked to my husband. I think the two of us probably should have had some type of counseling.” [36 year old woman with prior cancer diagnosis, 3 years post-unilateral PM.] Spouse Session Desirable “I think if I could do one thing differently, it would have been to have ________ (husband) see someone alone. I was concerned about being there for my child and my husband and my family. But, in looking back, he definitely needed some support.” [39 year old woman with prior cancer diagnosis, 6 years post-unilateral PM for cancer.] Interest in Post-Surgical Psychological Consultation Advisability /Acceptability of Post-PM Psychological Consultation Of the women who had undergone PM, 54% (n=14) of the BPM group and 67% (n=30) of the UPM group said they thought it would be advisable for women to be offered psychological services following prophylactic mastectomy surgery. Such services were considered not necessary or not advisable by 42% of the BPM group and 25% of the UPM group. The remaining women either did not have the question posed to them correctly or did not give a clearly interpretable response. Of the COPM women, 81% (n=30) thought post-surgical services would be helpful, 14% (n=5) did not think so, and 2 women (5%) gave uninterpretable responses. Want Post-Surgery Psychological Consult “Yes, definitely. Because you go into deep depression, you really do, because you’ve just mutilated your body, you’re in total shock about what you did, and you’re undecided. Should I have done this, shouldn’t I have? Should I have waited five years to see if something else came out? A lot of doubts. So, afterwards, I’d definitely work it [psychological consultation] in.” [45 year old woman with prior cancer diagnosis, 5 years post-unilateral PM.] Need for/Timing of Post-Surgery Consultation “ Yes. But I think it would be after the fact, a couple months after, and then like a year into the plan. Because after, it’s like, before you go into it at least you know how to be prepared on how to think or how to try to work through it, but then going into it, like three months after, after you finally get the bandages off and you look and it’s like, whoa. It was like having breasts of a 37-year-old woman going down to a 16-year-old woman again. I was like, whoa. Not having the nipples there, it was kind of like, oh, my God. I can still feel that image when I think about it. But the reason I say a year is by then our body really has healed and you’ve worked through it and your arms are moving and you’re sitting up and laying and doing the things that you’re used to. That’s when I found I had the worst, because it was, like, it hit me. I just did not feel like I was a woman anymore. I felt like I was just in a woman’s body, but I wasn’t whole. I know I’m whole, but at that time you could tell me I was whole, but I’d say, “No, I’m not,” because I didn’t have breasts. But breasts is not what makes a woman.” [44 year-old woman, 7 years post bilateral PM.] No Need for Post-Surgical Consultation “I don't know. Yes. Yes, if there were issues. By then it's all over with, and there's really nothing to deal with. Like your body's getting better, but I think your emotions are healed at that point. I don't think there was any trauma afterwards to get over. At least, in my case, like I said, I was so relieved and elated that I was anxious to tell people. That was my reaction.” [39 year old woman, 2 years post-bilateral PM.] Cost a Barrier to Psychological Consultation At least 2/3 of the women in all three groups said that cost of mental health services would not be a barrier to their seeking psychological services related to PM. Many said that such services would be covered by their insurance policies. Interest in peer consultation Use of/desire for peer consultation Many women reported that they had been helped in their decision-making or preparation for surgery by speaking with another woman who had previously undergone PM. Of the women in the BPM group, 65% (n = 17) had spoken with such a peer consultant and all who did (100%) found it helpful. Fifteen percent (n = 4) had wanted to speak to a peer, but had not been able to. An additional 15% (n = 4) felt that a peer consultation would not have been useful. In the UPM group, 42% (n = 19) had spoken with a peer. An additional 7% (n = 3) of the group would have liked to have spoken with a peer. Forty-two percent (n = 19) did not think it would have been advisable to have had a peer consultation. Responses from four women (9%) were unclear in their intent or it was felt that the question had not been posed correctly. In the COPM group, 51% (n = 19) had spoken with another woman who had previously undergone PM and 84% found the consultation helpful. An additional 35% (n = 13) said that they would like the opportunity to speak with such a peer. Five women (14%) did not feel such a consultation would be useful to them. Value of peer consultation: ‘I think it would have been very helpful for me to find another human being who was going through this, because, again, to me there was so much of the feeling of I’m outside the realm of normal life. And to normalize this experience by connecting you with others, I think, would be incredibly valuable’ [38-year-old woman, 8 years post-BPM.] Value of peer consultation: ‘I think most questions are about what it’s like and because it’s so unknown and so scary a thing to imagine, that unless you’ve talked to someone that’s [sic] been through it, you can’t get those things answered. I think there’s a lot of comfort by hearing someone who has actually felt the pain, gone through it, seen it, done it that can really help more than almost anything else could help. . .’ [45-year-old woman, 9 years post-BPM.] Value of peer consultation: ‘Then he put me in touch with a young girl who had it at a very young age, and I talked to her on the phone for maybe two hours. She was so positive and so upbeat and went on to have, I think she ended up having three kids afterwards. She told me about her husband’s reaction and everything. She was very much an inspiration in my feeling good about my decision. Probably talking to that young girl, that young woman, who was so positive about it and had gone through it. That probably was the thing that relieved me.’ [39-year-old woman, 2 years post-BPM.] Would not value peer consultation: [Want to talk to other PM?] ‘No, I don’t think it probably would have made any difference. I’m kind of an independent cuss. No, not really, not with me being the way I am. Like I say, I can see where some people, like my cousin, it was really helpful to her to have somebody to talk to that [sic] had been through that, and I know with patients and stuff, that some people are like that. But with me, I don’t think it would have made any difference.’ [49-year-old woman, 3 years post-BPM.] Matching important While there appeared to be value in talking to a woman who had been through surgery for the majority of women who had had that opportunity, the communication appeared most helpful when the two women shared demographic and/or surgical characteristics in common. When the peer was of similar age or marital status to the woman seeking the consultation, it was felt to be most useful. Also, when the peer had had the same type of reconstruction as that sought by the subject, it was most helpful. There was some discontent voiced when such matchings were not present. Matching important: ‘I think the most helpful thing psychologically is for a woman to speak to somebody else who’s done it and tells you, guess what, there’s life at the end of this. You’re going to grow into your new boobs, and you’re going to forget that you’ve got them. Hearing women who have been through it, and women who specifically want to address my issues as a single woman, I think that’s really important, because I was fortunate enough to speak to someone who said, ‘Are you married?’ I said, ‘No’. She said, ‘Listen, I can’t speak, because I was married when I did it. But this is my feeling of what it would be like for you as a single woman.’ So I think it would be nice for him [the surgeon] to have somebody on the list that would have been a match for me at that point, being single.’ [45-year-old woman, 1 year post-BPM.]  RESULTS Sample Characteristics Participation rates were 80% for the women who had undergone PM. The rate for the COPM group was 57%. We do not have any data on non-participants. The BPM group was composed of 26 women with no personal history of breast cancer who had undergone bilateral PM, mostly on the basis of extensive family history of breast cancer or diagnosis of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) (n=5). The UPM group included 45 women who identified themselves as having undergone prophylactic mastectomy in one breast following diagnosis of invasive cancer (n=36) or DCIS (n=9). The COPM group of 37 women included 1.) women with prior diagnoses of unilateral invasive breast cancer (n=13) or DCIS (n=3) who were contemplating bilateral or contralateral PM and 2.) healthy women (n=21) with significant family history of breast cancer, and/or a known or suspected BRCA mutation who were considering bilateral PM. None of the women in the BPM or UPM groups had had ovarian cancer; two of the women in the COPM group had. Five women in the BPM Group (19%) and 3 in the UPM group (7%) had previously undergone prophylactic oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries to try to prevent ovarian cancer) which is recommended for consideration by BRCA1/2 mutation carriers [ Burke 1997 ]. Eighteen of the women in the COPM group (49%) had had a prophylactic oophorectomy. Interview Length The average length of the interviews was 48 minutes (range 20–90 minutes) for the BPM group, 53 minutes for the UPM group (range 20–90 minutes), and 44 minutes for the COPM group (range 24–75 minutes). Demographics Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the 3 subject groups. Subjects were 97% Caucasian and typically well-educated with high incomes. Over 80% of subjects in all groups were married and most had children. There was no significant difference between the three groups in their educational level, income, marital status or number of children (data not shown). Women in the BPM and COPM groups were significantly younger at the time they were interviewed than were the women in the UPM group (p<0.01) (see explanation below). An unanticipated finding was that a notable proportion of subjects were employed in healthcare careers: 31% of the BPM group, 33% of UPM group, and 24% of COPM group. About half the women in the BPM group were either themselves health care professionals or had siblings or parents who were physicians. It also was noted that one-third of the women who had undergone bilateral PM had relatives who also had undertaken this surgery, some as long as 20–30 years earlier. Surgical History Women in the BPM group were an average of 4.9 years post-surgery (range 1–12 years) and their mean age at surgery was 41.8 years (range 29–59 years). In that group, 73% (n=19) had undergone reconstruction. Women in the UPM group were an average of 4.8 years post-surgery (range 2–11 years) with a mean age at surgery of 49.7 years (range 30– 83 years. Eighty percent (n=36) had elected breast reconstruction. Details of the breast reconstruction were not collected. There was no significant difference between the BPM and UPM groups in time elapsed between surgery and the interview. Healthy women undergoing bilateral PM (BPM group) were significantly younger at the time of their surgery than were women who had had invasive breast cancer or DCIS (UPM group) (p<0.01). This is likely because many in the BPM group were from families with known or likely hereditary breast cancer predisposition. Hereditary breast cancer typically occurs 1–2 decades earlier than when breast cancer occurs in women in the general population and bilateral PM for healthy at-risk women is recommended to occur 5 years below the youngest age at which breast cancer has occurred in that family. Hence, women seeking BPM for prevention of hereditary breast cancer would be likely to be younger than women diagnosed with breast cancer without such significant family history. Family Cancer History Family history of breast cancer is a major motivation for PM. Maternal death from breast cancer differed significantly among the three groups (p<0.01) with 65% in the BPM group having had a mother who died from breast cancer, as did 11% in the UPM group and 19% in the COPM group. The death of the participant’s mother from breast cancer occurred when the participant was 21 years of age or younger for 23% of the women in the BPM group, 4% of the UPM group and 5% of the COPM group (p<0.04). ( Table 2 ). The 3 groups also differed significantly in their experience of ovarian cancer among their first degree relatives (FDRs) (p<0.01). Family history of ovarian cancer was a significant feature of the family cancer history only for the COPM group. Many of the subjects in this study had had their prophylactic surgery on the basis of family history before the advent of genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility. As expected, a much higher percentage of participants in the COPM group were aware of the presence of a BRCA1/2 mutation in their families than was the case for the other 2 groups. In the BPM group, only 12% (n= 3) knew that there was a relevant mutation in their family. Twenty-three % (n=6) thought there was not a mutation in their family and most, 62% (n=16), were uncertain about BRCA1/2 status. In the UPM group, 9% (n=4) of the women said there was a known BRCA1/2 mutation in their family. The remainder appeared either not to know if there was a familial mutation (62%, n=28) or to think that a BRCA1/2 mutation had not been identified in their family (27%, n=12). One woman in each of the 2 groups who had undergone PM chose not to divulge her family’s mutation status. In the COPM group, 46% of the women (n=17) said that a specific BRCA1/2 mutation had been found in one or more of their relatives. Among the 37 women in that group, 92% (n=34) said they themselves had undergone BRCA1/2 testing and 89% (n=33) had received their test result. In the COPM group, 52% (n=19) had received a positive BRCA1/2 test result. Interest in Pre-Surgical Psychological Consultation Prior Use of Psychotherapy Because a subject’s interest in a pre-surgical psychotherapeutic consultation (defined as a session with a mental health professional) might have been influenced by the general acceptability of psychotherapy to them, we inquired about whether the women had seen a psychotherapist or counselor in any context prior to her PM decision making. Half of the women who had undergone PM and nearly ¾ of those considering PM had previously sought psychotherapeutic services. No data was collected about the nature or focus of prior psychotherapeutic services. Subjects’ Actual Use of Psychotherapeutic Consultation for PM
Decision-Making Relatively small percentages of each subject group had spoken with a psychotherapist about the PM decision. Among the BPM group, 15% (n=4) had spoken with a mental health professional about PM prior to their surgery and 50% reported that they found the consultation helpful. In both cases where the consultation was felt not to have been helpful, the surgeon had requested the consultation and it was perceived by the subject as being an evaluation of her psychological competence rather than as a source of potential help in decision-making. In the UPM group, 20% (n=9) had spoken to a therapist about their PM decision, and all had found this consultation useful. In the COPM group, 14% (n=5) had consulted a mental health professional and 80% found it useful. The women who did not said her therapist was not sufficiently knowledgeable about PM to be helpful. Advisability/Acceptability of Pre-PM Psychological Consultation The groups differed significantly in their endorsement of a pre-PM psychological consultation (p<0.01) ( Table 3 ). Among the BPM group, 54% (n=14) said they thought it would have been useful for them to have had a psychological consultation as part of their pre-surgical work-up. An additional 27% (n=7) said that it might not have been useful for them, but would be valuable for others, either their relatives or others with needs different from their own, to have that option. Fifteen percent of the BPM group (n=4) stated that they did not feel that a pre-surgical psychological consultation would be useful. Among the UPM patients, 51% (n=23) felt a pre-surgical psychological consultation would have been useful to them and an additional 24% (11) felt that it might have been useful for others, but would not have been for them. In this group, 24% (n=11) thought it would not be useful for women to be offered a pre-surgical psychological consultation. The most commonly cited reasons for feeling psychological consultation would not have been useful were that the subject had already made up her mind and thus did not need to discuss the decision, and that the availability of support from friends and family rendered professional consultation unnecessary. A few subjects also cited cultural bias towards psychotherapy as shameful and prior negative experiences with therapy as reasons it might not be helpful for them. All (100%) of the 37 COPM subjects thought it would be useful to have a psychological consultation as part of the standard pre-surgical preparation. Narratives relevant to utility of pre-surgical psychological
consultation The following quotes taken from the interviews illustrate more specifically women’s attitudes and feelings about psychological consultation. Useful “I didn’t even consider it (psychological consult). I was so hell-bent on doing the surgery. I didn’t feel like I needed to consult with anybody. It would have prepared me for feelings of loss. It would have been useful to talk with a third party openly and honestly about what your fears, worries, concerns are. Even useful for couples to talk about how this might affect your sexual self and your sexual relationship.” [38 year old woman, 8 years postbilateral PM.] Useful “I think that it (psychological consult) would have been extremely useful Because I was dealing with a lot of fear. I know you cannot see clearly. Even when you make the decision, you still have a driving force moving you forward and maybe you don’t think about the options.” [34 year old woman with a prior cancer diagnosis, 2 years post unilateral PM.] Not for me, Good for Others “No, it’s not for me. For my daughter, probably, though. No, my attitude towards the whole thing is, ‘Let’s go forward, let’s get it over with. I’m fine’. I did not need any psychological profiles.” [52-year old woman with a prior cancer diagnosis, 5 years post-unilateral PM.] Not Useful “I never considered it. I think it’s that whole stoic personality style. I don’t need that, you know. I’m just going to take a weekend and get this done. So, that’s why I didn’t consider it.” [51-year old woman, 5 years post unilateral PM] Not Useful “Maybe it wouldn’t have hurt, but I don’t know if they would have figured anything out because all these years later, it’s not like it’s anything to really figure out. There’s just a lot of pros and cons that are still there.” [50-year old woman, 12 years post-bilateral PM.] Desirable and Undesirable Aspects of a Potential Psychological
Consultation Therapist Neutrality The neutrality and independence of the psychological consultant were important factors in subjects’ views of the acceptability of such consultation. Subjects were particularly vocal about their fear that a mental health consultant seeing a patient considering PM might try to unduly exert an influence on the patient’s decision based on factors unrelated to the patient (i.e. the therapist’s views of PM). They felt early clarification of the therapist’s neutrality about the outcome of the patient’s decision would be critical. Subjects also stated that it would be important to specify that the goal of the psychological consultation was to provide an opportunity for patients to consider the emotional and interpersonal ramifications of their PM surgery, rather than as an assessment of psychological competence or suitability for surgery. Psychological Consultation as Standard Practice or by Physician/Surgeon
Referral? A related issue which surfaced in participants’ responses to the question about the advisability of a pre-surgical psychological consultation was whether the mental health consultation would be a standard or obligatory part of the pre-surgical work-up or whether it would be offered as an option. Words such as, “offended”, “resent”, or “intimidated” came up in discussion of the optimal referral format. Some said they might have resented being required to see a psychologist or other mental health consultant as part of the surgical work-up. However, most subjects felt that presenting the service in the context of the standard workup was preferable and reduced or eliminated any implication that the referral was based on the surgeon’s suspicion about instability in the patient’s general psychological state or deficiency in their decision-making ability. Standard “Because if they didn’t say it [the psychological consultation] was a standard part of it, I might be offended. If they say, ‘We’re going to send you for a blood test to make sure you’re all right, a psychologist, a urinalysis..” and the psychologist is on the list of things, then, I think you just blow it off and say, “Fine”.” [45 year old woman, 1 year postbilateral PM.] Some felt that an intervention as simple as having the mental health professional meet a patient, preferably before surgery, to offer services would be helpful, even if there were no evident problems. Therapist Knowledgeable about PM Subjects voiced the concern that to be effective, a therapist helping women deal with issues related to PM would have to be knowledgeable about the types of PM surgery and reconstruction options available and about the common complications of surgery, and to be well versed in the emotional and physical sequelae of PM surgery. It was not infrequent for the wish to be expressed that the ideal therapist would be one who had undergone PM herself. Possible Components of the Consultation Subjects were asked about three possible component parts of a psychological consultation: 1) rehearsal/anticipation of what the patient might feel after PM, 2) relaxation training, and 3) a couples session. Difficulty in correctly anticipating emotions following a stressful medical intervention has been associated with post-intervention distress [ Dorval 2000 ] [ Miller 2005 ]. Hence, the ability to consider in a therapeutic context the feelings which might occur post-surgically could help bring anticipated and actual emotions into greater synchrony and reduce post-surgical distress. Relaxation training might offer a method of reducing anxiety at the many stressful points along the PM decision continuum and post-surgically. And, because earlier work has suggested that some of the most dramatic impact of PM affects sexual relationships, a couples’ session might usefully engage both the patient and spouse/ partner in consideration of the potential impact of PM. About half of the subjects thought relaxation training and couples therapy would be useful components of a psychological intervention related to PM. Fewer thought rehearsing their feelings about PM would be useful, but it was less clear subjects understood this component. Spouse Session Desirable “I think probably there should have been more support for us as a couple, and there really wasn’t any. Like even my doctors didn’t really talk to me very much about the physical changes. No one ever talked to my husband. I think the two of us probably should have had some type of counseling.” [36 year old woman with prior cancer diagnosis, 3 years post-unilateral PM.] Spouse Session Desirable “I think if I could do one thing differently, it would have been to have ________ (husband) see someone alone. I was concerned about being there for my child and my husband and my family. But, in looking back, he definitely needed some support.” [39 year old woman with prior cancer diagnosis, 6 years post-unilateral PM for cancer.] Interest in Post-Surgical Psychological Consultation Advisability /Acceptability of Post-PM Psychological Consultation Of the women who had undergone PM, 54% (n=14) of the BPM group and 67% (n=30) of the UPM group said they thought it would be advisable for women to be offered psychological services following prophylactic mastectomy surgery. Such services were considered not necessary or not advisable by 42% of the BPM group and 25% of the UPM group. The remaining women either did not have the question posed to them correctly or did not give a clearly interpretable response. Of the COPM women, 81% (n=30) thought post-surgical services would be helpful, 14% (n=5) did not think so, and 2 women (5%) gave uninterpretable responses. Want Post-Surgery Psychological Consult “Yes, definitely. Because you go into deep depression, you really do, because you’ve just mutilated your body, you’re in total shock about what you did, and you’re undecided. Should I have done this, shouldn’t I have? Should I have waited five years to see if something else came out? A lot of doubts. So, afterwards, I’d definitely work it [psychological consultation] in.” [45 year old woman with prior cancer diagnosis, 5 years post-unilateral PM.] Need for/Timing of Post-Surgery Consultation “ Yes.

I know I’m whole, but at that time you could tell me I was whole, but I’d say, “No, I’m not,” because I didn’t have breasts. But breasts is not what makes a woman.” [44 year-old woman, 7 years post bilateral PM.] No Need for Post-Surgical Consultation “I don't know. Yes. Yes, if there were issues. By then it's all over with, and there's really nothing to deal with. Like your body's getting better, but I think your emotions are healed at that point. I don't think there was any trauma afterwards to get over. At least, in my case, like I said, I was so relieved and elated that I was anxious to tell people. That was my reaction.” [39 year old woman, 2 years post-bilateral PM.] Cost a Barrier to Psychological Consultation At least 2/3 of the women in all three groups said that cost of mental health services would not be a barrier to their seeking psychological services related to PM. Many said that such services would be covered by their insurance policies. Interest in peer consultation Use of/desire for peer consultation Many women reported that they had been helped in their decision-making or preparation for surgery by speaking with another woman who had previously undergone PM. Of the women in the BPM group, 65% (n = 17) had spoken with such a peer consultant and all who did (100%) found it helpful. Fifteen percent (n = 4) had wanted to speak to a peer, but had not been able to. An additional 15% (n = 4) felt that a peer consultation would not have been useful. In the UPM group, 42% (n = 19) had spoken with a peer. An additional 7% (n = 3) of the group would have liked to have spoken with a peer. Forty-two percent (n = 19) did not think it would have been advisable to have had a peer consultation. Responses from four women (9%) were unclear in their intent or it was felt that the question had not been posed correctly. In the COPM group, 51% (n = 19) had spoken with another woman who had previously undergone PM and 84% found the consultation helpful. An additional 35% (n = 13) said that they would like the opportunity to speak with such a peer. Five women (14%) did not feel such a consultation would be useful to them. Value of peer consultation: ‘I think it would have been very helpful for me to find another human being who was going through this, because, again, to me there was so much of the feeling of I’m outside the realm of normal life.

Five women in the BPM Group (19%) and 3 in the UPM group (7%) had previously undergone prophylactic oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries to try to prevent ovarian cancer) which is recommended for consideration by BRCA1/2 mutation carriers [ Burke 1997 ]. Eighteen of the women in the COPM group (49%) had had a prophylactic oophorectomy.  Interview Length The average length of the interviews was 48 minutes (range 20–90 minutes) for the BPM group, 53 minutes for the UPM group (range 20–90 minutes), and 44 minutes for the COPM group (range 24–75 minutes).  Interview Length The average length of the interviews was 48 minutes (range 20–90 minutes) for the BPM group, 53 minutes for the UPM group (range 20–90 minutes), and 44 minutes for the COPM group (range 24–75 minutes).  Demographics Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the 3 subject groups. Subjects were 97% Caucasian and typically well-educated with high incomes. Over 80% of subjects in all groups were married and most had children. There was no significant difference between the three groups in their educational level, income, marital status or number of children (data not shown). Women in the BPM and COPM groups were significantly younger at the time they were interviewed than were the women in the UPM group (p<0.01) (see explanation below). An unanticipated finding was that a notable proportion of subjects were employed in healthcare careers: 31% of the BPM group, 33% of UPM group, and 24% of COPM group. About half the women in the BPM group were either themselves health care professionals or had siblings or parents who were physicians. It also was noted that one-third of the women who had undergone bilateral PM had relatives who also had undertaken this surgery, some as long as 20–30 years earlier.

It also was noted that one-third of the women who had undergone bilateral PM had relatives who also had undertaken this surgery, some as long as 20–30 years earlier.  Surgical History Women in the BPM group were an average of 4.9 years post-surgery (range 1–12 years) and their mean age at surgery was 41.8 years (range 29–59 years). In that group, 73% (n=19) had undergone reconstruction. Women in the UPM group were an average of 4.8 years post-surgery (range 2–11 years) with a mean age at surgery of 49.7 years (range 30– 83 years. Eighty percent (n=36) had elected breast reconstruction. Details of the breast reconstruction were not collected. There was no significant difference between the BPM and UPM groups in time elapsed between surgery and the interview. Healthy women undergoing bilateral PM (BPM group) were significantly younger at the time of their surgery than were women who had had invasive breast cancer or DCIS (UPM group) (p<0.01). This is likely because many in the BPM group were from families with known or likely hereditary breast cancer predisposition. Hereditary breast cancer typically occurs 1–2 decades earlier than when breast cancer occurs in women in the general population and bilateral PM for healthy at-risk women is recommended to occur 5 years below the youngest age at which breast cancer has occurred in that family. Hence, women seeking BPM for prevention of hereditary breast cancer would be likely to be younger than women diagnosed with breast cancer without such significant family history.

Hence, women seeking BPM for prevention of hereditary breast cancer would be likely to be younger than women diagnosed with breast cancer without such significant family history.  Family Cancer History Family history of breast cancer is a major motivation for PM. Maternal death from breast cancer differed significantly among the three groups (p<0.01) with 65% in the BPM group having had a mother who died from breast cancer, as did 11% in the UPM group and 19% in the COPM group. The death of the participant’s mother from breast cancer occurred when the participant was 21 years of age or younger for 23% of the women in the BPM group, 4% of the UPM group and 5% of the COPM group (p<0.04). ( Table 2 ). The 3 groups also differed significantly in their experience of ovarian cancer among their first degree relatives (FDRs) (p<0.01). Family history of ovarian cancer was a significant feature of the family cancer history only for the COPM group. Many of the subjects in this study had had their prophylactic surgery on the basis of family history before the advent of genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility. As expected, a much higher percentage of participants in the COPM group were aware of the presence of a BRCA1/2 mutation in their families than was the case for the other 2 groups. In the BPM group, only 12% (n= 3) knew that there was a relevant mutation in their family. Twenty-three % (n=6) thought there was not a mutation in their family and most, 62% (n=16), were uncertain about BRCA1/2 status. In the UPM group, 9% (n=4) of the women said there was a known BRCA1/2 mutation in their family. The remainder appeared either not to know if there was a familial mutation (62%, n=28) or to think that a BRCA1/2 mutation had not been identified in their family (27%, n=12). One woman in each of the 2 groups who had undergone PM chose not to divulge her family’s mutation status. In the COPM group, 46% of the women (n=17) said that a specific BRCA1/2 mutation had been found in one or more of their relatives. Among the 37 women in that group, 92% (n=34) said they themselves had undergone BRCA1/2 testing and 89% (n=33) had received their test result. In the COPM group, 52% (n=19) had received a positive BRCA1/2 test result.  Family Cancer History Family history of breast cancer is a major motivation for PM.

Interest in Pre-Surgical Psychological Consultation Prior Use of Psychotherapy Because a subject’s interest in a pre-surgical psychotherapeutic consultation (defined as a session with a mental health professional) might have been influenced by the general acceptability of psychotherapy to them, we inquired about whether the women had seen a psychotherapist or counselor in any context prior to her PM decision making. Half of the women who had undergone PM and nearly ¾ of those considering PM had previously sought psychotherapeutic services. No data was collected about the nature or focus of prior psychotherapeutic services.

Decision-Making Relatively small percentages of each subject group had spoken with a psychotherapist about the PM decision. Among the BPM group, 15% (n=4) had spoken with a mental health professional about PM prior to their surgery and 50% reported that they found the consultation helpful. In both cases where the consultation was felt not to have been helpful, the surgeon had requested the consultation and it was perceived by the subject as being an evaluation of her psychological competence rather than as a source of potential help in decision-making. In the UPM group, 20% (n=9) had spoken to a therapist about their PM decision, and all had found this consultation useful. In the COPM group, 14% (n=5) had consulted a mental health professional and 80% found it useful. The women who did not said her therapist was not sufficiently knowledgeable about PM to be helpful. Advisability/Acceptability of Pre-PM Psychological Consultation The groups differed significantly in their endorsement of a pre-PM psychological consultation (p<0.01) ( Table 3 ). Among the BPM group, 54% (n=14) said they thought it would have been useful for them to have had a psychological consultation as part of their pre-surgical work-up. An additional 27% (n=7) said that it might not have been useful for them, but would be valuable for others, either their relatives or others with needs different from their own, to have that option. Fifteen percent of the BPM group (n=4) stated that they did not feel that a pre-surgical psychological consultation would be useful. Among the UPM patients, 51% (n=23) felt a pre-surgical psychological consultation would have been useful to them and an additional 24% (11) felt that it might have been useful for others, but would not have been for them. In this group, 24% (n=11) thought it would not be useful for women to be offered a pre-surgical psychological consultation. The most commonly cited reasons for feeling psychological consultation would not have been useful were that the subject had already made up her mind and thus did not need to discuss the decision, and that the availability of support from friends and family rendered professional consultation unnecessary. A few subjects also cited cultural bias towards psychotherapy as shameful and prior negative experiences with therapy as reasons it might not be helpful for them. All (100%) of the 37 COPM subjects thought it would be useful to have a psychological consultation as part of the standard pre-surgical preparation. Narratives relevant to utility of pre-surgical psychological
consultation The following quotes taken from the interviews illustrate more specifically women’s attitudes and feelings about psychological consultation. Useful “I didn’t even consider it (psychological consult). I was so hell-bent on doing the surgery. I didn’t feel like I needed to consult with anybody. It would have prepared me for feelings of loss. It would have been useful to talk with a third party openly and honestly about what your fears, worries, concerns are. Even useful for couples to talk about how this might affect your sexual self and your sexual relationship.” [38 year old woman, 8 years postbilateral PM.] Useful “I think that it (psychological consult) would have been extremely useful Because I was dealing with a lot of fear. I know you cannot see clearly. Even when you make the decision, you still have a driving force moving you forward and maybe you don’t think about the options.” [34 year old woman with a prior cancer diagnosis, 2 years post unilateral PM.] Not for me, Good for Others “No, it’s not for me. For my daughter, probably, though. No, my attitude towards the whole thing is, ‘Let’s go forward, let’s get it over with. I’m fine’. I did not need any psychological profiles.” [52-year old woman with a prior cancer diagnosis, 5 years post-unilateral PM.] Not Useful “I never considered it. I think it’s that whole stoic personality style. I don’t need that, you know. I’m just going to take a weekend and get this done. So, that’s why I didn’t consider it.” [51-year old woman, 5 years post unilateral PM] Not Useful “Maybe it wouldn’t have hurt, but I don’t know if they would have figured anything out because all these years later, it’s not like it’s anything to really figure out. There’s just a lot of pros and cons that are still there.” [50-year old woman, 12 years post-bilateral PM.]  Subjects’ Actual Use of Psychotherapeutic Consultation for PM

Consultation Therapist Neutrality The neutrality and independence of the psychological consultant were important factors in subjects’ views of the acceptability of such consultation. Subjects were particularly vocal about their fear that a mental health consultant seeing a patient considering PM might try to unduly exert an influence on the patient’s decision based on factors unrelated to the patient (i.e. the therapist’s views of PM). They felt early clarification of the therapist’s neutrality about the outcome of the patient’s decision would be critical. Subjects also stated that it would be important to specify that the goal of the psychological consultation was to provide an opportunity for patients to consider the emotional and interpersonal ramifications of their PM surgery, rather than as an assessment of psychological competence or suitability for surgery. Psychological Consultation as Standard Practice or by Physician/Surgeon
Referral? A related issue which surfaced in participants’ responses to the question about the advisability of a pre-surgical psychological consultation was whether the mental health consultation would be a standard or obligatory part of the pre-surgical work-up or whether it would be offered as an option. Words such as, “offended”, “resent”, or “intimidated” came up in discussion of the optimal referral format. Some said they might have resented being required to see a psychologist or other mental health consultant as part of the surgical work-up. However, most subjects felt that presenting the service in the context of the standard workup was preferable and reduced or eliminated any implication that the referral was based on the surgeon’s suspicion about instability in the patient’s general psychological state or deficiency in their decision-making ability. Standard “Because if they didn’t say it [the psychological consultation] was a standard part of it, I might be offended. If they say, ‘We’re going to send you for a blood test to make sure you’re all right, a psychologist, a urinalysis..” and the psychologist is on the list of things, then, I think you just blow it off and say, “Fine”.” [45 year old woman, 1 year postbilateral PM.] Some felt that an intervention as simple as having the mental health professional meet a patient, preferably before surgery, to offer services would be helpful, even if there were no evident problems. Therapist Knowledgeable about PM Subjects voiced the concern that to be effective, a therapist helping women deal with issues related to PM would have to be knowledgeable about the types of PM surgery and reconstruction options available and about the common complications of surgery, and to be well versed in the emotional and physical sequelae of PM surgery. It was not infrequent for the wish to be expressed that the ideal therapist would be one who had undergone PM herself.  Desirable and Undesirable Aspects of a Potential Psychological
Consultation Therapist Neutrality The neutrality and independence of the psychological consultant were important factors in subjects’ views of the acceptability of such consultation. Subjects were particularly vocal about their fear that a mental health consultant seeing a patient considering PM might try to unduly exert an influence on the patient’s decision based on factors unrelated to the patient (i.e. the therapist’s views of PM). They felt early clarification of the therapist’s neutrality about the outcome of the patient’s decision would be critical. Subjects also stated that it would be important to specify that the goal of the psychological consultation was to provide an opportunity for patients to consider the emotional and interpersonal ramifications of their PM surgery, rather than as an assessment of psychological competence or suitability for surgery. Psychological Consultation as Standard Practice or by Physician/Surgeon
Referral? A related issue which surfaced in participants’ responses to the question about the advisability of a pre-surgical psychological consultation was whether the mental health consultation would be a standard or obligatory part of the pre-surgical work-up or whether it would be offered as an option. Words such as, “offended”, “resent”, or “intimidated” came up in discussion of the optimal referral format. Some said they might have resented being required to see a psychologist or other mental health consultant as part of the surgical work-up.

It was not infrequent for the wish to be expressed that the ideal therapist would be one who had undergone PM herself.  Possible Components of the Consultation Subjects were asked about three possible component parts of a psychological consultation: 1) rehearsal/anticipation of what the patient might feel after PM, 2) relaxation training, and 3) a couples session. Difficulty in correctly anticipating emotions following a stressful medical intervention has been associated with post-intervention distress [ Dorval 2000 ] [ Miller 2005 ]. Hence, the ability to consider in a therapeutic context the feelings which might occur post-surgically could help bring anticipated and actual emotions into greater synchrony and reduce post-surgical distress. Relaxation training might offer a method of reducing anxiety at the many stressful points along the PM decision continuum and post-surgically. And, because earlier work has suggested that some of the most dramatic impact of PM affects sexual relationships, a couples’ session might usefully engage both the patient and spouse/ partner in consideration of the potential impact of PM. About half of the subjects thought relaxation training and couples therapy would be useful components of a psychological intervention related to PM. Fewer thought rehearsing their feelings about PM would be useful, but it was less clear subjects understood this component. Spouse Session Desirable “I think probably there should have been more support for us as a couple, and there really wasn’t any. Like even my doctors didn’t really talk to me very much about the physical changes. No one ever talked to my husband. I think the two of us probably should have had some type of counseling.” [36 year old woman with prior cancer diagnosis, 3 years post-unilateral PM.] Spouse Session Desirable “I think if I could do one thing differently, it would have been to have ________ (husband) see someone alone. I was concerned about being there for my child and my husband and my family. But, in looking back, he definitely needed some support.” [39 year old woman with prior cancer diagnosis, 6 years post-unilateral PM for cancer.]  Possible Components of the Consultation Subjects were asked about three possible component parts of a psychological consultation: 1) rehearsal/anticipation of what the patient might feel after PM, 2) relaxation training, and 3) a couples session.

Such services were considered not necessary or not advisable by 42% of the BPM group and 25% of the UPM group.

It was like having breasts of a 37-year-old woman going down to a 16-year-old woman again. I was like, whoa. Not having the nipples there, it was kind of like, oh, my God.

But the reason I say a year is by then our body really has healed and you’ve worked through it and your arms are moving and you’re sitting up and laying and doing the things that you’re used to.

(1997) has commented that genetic counseling and testing will result in there being, “many persons who will not suffer from a psychiatric disorder per se, but who face a complex problem that leads to a variety of thoughts, feelings and behaviors that need to be understood in the context of the person’s history. Such persons may benefit from psychological aspects being taken into consideration.” Our results showing high levels of endorsement for the provision of or, at minimum, the ready availability of psychological consultation before and after prophylactic mastectomy suggests the heavy emotional burden of decision-making regarding PM and the significant emotional impact following surgery. Of note is that reported interest in psychological consultation was similar for women who had undergone PM after diagnosis with breast cancer or DCIS and for healthy women who elected bilateral PM because of family cancer history or diagnosis of LCIS. The fact that 100% of the women in our COPM group thought a psychological consultation as a standard part of pre-surgical consultation would be advisable implies that they were finding decision-making for PM burdensome. The stress of confronting decisions raised by genetic testing and focusing on the implication of hereditary cancer has been described by others [ Hamann 2005 ]; [ Stiefel 1997 ]. Our findings speak specifically to the need for and acceptability of psychological services to help women considering PM by providing an opportunity to evaluate the potential emotional and inter-personal impact. Our findings provide a different perspective than studies which report the benefits of prophylactic mastectomy solely in terms of reduced cancer worry and lack of regret. Lack of regret about having had PM should not be assumed to imply that women considering or undergoing PM do not encounter considerable emotional upheaval and intra- and interpersonal disruption as part of the total cost of achieving the risk-reducing benefits of prophylactic mastectomy. While women in our study generally reported lack of regret, they also described distress in deciding about PM and in the complex post-surgical adjustment which PM necessitated in their view of themselves. This distress seemed to provide much of the motivation for the acceptability of psychological consultation in this setting. The family histories of the women in this study suggest additional reasons why psychological consultation might be seen as helpful to decision-making and post-surgical adaptation related to PM, especially for healthy women considering bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. Two-thirds of the women in the BPM group had mothers who died of breast cancer. Many of these participants were very young when their mother died. The decision to undergo PM was closely tied for many of these women with their early experience of their mother’s illness and, in many cases, her death [ Patenaude 2005 ]. One woman, for example, reported hearing her (dead) mother’s voice as she emerged from anesthesia for PM surgery, telling her she had done the right thing. It seems likely that a psychological consultation around PM decision-making could help some women cope with unresolved grief and lingering distress about past losses which may be aroused by consideration of PM. Such discussions are often beyond the scope and time limitations of typical pre-surgical visits, but may be crucial to optimal decision-making. It is also likely that several different specialized psychological consultation models may be needed to address the needs of all women who consider PM. Those from hereditary cancer families with multiple experiences of loss due to breast or ovarian cancer who consider PM might be expected to have different issues arise from, say, women with little or no family history who learn of their mutation status just after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Further research may elucidate the value of various targeted approaches for psychological intervention. The demographics and family cancer histories of the subjects in this research illustrate changing dynamics among PM patients. Until the relatively recent public recognition of the hereditary links between breast and ovarian cancer, women from families experiencing only ovarian cancer may have had relatively little fear of breast cancer. The higher percentage of women in the COPM group with personal or family history of ovarian cancer reflects increasing awareness of the link between hereditary ovarian and breast cancer. Differences in time to consider PM and in family awareness of the relevant cancer risk may affect how women make their decision and how they react following surgery. In the BPM group about half of the subjects came from medical families. Information-seeking and family support may be quite different in such families than in families with less direct access to medical information. During the period when there were no hard data about the efficacy of PM, it may have been easier to make a decision to undergo PM if one came from a family which had a strong, intrinsic belief in the power of medicine. Researchers in Australia have also found that clinicians conducting an initial genetic counseling consultation to women from families with a high risk of breast cancer were more likely to discuss PM as an option if the woman had medical or allied health training [ Lobb 2004 ], suggesting that there may be a physician-associated bias as well. As PM is more widely offered to an increasing number of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, there may be an even greater need for psychological consultation for women who may not have other opportunities to discuss the option of PM with friends, colleagues, or relatives who are medical professionals. While many women felt that psychological consultation would be a valuable adjunct before and after PM, they also had strong feelings about the role of the therapist. The concern that a therapist might try to override an individual’s decision may be a projection onto the therapist of the negative views about PM from family and friends, which were reported by a number of women. In addition, patients wanted mental health professionals in the consultation role who had good knowledge of breast/ovarian cancer genetics, PM surgical techniques and reconstruction options, and post-surgical complications as well as emotional aftereffects. This suggests a need for additional specialized training of psycho-oncologists, who could provide targeted psychological services to the growing number of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. It was also clear that speaking to a peer had been helpful to many women considering PM. Many felt that this dialogue enabled them to answer questions which they were either too reserved or shy to ask professionals or which they felt professionals could not know first-hand. Questions about physical recovery following surgery, pain, postsurgical sexual functioning, feminine self-image, clothing, and nipple sensation, they felt, could be answered best by someone who herself had been through surgery. Some women met their peer face-to-face and, in some cases, the peer even offered to show the subject her post-surgical breasts. Women were, however, cognizant of some limitation to the comparisons that could be made, recognizing that differences in reconstruction choice, body type, cancer experience, or marital status might make differences between the women in their experience of PM. Nonetheless, this was a highly valued intervention for many women. Matching of the characteristics that were most pertinent for the woman considering PM to learn from her peer consultant could be optimized if the matching were done following the psychological consultation which could explore the value and limitations of the peer consultation for the particular patient. Limitations This study was limited by the retrospective nature of our inquiry to women who had undergone PM and by the fact that it involved subjects from only three institutions within one hospital system. In addition, for the COPM group, only 57% of invited women chose to participate. It is possible that those participating were women more conflicted or distressed about the PM decision than those who chose not to participate and, thus, interest in the use of psychological services might be overrepresented. However, given the uniform endorsement of psychological consultation among participants in this group, even if none of the decliners were of a similar mind, interest among women considering PM would still be above 50%. Our study did, however, include women at many points along the continuum of experience with PM, including women still weighing the pros and cons and women whose surgery ranged from 1–12 years in the past. It is noteworthy also that we did include women who had had one breast removed prophylactically in conjunction with or following removal of the other breast for invasive cancer or DCIS. Because we do not have information on type of reconstruction, we cannot comment specifically on the influence of various reconstructive techniques as factors in satisfaction or in desire for psychological services. Reports of dissatisfaction were not limited only to women who had undergone reconstruction, but were also expressed by women who had opted not to have reconstruction. Similarly, there were reports of satisfaction and reduced anxiety in both groups. Like most studies of genetic testing for breast cancer, our study sample was not culturally diverse, a reflection of the fact that a preponderance of women tested to date for BRCA1/2 are well-educated, high income Caucasian women [ Halbert 2005 ]. As access to and acceptance of genetic testing increases among minority populations in the future, further research will be needed to ascertain the support needs and acceptability of psychological consultation and peer support to women considering and undergoing PM from more heterogeneous backgrounds. Our sample size, while small by typical standards for quantitative research, is large for an in-depth, largely qualitative study. Our techniques yielded a narrative depth which provided a much more rounded picture of the PM experience than that currently available. Such a qualitative approach, while greatly deepening our understanding of the impact of PM and allowing room for uncovering of unforeseen areas of positive and negative outcomes can complicate reporting of findings. It is sometimes more difficult to draw comparisons from narratives as they may focus on disparate aspects of similar experiences. We optimized comparisons across subjects by combining open-ended questions with standard probes with some more structured questions about the acceptability and preferred nature of psychological services. We are also aware that it is possible that the fact that the interviews were conducted by psychologists might have led to reporting of a higher level of interest in psychological consultation than might have been the case otherwise. However, our concern about this is mitigated by the vivid descriptions women offered of the use to which they might have put such a consultation in their own experience, had it been offered. We also have conservatively counted as endorsers only those who unequivocally endorsed psychological consultation for PM, separating out those who felt it would be advisable for others, but that they would not have benefited. Also, at least among the BPM and UPM groups, there were women who were clearly willing to share their negative views on the utility of psychological consultation. A variety of social and medical factors may have differentially affected women in the different subject groups in this research. More of the women in the COPM group knew their BRCA1/2 status or had relatives who had undergone testing; most of the bilateral and unilateral PM subjects had had surgery prior to the availability of testing or were from families without known mutations. These factors can affect the clarity and certainty with which women approach PM surgery. Women in the COPM group were also more likely to have utilized psychotherapy generally, which may have contributed to their universal endorsement for presurgical consultation. These differences suggest that as PM is offered to a growing group of women who seek cancer genetic counseling or testing, careful comparison of demographic and family history information between samples will be important as a basis for understanding similarities or differences in PM outcomes between studies. Finally, our study reports attitudes towards utilization of psychological consultation, not actual acceptance of services.  DISCUSSION Stiefel et al. (1997) has commented that genetic counseling and testing will result in there being, “many persons who will not suffer from a psychiatric disorder per se, but who face a complex problem that leads to a variety of thoughts, feelings and behaviors that need to be understood in the context of the person’s history.

Women were, however, cognizant of some limitation to the comparisons that could be made, recognizing that differences in reconstruction choice, body type, cancer experience, or marital status might make differences between the women in their experience of PM. Nonetheless, this was a highly valued intervention for many women. Matching of the characteristics that were most pertinent for the woman considering PM to learn from her peer consultant could be optimized if the matching were done following the psychological consultation which could explore the value and limitations of the peer consultation for the particular patient. Limitations This study was limited by the retrospective nature of our inquiry to women who had undergone PM and by the fact that it involved subjects from only three institutions within one hospital system. In addition, for the COPM group, only 57% of invited women chose to participate. It is possible that those participating were women more conflicted or distressed about the PM decision than those who chose not to participate and, thus, interest in the use of psychological services might be overrepresented. However, given the uniform endorsement of psychological consultation among participants in this group, even if none of the decliners were of a similar mind, interest among women considering PM would still be above 50%. Our study did, however, include women at many points along the continuum of experience with PM, including women still weighing the pros and cons and women whose surgery ranged from 1–12 years in the past. It is noteworthy also that we did include women who had had one breast removed prophylactically in conjunction with or following removal of the other breast for invasive cancer or DCIS. Because we do not have information on type of reconstruction, we cannot comment specifically on the influence of various reconstructive techniques as factors in satisfaction or in desire for psychological services. Reports of dissatisfaction were not limited only to women who had undergone reconstruction, but were also expressed by women who had opted not to have reconstruction. Similarly, there were reports of satisfaction and reduced anxiety in both groups. Like most studies of genetic testing for breast cancer, our study sample was not culturally diverse, a reflection of the fact that a preponderance of women tested to date for BRCA1/2 are well-educated, high income Caucasian women [ Halbert 2005 ]. As access to and acceptance of genetic testing increases among minority populations in the future, further research will be needed to ascertain the support needs and acceptability of psychological consultation and peer support to women considering and undergoing PM from more heterogeneous backgrounds. Our sample size, while small by typical standards for quantitative research, is large for an in-depth, largely qualitative study. Our techniques yielded a narrative depth which provided a much more rounded picture of the PM experience than that currently available. Such a qualitative approach, while greatly deepening our understanding of the impact of PM and allowing room for uncovering of unforeseen areas of positive and negative outcomes can complicate reporting of findings. It is sometimes more difficult to draw comparisons from narratives as they may focus on disparate aspects of similar experiences. We optimized comparisons across subjects by combining open-ended questions with standard probes with some more structured questions about the acceptability and preferred nature of psychological services. We are also aware that it is possible that the fact that the interviews were conducted by psychologists might have led to reporting of a higher level of interest in psychological consultation than might have been the case otherwise. However, our concern about this is mitigated by the vivid descriptions women offered of the use to which they might have put such a consultation in their own experience, had it been offered. We also have conservatively counted as endorsers only those who unequivocally endorsed psychological consultation for PM, separating out those who felt it would be advisable for others, but that they would not have benefited. Also, at least among the BPM and UPM groups, there were women who were clearly willing to share their negative views on the utility of psychological consultation. A variety of social and medical factors may have differentially affected women in the different subject groups in this research. More of the women in the COPM group knew their BRCA1/2 status or had relatives who had undergone testing; most of the bilateral and unilateral PM subjects had had surgery prior to the availability of testing or were from families without known mutations. These factors can affect the clarity and certainty with which women approach PM surgery. Women in the COPM group were also more likely to have utilized psychotherapy generally, which may have contributed to their universal endorsement for presurgical consultation. These differences suggest that as PM is offered to a growing group of women who seek cancer genetic counseling or testing, careful comparison of demographic and family history information between samples will be important as a basis for understanding similarities or differences in PM outcomes between studies. Finally, our study reports attitudes towards utilization of psychological consultation, not actual acceptance of services.

CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the development of interventions offering psychological support to women who consider PM and to those who opt for PM, both pre- and postsurgery. They suggest a preference for standardizing inclusion of a mental health visit as part of the presurgical work-up and suggest a neutral therapist stance about PM and possible components of the consultation. Future research may focus on the development, acceptance and efficacy testing of a variety of possible intervention models. Additional targeting may be needed to meet the varied needs of women with and without personal cancer histories and with and without early experiences of breast and ovarian cancer-related loss. While cost was not considered by women in our relatively affluent sample to be a barrier to acceptance of psychological services, this may not be the case in groups with lower average incomes or less access to health insurance. The cost-effectiveness of psychological and peer consultation should also be investigated. It would be of considerable interest if the time spent in psychological consultation resulted in reduced time demands on surgeons pre and postoperatively. Further work will also be needed to help establish effective policies for determining critical matching factors for linking women considering PM and peer consultants. Cancer genetic testing offers the potential to reduce mortality and morbidity among women at increased hereditary risk for cancer by offering targeted risk reduction measures, such as PM. As genetic medicine becomes more integrated into general medical practice, multidisciplinary collaboration between physicians, surgeons, and mental health professionals in the provision of services targeted to high-risk patients may help optimize patient outcomes.
