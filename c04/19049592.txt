Genetic influences on ketogenic diet efficacy Summary An average of 15–20% of patients on the ketogenic diet (KD) experience a >50% reduction in seizure frequency; however, 10–40% discontinue the diet due to either a lack of response or adverse side effects. This variability in patient response raises the possibility that genetic factors may influence the efficacy of the KD. As a first step towards identifying these factors, we evaluated the ability of the KD to alter seizure thresholds in 4 commonly used inbred mouse strains: C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, A/J, and DBA/2J. We observed strain-specific differences, indicating that genetic factors are likely to influence efficacy.  Conclusion Here, we report results supporting the hypothesis that genetic factors influence the efficacy of the KD. Identification of the underlying genes would give us a better understanding of the mechanism of the KD and an opportunity to further improve upon the diet.  Figure Figure 1 The effects of the KD on seizure thresholds, body weight, and glucose and ?-hydroxybutyrate levels are strain dependent. Following the administration of either the KD or standard chow for two weeks, (A) thresholds to flurothyl-induced seizures were determined. There were no differences in the time to the GTCS in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice on either the KD or control diet. FVB/NJ mice on the KD diet exhibited increased latency to GTCS, whereas A/J mice showed reduced latency. (B) No difference in weight was observed between C57BL/6J, A/J, and DBA/2J mice on the KD compared with their respective control groups. However, FVB/NJ mice on the KD showed a statistically significant increase in weight compared with their littermates on standard rodent chow. (C) ?HB levels in KD-fed mice were elevated compared with their control littermates. (D) All mice on KD maintained glucose levels that were comparable to their control littermates.
