Dietary approaches to healthy weight management for adolescents The New Moves model This paper describes the dietary component of New Moves, a school-based obesity prevention program for adolescent girls. New Moves is a multi-component intervention that integrates nutrition, social support and physical activity sessions within an all-girls physical education high school class. New Moves also includes individual counseling sessions using motivational interviewing techniques, follow-up group lunch meetings, and parent outreach activities. The nutrition component focuses on avoiding dieting and unhealthy weight control behaviors and adopting lifelong healthy eating behaviors, such as increasing fruit and vegetable intake, decreasing sweetened beverage intake, eating breakfast daily, and paying attention to internal signs of hunger and satiety.  Conclusions Prior to completing the evaluation of the New Moves intervention, conclusions cannot be drawn as to whether or not the dietary approach being utilized will be effective in helping the girls make behavioral changes. Our early impressions are that the girls, teachers, and parents are very satisfied with the New Moves approach. However, we are also well aware of the difficulties inherent to behavioral change and weight management. If proven successful, it is our hope that the New Moves model will be incorporated within high schools. It appears that group education (e.g., Be Fueled), personal attention (e.g., individual sessions with a New Moves coach), availability of healthy food options (e.g., lunch bunches), and family involvement, are important components of a dietary intervention for healthy weight management among adolescents.
