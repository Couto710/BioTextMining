Occludin oligomeric assemblies at tight junctions of the blood–brain barrier are altered by hypoxia and reoxygenation stress Hypoxic (low oxygen) and reperfusion (post-hypoxic reoxygenation) phases of stroke promote an increase in microvascular permeability at tight junctions (TJs) of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) that may lead to cerebral edema. To investigate the effect of hypoxia (Hx) and reoxygenation on oligomeric assemblies of the transmembrane TJ protein occludin, rats were subjected to either normoxia (Nx, 21% O2, 60 min), Hx (6% O2, 60 min), or hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R, 6% O2, 60 min followed by 21% O2, 10 min). After treatment, cerebral microvessels were isolated, fractionated by detergent-free density gradient centrifugation, and occludin oligomeric assemblies associated with plasma membrane lipid rafts were solubilized by perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFO) exclusively as high molecular weight protein complexes. Analysis by non-reducing and reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/western blot of PFO-solubilized occludin revealed that occludin oligomeric assemblies co-localizing with ‘TJ-associated’ raft domains contained a high molecular weight ‘structural core’ that was resistant to disassembly by either SDS or a hydrophilic reducing agent ex vivo , and by Hx and H/R conditions in vivo . However, exposure of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies to SDS ex vivo revealed the non-covalent association of a significant amount of dimeric and monomeric occludin isoforms to the disulfide-bonded inner core, and dispersal of these non-covalently attached occludin subunits to lipid rafts of higher density in vivo was differentially promoted by Hx and H/R. Our data suggest a model of isoform interaction within occludin oligomeric assemblies at the BBB that enables occludin to simultaneously perform a structural role in inhibiting paracellular diffusion, and a signaling role involving interactions of dimeric and monomeric occludin isoforms with a variety of regulatory molecules within different plasma membrane lipid raft domains.

Animals were randomly assigned to each treatment group, and all treatment protocols were approved by the University of Arizona Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and abide by National Institutes of Health guidelines. In vivo hypoxic conditions were created in an oxygen-controlled normobaric Hx chamber (COY Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI, USA) as previously described ( Witt et al. 2003 , 2005 , 2008 ). Rats received 1.0 mL/kg i.p. of anesthetic cocktail (in mg/mL: 78.3 ketamine, 3.1 xylazine, and 0.6 acepromazine). Anesthetized animals were subjected to Nx (21% O2 for 60 min), Hx (6% O2 for 60 min), or H/R (Hx for 60 min followed by Nx for 10 min). Body temperature was maintained at 37°C with a heating pad (Harvard Apparatus, South Watwick, MA, USA). At the end of the treatment, blood was collected from the descending aorta via heparinized tubes (BD Vacutainer; Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and immediately analyzed for blood gas and electrolyte concentrations using an ABL77 blood gas analyzer (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark) to validate the degree of hypoxic insult at 6% O2 compared with normoxic controls ( n = 6 rats).

Results <italic>In vivo</italic> model of hypoxia-reoxygenation Our laboratory has previously characterized an in vivo rat model of global H/R stress that promotes increased BBB TJ permeability and vasogenic brain edema. In this model, anesthetized animals were subjected to acute Hx (6% O2 for 60 min) followed by a brief period of reoxygenation (21% O2 for 10 min) ( Witt et al. 2003 , 2005 , 2008 ). In the present study, identical conditions of H/R were used, and for comparison, additional sets of anesthetized animals were subjected either to Nx (21% O2 for 60 min) or Hx alone (6% O2 for 60 min). Immediately following treatment, blood chemistries were determined to provide a measure of the hypoxic insult ( Table 1 ). The partial pressure of O2 decreased 73% during Hx, returning to Nx levels during H/R. The percent saturation of hemoglobin for O2 decreased during Hx from 98% to 71%, returning to 98% with H/R. The partial pressure of CO2 decreased 61% during Hx, returning to 31% below Nx levels during reoxygenation. Blood pH increased from 7.42 ± 0.01 (Nx) to 7.53 ± 0.02 (Hx), then returned to 7.42 ± 0.02 (H/R). Ca2+ concentration decreased approximately 13% during Hx and remained 9% below Nx levels in H/R. The K+ concentration, on the other hand, remained at Nx levels during Hx but decreased 22% during H/R. Na+ and Cl? concentrations did not change significantly during the course of Hx or H/R. Confocal microscopy of isolated cerebral microvessels To provide a global assessment of Hx- and H/R-induced changes in localization of the TJ transmembrane protein occludin, cerebral microvessels were isolated from Nx-, Hx-, and H/R-treated animals and analyzed by confocal microscopy following immunostaining for both occludin (using the Zymed 71-1500 polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminus of occludin; Fig. 1a–c ) and PECAM-1 ( Fig. 1a–c insets). Occludin staining in cerebral microvessels from Nx-treated animals showed a continuous, sharply defined pattern of a single line marking the paracellular clefts of adjacent PECAM-1 immunoreactive endothelial cells. Hx treatment greatly reduced occludin immunoreactivity within cerebral microvessels, promoting a loss of occludin staining from the paracellular clefts and the fragmenting of occludin staining along the length of the microvessel. H/R treatment increased occludin staining at the paracellular cleft compared with that observed following Hx treatment. Although H/R treatment re-established sharply defined paracellular occludin immunoreactivity along stretches of the microvessel, this was accompanied with the appearance of diffuse occludin immunoreactivity within (and also immediately beneath) the plasma membrane that was punctuated by sites of more intense staining ( Fig. 1c ). No change was observed in microvascular PECAM-1 staining during Hx or H/R. Density gradient fractionation of cerebral microvessels To investigate on a molecular level, the effects of Hx and H/R on occludin oligomeric assemblies at TJs of the BBB, intact cerebral microvessels from Nx-, Hx-, and H/R-treated animals were fractionated by detergent-free OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation. This procedure separated ‘TJ-associated’ plasma membrane lipid rafts co-localizing with occludin multiprotein complexes from non-raft membranous structures and soluble cytoplasmic components ( Macdonald and Pike 2005 ; McCaffrey et al. 2007 , 2008 ). Fractionation of Nx-, Hx-, and H/R microvessel samples produced gradients with almost identical profiles for fraction density and protein content ( Fig. 2a ). Average fraction density (?) increased linearly from 1.042 g/mL (top of gradient) to 1.161 g/mL (bottom of gradient). Screening of density gradient fractions by SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis for Rab13 and caveolin-1 (previously shown to co-localize with ‘TJ-associated’ plasma membrane lipid rafts ( McCaffrey et al. 2007 , 2008 ), and nucleoporin (nuclear membrane marker) confirmed the separation of low density, plasma membrane lipid raft domains (fractions 5–10; ? = 1.067–1.111 g/mL) from higher density, and non-raft membranous structures (fractions 12–15; ? = 1.121–1.147 g/mL) ( Fig. 2b ). During steady-state (Nx), staining for Rab13 was restricted to fractions 7 and 8. Hx simultaneously promoted an increase of Rab13 staining in the lower density fractions 5 and 6, and a decrease in Rab13 staining in fractions 7 and 8. H/R reversed this trend, decreasing the amount of Rab13 staining in the lower density fractions and increasing the amount in fractions 7 and 8. Similar to Rab13, caveolin-1 staining was differentially modulated by Hx and H/R, with Hx inducing a decrease in association of this scaffolding protein with plasma membrane lipid rafts and H/R reversing this trend. PFO–PAGE of solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies Previously, our laboratory used subcellular fractionation and SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of isolated cerebral microvessels to identify the presence of oligomeric (>150 kDa), dimeric (~110–120 kDa), monomeric (53–65 kDa), and low molecular weight (LMW, 37–25 kDa) occludin isoforms within occludin oligomeric assemblies at TJs of the BBB. Treatment of density gradient fractions with the hydrophobic reducing agent 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) effectively reduced oligomeric and dimeric occludin isoforms to monomeric and LMW isoforms, confirming a role for hydrophobic disulfide bonds in formation of higher order occludin oligomeric structures ( McCaffrey et al. 2007 , 2008 ). In this study, to provide more detailed information about the structural integrity and molecular composition of raft-associated occludin oligomeric assemblies, density gradient fractions were first extracted with PFO, and then the PFO extracts were subjected to either non-reducing PFO–PAGE or non-reducing or reducing SDS–PAGE. Unlike the strongly ionic detergent SDS which breaks non-covalent interactions between proteins and promotes disassembly of multimeric proteins, PFO maintains hydrophobic interactions between subunits of multiprotein complexes and preserves the quaternary structure of multimeric proteins ( Ramjeesingh et al. 1999 ). The optimal concentration of PFO necessary to solubilize occludin was determined by control experiments using equal protein aliquots of microvessel homogenates in which increasing amounts of PFO were used to solubilize occludin. PFO extracts were subjected to reducing SDS–PAGE in the presence of TCEP, and the corresponding western blots were probed with the Zymed 71-1500 antibody to the C-terminus of occludin. As the concentration of PFO increased from 0.5% to 4%, the amount of occludin in the supernatant and corresponding pellet increased and decreased, respectively, and 2% PFO was found sufficient to solubilize all occludin present within microvessel homogenates (data not shown). Aliquots of density gradient fractions 5–10 (plasma membrane lipid rafts, ? = 1.067–1.111 g/mL) solubilized by 2% PFO were subjected to non-reducing PFO–PAGE ( Fig. 3a–c ) to provide confirmation of the solubilization of occludin as high molecular weight (>250 kDa) multiprotein occludin structures associated with plasma membrane lipid rafts. In Nx samples ( Fig. 3a ), occludin oligomeric assemblies were prominently detected in the low density fractions 7 and 8 (? = 1.081–1.100 g/mL) and to a lesser extent in the higher density fraction 10 (? = 1.111 g/mL). Density measurements of western blots revealed that Hx treatment promoted a dramatic reduction in the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies that could be detected in fraction 7 ( Fig. 3b ), the previously characterized low density ‘TJ-associated’ lipid raft domain ( McCaffrey et al. 2007 , 2008 ). H/R treatment increased the detectability of PFO-solubilized oligomeric occludin in fraction 7 ( Fig. 3c ). Hx treatment also decreased the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomer detectable in fraction 8, concomitantly increasing the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomer detectable in fractions 6, 9, and 10 ( Fig. 3b ). H/R treatment almost completely restored the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomer present in fraction 8 to its pre-Hx value ( Fig. 3c ). Non-reducing SDS–PAGE of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies To identify Hx- and H/R-induced changes in the type and relative amounts of monomeric occludin isoforms that were attached by non-covalent (hydrophobic) interactions to higher order occludin structures at the TJ and adjacent plasma membrane domains, aliquots of PFO extracts of density gradient fractions 5–10 (plasma membrane lipid rafts, ? = 1.067–1.111 g/mL) that were visualized by non-reducing PFO–PAGE ( Fig. 3a–c ) were heated for 10 min at 70°C in the presence of 2% SDS, and then subjected to non-reducing SDS–PAGE. The resultant western blots were probed with the Zymed 71-1500 antibody to the C-terminus of occludin ( Fig. 3d–f ). Multiple film exposures were taken for each set of blots (containing Nx, Hx, and H/R samples) to enhance detection of less-abundant occludin isoforms, and to ensure that for a particular occludin isoform, qualitative assessment of relative densities could be made within the linear range of the film. Western blots shown in Fig. 3d*–f* represent prolonged film exposures of western blots shown in Fig. 3d–f . Non-reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of PFO-solubilized occludin from Nx samples ( Fig. 3d ) showed that during steady-state, the bulk of detectable occludin was associated with the ‘TJ-associated’ fraction 7 (? = 1.081 g/mL) and the slightly higher density fraction 8 (? = 1.100 g/mL). Occludin oligomeric assemblies in fractions 7 and 8 were revealed to have appreciable amounts of dimeric (110 kDa) and monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms attached by SDS-sensitive (hydrophobic) interactions to higher order occludin structures. This finding was more evident in the prolonged film exposure shown in Fig. 3d* , which in addition revealed the presence in fraction 10 of dimeric (107 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms. To more readily discern relationships between oligomeric, dimeric, and monomeric occludin isoforms within either fraction 7 or 8, Fig. 3j was constructed to show western blots for each fraction separately aligned according to SDS–PAGE conditions (non-reducing and reducing) and treatment conditions (Nx, Hx, and H/R). In addition, Fig. 3k was prepared using enhanced film exposures of western blots of non-reducing SDS–PAGE for fractions 7 and 8 in which the oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms could more easily be detected. Taken together, Fig. 3d, 3d*, 3j and 3k show that the lower density, more tightly-packed ‘TJ-associated’ lipid rafts (fraction 7) not only had detectable amounts of both the ~290 and ~260 kDa occludin oligomeric isoforms, but also relatively higher oligomeric/dimeric and dimeric/monomeric occludin isoform ratios, than did the higher density, less tightly-packed lipid rafts (fraction 8). The amount of non-covalently bound, monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms present in the ‘TJ-associated’ fraction 7 was dramatically reduced by Hx treatment, and this was accompanied by a reduction in the ~290 kDa occludin isoform and an increase in the ~260 kDa occludin isoform ( Fig. 3e, 3e*, 3j, 3k ). Hx treatment also caused a discernible decrease in the amount of monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 8, and the additional appearance of occludin isoforms at 93 and 42 kDa ( Fig. 3e ), and at 37, 27, and 24 kDa ( Fig. 3e* ). Reduced staining of monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms in the lower density fractions 7 and 8 occurred simultaneously with marked increases in the amount of dimeric (107 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms detectable in the higher density fractions 9 and 10, and of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms visible in the lower density fraction 6 ( Fig. 3e* ). Western blots of non-reducing SDS–PAGE from H/R samples ( Fig. 3f, 3f* ) showed that H/R treatment dramatically restored the staining of monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms in the ‘TJ-associated’ fraction 7. Simultaneously, H/R increased the amount of these monomeric isoforms detected in fraction 8, and the amount of the 56 and 52 kDa monomeric isoforms in fractions 9 and 10. The amount of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 6 was reduced by H/R as was the visibility of the 37 kDa occludin isoform in fraction 8. The relative amounts of the presumed dimeric (107 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms in fractions 9 and 10 were altered such that, especially in fraction 9, a distinct decrease in the dimeric (107 kDa) occludin isoform coincided with a marked increase in the monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms. Reducing SDS–PAGE of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies To identify Hx- and H/R-induced changes in the type and relative amounts of occludin isoforms that were attached by covalent (disulfide bond) interactions to higher order occludin structures at the TJ, replicate aliquots of PFO extracts of density gradient fractions 5–10 were also heated for 10 min at 70°C in the presence of 2% SDS and the hydrophilic reducing agent TCEP, and then subjected to SDS–PAGE/western blot and probed with the Zymed 71-1500 antibody to the C-terminus of occludin ( Fig. 3g–i ). Western blots shown in Fig. 3g*–i* represent prolonged film exposures of western blots shown in Fig. 3g–i . Reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of PFO extracts from Nx samples (fraction 7, Fig. 3g ) revealed that exposure of ‘TJ-associated’ occludin oligomeric assemblies to the hydrophilic reducing agent TCEP markedly increased the detectability of the oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms ( Fig. 3g* and j ). In addition, TCEP reduction slightly increased the staining of the 55 and 51 kDa occludin isoforms (compare Fig. 3g* and d* ) and promoted the appearance of 93, 62, and 42 kDa occludin isoforms ( Fig. 3g* ). In contrast, TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies associated with higher density lipid rafts (fraction 10) reduced the staining for oligomeric (>250 kDa) occludin isoforms, increased staining for dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms, and induced the appearance of a 43 kDa occludin isoform ( Fig. 3g* ). Interestingly, following TCEP reduction, all dimeric occludin isoforms detected in fractions 7–10 appeared at the same molecular weight (110 kDa); monomeric (56, 52, and 43 kDa) occludin isoforms were detected only in fraction 10, and LMW (27 and 24 kDa) occludin isoforms were discernible only in fraction 8 ( Fig. 3g* ). Reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of ‘TJ-associated’ PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples emphatically increased the staining of monomeric (51 kDa) occludin isoforms (fraction 7, Fig. 3h ). Moreover, comparison of non-reducing (fraction 7, Fig. 3e* ) and reducing (fraction 7, Fig. 3h* ) western blots for TJ-associated’ PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples showed that exposure to TCEP enhanced staining for oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms as well as the staining for occludin isoforms of 93, 65, 62, and 42 kDa. In addition, staining of 55 and 51 kDa occludin isoforms was markedly increased. TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples also increased staining of oligomeric (~290 kDa) and dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 6 and allowed detection of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 5 ( Fig 3h* ). In contrast, TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples associated with relatively higher density lipid rafts (fractions 9 and 10) caused simultaneously reduced staining for oligomeric (>250 kDa) occludin isoforms, increased staining for dimeric (110 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms and the appearance of the 43 kDa occludin isoform ( Fig. 3e* and h* ). In fraction 8, comparison of non-reducing ( Fig. 3e ) and reducing ( Fig. 3h ) western blots for TJ-associated’ PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples showed that TCEP reduction not only markedly increased staining for the higher molecular weight oligomeric (~290 kDa) occludin isoform but also caused the disappearance of the dimeric (93 kDa) occludin isoform and the enhanced detection of the monomeric (55, 51, and 42 kDa) occludin isoforms. Moreover, comparison of band densities for monomeric (55, 51, and 42 kDa) occludin isoforms detected in non-reducing ( Fig. 3e and e* ) and reducing ( Fig. 3h and h* ) blots for fractions 7 and 8 showed that TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples produced distinctly different patterns for the ‘TJ-associated’ lipid rafts (fraction 7) and lipid rafts of a slightly higher density (fraction 8). Reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from H/R samples greatly increased staining for oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms in fractions 7 and 8 (compare Fig. 3f* and i* ). However, in comparison to Hx samples, in both fractions 7 and 8, staining for the ~290 occludin isoform was decreased, and staining for the ~260 kDa occludin isoform was increased ( Fig. 3j ). In addition, there was decreased staining of the ~290 kDa occludin isoform in the lower density fraction 6, and increased staining of higher molecular weight (>250 kDa) occludin isoforms in the higher density fractions 9 and 10 (compare Fig. 3h* and i* ). Detection of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms with lower density fractions 5 and 6 was also decreased by H/R, simultaneously with slight increases in detection of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in the higher density fractions 9 and 10 (compare Fig. 3h* and i* ). TCEP reduction increased staining in fractions 7 and 8 for monomeric (62, 55, 51, and 43 kDa) occludin isoforms, and staining in fractions 9 and 10 for monomeric (56, 52, and 43 kDa) occludin isoforms (compare Fig. 3f* and i* ). In addition, TCEP reduction increased staining in fraction 8 for LMW (37, 33, 27, and 24 kDa) occludin isoforms. Comparison of Fig. 3i* and h* showed that although H/R caused the disappearance of the 65 kDa occludin isoform, the staining for LMW (37, 33, 27, and 24 kDa) occludin isoforms was not altered.  Results <italic>In vivo</italic> model of hypoxia-reoxygenation Our laboratory has previously characterized an in vivo rat model of global H/R stress that promotes increased BBB TJ permeability and vasogenic brain edema. In this model, anesthetized animals were subjected to acute Hx (6% O2 for 60 min) followed by a brief period of reoxygenation (21% O2 for 10 min) ( Witt et al. 2003 , 2005 , 2008 ). In the present study, identical conditions of H/R were used, and for comparison, additional sets of anesthetized animals were subjected either to Nx (21% O2 for 60 min) or Hx alone (6% O2 for 60 min). Immediately following treatment, blood chemistries were determined to provide a measure of the hypoxic insult ( Table 1 ). The partial pressure of O2 decreased 73% during Hx, returning to Nx levels during H/R. The percent saturation of hemoglobin for O2 decreased during Hx from 98% to 71%, returning to 98% with H/R. The partial pressure of CO2 decreased 61% during Hx, returning to 31% below Nx levels during reoxygenation. Blood pH increased from 7.42 ± 0.01 (Nx) to 7.53 ± 0.02 (Hx), then returned to 7.42 ± 0.02 (H/R). Ca2+ concentration decreased approximately 13% during Hx and remained 9% below Nx levels in H/R. The K+ concentration, on the other hand, remained at Nx levels during Hx but decreased 22% during H/R. Na+ and Cl? concentrations did not change significantly during the course of Hx or H/R. Confocal microscopy of isolated cerebral microvessels To provide a global assessment of Hx- and H/R-induced changes in localization of the TJ transmembrane protein occludin, cerebral microvessels were isolated from Nx-, Hx-, and H/R-treated animals and analyzed by confocal microscopy following immunostaining for both occludin (using the Zymed 71-1500 polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminus of occludin; Fig. 1a–c ) and PECAM-1 ( Fig. 1a–c insets). Occludin staining in cerebral microvessels from Nx-treated animals showed a continuous, sharply defined pattern of a single line marking the paracellular clefts of adjacent PECAM-1 immunoreactive endothelial cells. Hx treatment greatly reduced occludin immunoreactivity within cerebral microvessels, promoting a loss of occludin staining from the paracellular clefts and the fragmenting of occludin staining along the length of the microvessel. H/R treatment increased occludin staining at the paracellular cleft compared with that observed following Hx treatment. Although H/R treatment re-established sharply defined paracellular occludin immunoreactivity along stretches of the microvessel, this was accompanied with the appearance of diffuse occludin immunoreactivity within (and also immediately beneath) the plasma membrane that was punctuated by sites of more intense staining ( Fig. 1c ). No change was observed in microvascular PECAM-1 staining during Hx or H/R. Density gradient fractionation of cerebral microvessels To investigate on a molecular level, the effects of Hx and H/R on occludin oligomeric assemblies at TJs of the BBB, intact cerebral microvessels from Nx-, Hx-, and H/R-treated animals were fractionated by detergent-free OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation. This procedure separated ‘TJ-associated’ plasma membrane lipid rafts co-localizing with occludin multiprotein complexes from non-raft membranous structures and soluble cytoplasmic components ( Macdonald and Pike 2005 ; McCaffrey et al. 2007 , 2008 ). Fractionation of Nx-, Hx-, and H/R microvessel samples produced gradients with almost identical profiles for fraction density and protein content ( Fig. 2a ). Average fraction density (?) increased linearly from 1.042 g/mL (top of gradient) to 1.161 g/mL (bottom of gradient). Screening of density gradient fractions by SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis for Rab13 and caveolin-1 (previously shown to co-localize with ‘TJ-associated’ plasma membrane lipid rafts ( McCaffrey et al. 2007 , 2008 ), and nucleoporin (nuclear membrane marker) confirmed the separation of low density, plasma membrane lipid raft domains (fractions 5–10; ? = 1.067–1.111 g/mL) from higher density, and non-raft membranous structures (fractions 12–15; ? = 1.121–1.147 g/mL) ( Fig. 2b ). During steady-state (Nx), staining for Rab13 was restricted to fractions 7 and 8. Hx simultaneously promoted an increase of Rab13 staining in the lower density fractions 5 and 6, and a decrease in Rab13 staining in fractions 7 and 8. H/R reversed this trend, decreasing the amount of Rab13 staining in the lower density fractions and increasing the amount in fractions 7 and 8. Similar to Rab13, caveolin-1 staining was differentially modulated by Hx and H/R, with Hx inducing a decrease in association of this scaffolding protein with plasma membrane lipid rafts and H/R reversing this trend. PFO–PAGE of solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies Previously, our laboratory used subcellular fractionation and SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of isolated cerebral microvessels to identify the presence of oligomeric (>150 kDa), dimeric (~110–120 kDa), monomeric (53–65 kDa), and low molecular weight (LMW, 37–25 kDa) occludin isoforms within occludin oligomeric assemblies at TJs of the BBB. Treatment of density gradient fractions with the hydrophobic reducing agent 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) effectively reduced oligomeric and dimeric occludin isoforms to monomeric and LMW isoforms, confirming a role for hydrophobic disulfide bonds in formation of higher order occludin oligomeric structures ( McCaffrey et al. 2007 , 2008 ). In this study, to provide more detailed information about the structural integrity and molecular composition of raft-associated occludin oligomeric assemblies, density gradient fractions were first extracted with PFO, and then the PFO extracts were subjected to either non-reducing PFO–PAGE or non-reducing or reducing SDS–PAGE. Unlike the strongly ionic detergent SDS which breaks non-covalent interactions between proteins and promotes disassembly of multimeric proteins, PFO maintains hydrophobic interactions between subunits of multiprotein complexes and preserves the quaternary structure of multimeric proteins ( Ramjeesingh et al. 1999 ). The optimal concentration of PFO necessary to solubilize occludin was determined by control experiments using equal protein aliquots of microvessel homogenates in which increasing amounts of PFO were used to solubilize occludin. PFO extracts were subjected to reducing SDS–PAGE in the presence of TCEP, and the corresponding western blots were probed with the Zymed 71-1500 antibody to the C-terminus of occludin. As the concentration of PFO increased from 0.5% to 4%, the amount of occludin in the supernatant and corresponding pellet increased and decreased, respectively, and 2% PFO was found sufficient to solubilize all occludin present within microvessel homogenates (data not shown). Aliquots of density gradient fractions 5–10 (plasma membrane lipid rafts, ? = 1.067–1.111 g/mL) solubilized by 2% PFO were subjected to non-reducing PFO–PAGE ( Fig. 3a–c ) to provide confirmation of the solubilization of occludin as high molecular weight (>250 kDa) multiprotein occludin structures associated with plasma membrane lipid rafts. In Nx samples ( Fig. 3a ), occludin oligomeric assemblies were prominently detected in the low density fractions 7 and 8 (? = 1.081–1.100 g/mL) and to a lesser extent in the higher density fraction 10 (? = 1.111 g/mL). Density measurements of western blots revealed that Hx treatment promoted a dramatic reduction in the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies that could be detected in fraction 7 ( Fig. 3b ), the previously characterized low density ‘TJ-associated’ lipid raft domain ( McCaffrey et al. 2007 , 2008 ). H/R treatment increased the detectability of PFO-solubilized oligomeric occludin in fraction 7 ( Fig. 3c ). Hx treatment also decreased the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomer detectable in fraction 8, concomitantly increasing the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomer detectable in fractions 6, 9, and 10 ( Fig. 3b ). H/R treatment almost completely restored the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomer present in fraction 8 to its pre-Hx value ( Fig. 3c ). Non-reducing SDS–PAGE of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies To identify Hx- and H/R-induced changes in the type and relative amounts of monomeric occludin isoforms that were attached by non-covalent (hydrophobic) interactions to higher order occludin structures at the TJ and adjacent plasma membrane domains, aliquots of PFO extracts of density gradient fractions 5–10 (plasma membrane lipid rafts, ? = 1.067–1.111 g/mL) that were visualized by non-reducing PFO–PAGE ( Fig. 3a–c ) were heated for 10 min at 70°C in the presence of 2% SDS, and then subjected to non-reducing SDS–PAGE. The resultant western blots were probed with the Zymed 71-1500 antibody to the C-terminus of occludin ( Fig. 3d–f ). Multiple film exposures were taken for each set of blots (containing Nx, Hx, and H/R samples) to enhance detection of less-abundant occludin isoforms, and to ensure that for a particular occludin isoform, qualitative assessment of relative densities could be made within the linear range of the film. Western blots shown in Fig. 3d*–f* represent prolonged film exposures of western blots shown in Fig. 3d–f . Non-reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of PFO-solubilized occludin from Nx samples ( Fig. 3d ) showed that during steady-state, the bulk of detectable occludin was associated with the ‘TJ-associated’ fraction 7 (? = 1.081 g/mL) and the slightly higher density fraction 8 (? = 1.100 g/mL). Occludin oligomeric assemblies in fractions 7 and 8 were revealed to have appreciable amounts of dimeric (110 kDa) and monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms attached by SDS-sensitive (hydrophobic) interactions to higher order occludin structures. This finding was more evident in the prolonged film exposure shown in Fig. 3d* , which in addition revealed the presence in fraction 10 of dimeric (107 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms. To more readily discern relationships between oligomeric, dimeric, and monomeric occludin isoforms within either fraction 7 or 8, Fig. 3j was constructed to show western blots for each fraction separately aligned according to SDS–PAGE conditions (non-reducing and reducing) and treatment conditions (Nx, Hx, and H/R). In addition, Fig. 3k was prepared using enhanced film exposures of western blots of non-reducing SDS–PAGE for fractions 7 and 8 in which the oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms could more easily be detected. Taken together, Fig. 3d, 3d*, 3j and 3k show that the lower density, more tightly-packed ‘TJ-associated’ lipid rafts (fraction 7) not only had detectable amounts of both the ~290 and ~260 kDa occludin oligomeric isoforms, but also relatively higher oligomeric/dimeric and dimeric/monomeric occludin isoform ratios, than did the higher density, less tightly-packed lipid rafts (fraction 8). The amount of non-covalently bound, monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms present in the ‘TJ-associated’ fraction 7 was dramatically reduced by Hx treatment, and this was accompanied by a reduction in the ~290 kDa occludin isoform and an increase in the ~260 kDa occludin isoform ( Fig. 3e, 3e*, 3j, 3k ). Hx treatment also caused a discernible decrease in the amount of monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 8, and the additional appearance of occludin isoforms at 93 and 42 kDa ( Fig. 3e ), and at 37, 27, and 24 kDa ( Fig. 3e* ). Reduced staining of monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms in the lower density fractions 7 and 8 occurred simultaneously with marked increases in the amount of dimeric (107 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms detectable in the higher density fractions 9 and 10, and of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms visible in the lower density fraction 6 ( Fig. 3e* ). Western blots of non-reducing SDS–PAGE from H/R samples ( Fig. 3f, 3f* ) showed that H/R treatment dramatically restored the staining of monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms in the ‘TJ-associated’ fraction 7. Simultaneously, H/R increased the amount of these monomeric isoforms detected in fraction 8, and the amount of the 56 and 52 kDa monomeric isoforms in fractions 9 and 10. The amount of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 6 was reduced by H/R as was the visibility of the 37 kDa occludin isoform in fraction 8. The relative amounts of the presumed dimeric (107 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms in fractions 9 and 10 were altered such that, especially in fraction 9, a distinct decrease in the dimeric (107 kDa) occludin isoform coincided with a marked increase in the monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms. Reducing SDS–PAGE of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies To identify Hx- and H/R-induced changes in the type and relative amounts of occludin isoforms that were attached by covalent (disulfide bond) interactions to higher order occludin structures at the TJ, replicate aliquots of PFO extracts of density gradient fractions 5–10 were also heated for 10 min at 70°C in the presence of 2% SDS and the hydrophilic reducing agent TCEP, and then subjected to SDS–PAGE/western blot and probed with the Zymed 71-1500 antibody to the C-terminus of occludin ( Fig. 3g–i ). Western blots shown in Fig. 3g*–i* represent prolonged film exposures of western blots shown in Fig. 3g–i . Reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of PFO extracts from Nx samples (fraction 7, Fig. 3g ) revealed that exposure of ‘TJ-associated’ occludin oligomeric assemblies to the hydrophilic reducing agent TCEP markedly increased the detectability of the oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms ( Fig. 3g* and j ). In addition, TCEP reduction slightly increased the staining of the 55 and 51 kDa occludin isoforms (compare Fig. 3g* and d* ) and promoted the appearance of 93, 62, and 42 kDa occludin isoforms ( Fig. 3g* ). In contrast, TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies associated with higher density lipid rafts (fraction 10) reduced the staining for oligomeric (>250 kDa) occludin isoforms, increased staining for dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms, and induced the appearance of a 43 kDa occludin isoform ( Fig. 3g* ). Interestingly, following TCEP reduction, all dimeric occludin isoforms detected in fractions 7–10 appeared at the same molecular weight (110 kDa); monomeric (56, 52, and 43 kDa) occludin isoforms were detected only in fraction 10, and LMW (27 and 24 kDa) occludin isoforms were discernible only in fraction 8 ( Fig. 3g* ). Reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of ‘TJ-associated’ PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples emphatically increased the staining of monomeric (51 kDa) occludin isoforms (fraction 7, Fig. 3h ). Moreover, comparison of non-reducing (fraction 7, Fig. 3e* ) and reducing (fraction 7, Fig. 3h* ) western blots for TJ-associated’ PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples showed that exposure to TCEP enhanced staining for oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms as well as the staining for occludin isoforms of 93, 65, 62, and 42 kDa. In addition, staining of 55 and 51 kDa occludin isoforms was markedly increased. TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples also increased staining of oligomeric (~290 kDa) and dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 6 and allowed detection of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 5 ( Fig 3h* ). In contrast, TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples associated with relatively higher density lipid rafts (fractions 9 and 10) caused simultaneously reduced staining for oligomeric (>250 kDa) occludin isoforms, increased staining for dimeric (110 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms and the appearance of the 43 kDa occludin isoform ( Fig. 3e* and h* ). In fraction 8, comparison of non-reducing ( Fig. 3e ) and reducing ( Fig. 3h ) western blots for TJ-associated’ PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples showed that TCEP reduction not only markedly increased staining for the higher molecular weight oligomeric (~290 kDa) occludin isoform but also caused the disappearance of the dimeric (93 kDa) occludin isoform and the enhanced detection of the monomeric (55, 51, and 42 kDa) occludin isoforms. Moreover, comparison of band densities for monomeric (55, 51, and 42 kDa) occludin isoforms detected in non-reducing ( Fig. 3e and e* ) and reducing ( Fig. 3h and h* ) blots for fractions 7 and 8 showed that TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples produced distinctly different patterns for the ‘TJ-associated’ lipid rafts (fraction 7) and lipid rafts of a slightly higher density (fraction 8). Reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from H/R samples greatly increased staining for oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms in fractions 7 and 8 (compare Fig. 3f* and i* ). However, in comparison to Hx samples, in both fractions 7 and 8, staining for the ~290 occludin isoform was decreased, and staining for the ~260 kDa occludin isoform was increased ( Fig. 3j ). In addition, there was decreased staining of the ~290 kDa occludin isoform in the lower density fraction 6, and increased staining of higher molecular weight (>250 kDa) occludin isoforms in the higher density fractions 9 and 10 (compare Fig. 3h* and i* ). Detection of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms with lower density fractions 5 and 6 was also decreased by H/R, simultaneously with slight increases in detection of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in the higher density fractions 9 and 10 (compare Fig. 3h* and i* ). TCEP reduction increased staining in fractions 7 and 8 for monomeric (62, 55, 51, and 43 kDa) occludin isoforms, and staining in fractions 9 and 10 for monomeric (56, 52, and 43 kDa) occludin isoforms (compare Fig. 3f* and i* ). In addition, TCEP reduction increased staining in fraction 8 for LMW (37, 33, 27, and 24 kDa) occludin isoforms. Comparison of Fig. 3i* and h* showed that although H/R caused the disappearance of the 65 kDa occludin isoform, the staining for LMW (37, 33, 27, and 24 kDa) occludin isoforms was not altered.  <italic>In vivo</italic> model of hypoxia-reoxygenation Our laboratory has previously characterized an in vivo rat model of global H/R stress that promotes increased BBB TJ permeability and vasogenic brain edema. In this model, anesthetized animals were subjected to acute Hx (6% O2 for 60 min) followed by a brief period of reoxygenation (21% O2 for 10 min) ( Witt et al. 2003 , 2005 , 2008 ). In the present study, identical conditions of H/R were used, and for comparison, additional sets of anesthetized animals were subjected either to Nx (21% O2 for 60 min) or Hx alone (6% O2 for 60 min). Immediately following treatment, blood chemistries were determined to provide a measure of the hypoxic insult ( Table 1 ). The partial pressure of O2 decreased 73% during Hx, returning to Nx levels during H/R. The percent saturation of hemoglobin for O2 decreased during Hx from 98% to 71%, returning to 98% with H/R. The partial pressure of CO2 decreased 61% during Hx, returning to 31% below Nx levels during reoxygenation. Blood pH increased from 7.42 ± 0.01 (Nx) to 7.53 ± 0.02 (Hx), then returned to 7.42 ± 0.02 (H/R). Ca2+ concentration decreased approximately 13% during Hx and remained 9% below Nx levels in H/R. The K+ concentration, on the other hand, remained at Nx levels during Hx but decreased 22% during H/R. Na+ and Cl? concentrations did not change significantly during the course of Hx or H/R.  <italic>In vivo</italic> model of hypoxia-reoxygenation Our laboratory has previously characterized an in vivo rat model of global H/R stress that promotes increased BBB TJ permeability and vasogenic brain edema.

Confocal microscopy of isolated cerebral microvessels To provide a global assessment of Hx- and H/R-induced changes in localization of the TJ transmembrane protein occludin, cerebral microvessels were isolated from Nx-, Hx-, and H/R-treated animals and analyzed by confocal microscopy following immunostaining for both occludin (using the Zymed 71-1500 polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminus of occludin; Fig. 1a–c ) and PECAM-1 ( Fig. 1a–c insets). Occludin staining in cerebral microvessels from Nx-treated animals showed a continuous, sharply defined pattern of a single line marking the paracellular clefts of adjacent PECAM-1 immunoreactive endothelial cells. Hx treatment greatly reduced occludin immunoreactivity within cerebral microvessels, promoting a loss of occludin staining from the paracellular clefts and the fragmenting of occludin staining along the length of the microvessel. H/R treatment increased occludin staining at the paracellular cleft compared with that observed following Hx treatment. Although H/R treatment re-established sharply defined paracellular occludin immunoreactivity along stretches of the microvessel, this was accompanied with the appearance of diffuse occludin immunoreactivity within (and also immediately beneath) the plasma membrane that was punctuated by sites of more intense staining ( Fig. 1c ). No change was observed in microvascular PECAM-1 staining during Hx or H/R.

Density gradient fractionation of cerebral microvessels To investigate on a molecular level, the effects of Hx and H/R on occludin oligomeric assemblies at TJs of the BBB, intact cerebral microvessels from Nx-, Hx-, and H/R-treated animals were fractionated by detergent-free OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation. This procedure separated ‘TJ-associated’ plasma membrane lipid rafts co-localizing with occludin multiprotein complexes from non-raft membranous structures and soluble cytoplasmic components ( Macdonald and Pike 2005 ; McCaffrey et al. 2007 , 2008 ). Fractionation of Nx-, Hx-, and H/R microvessel samples produced gradients with almost identical profiles for fraction density and protein content ( Fig. 2a ). Average fraction density (?) increased linearly from 1.042 g/mL (top of gradient) to 1.161 g/mL (bottom of gradient). Screening of density gradient fractions by SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis for Rab13 and caveolin-1 (previously shown to co-localize with ‘TJ-associated’ plasma membrane lipid rafts ( McCaffrey et al. 2007 , 2008 ), and nucleoporin (nuclear membrane marker) confirmed the separation of low density, plasma membrane lipid raft domains (fractions 5–10; ? = 1.067–1.111 g/mL) from higher density, and non-raft membranous structures (fractions 12–15; ? = 1.121–1.147 g/mL) ( Fig. 2b ). During steady-state (Nx), staining for Rab13 was restricted to fractions 7 and 8. Hx simultaneously promoted an increase of Rab13 staining in the lower density fractions 5 and 6, and a decrease in Rab13 staining in fractions 7 and 8. H/R reversed this trend, decreasing the amount of Rab13 staining in the lower density fractions and increasing the amount in fractions 7 and 8. Similar to Rab13, caveolin-1 staining was differentially modulated by Hx and H/R, with Hx inducing a decrease in association of this scaffolding protein with plasma membrane lipid rafts and H/R reversing this trend.

Screening of density gradient fractions by SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis for Rab13 and caveolin-1 (previously shown to co-localize with ‘TJ-associated’ plasma membrane lipid rafts ( McCaffrey et al. 2007 , 2008 ), and nucleoporin (nuclear membrane marker) confirmed the separation of low density, plasma membrane lipid raft domains (fractions 5–10; ? = 1.067–1.111 g/mL) from higher density, and non-raft membranous structures (fractions 12–15; ? = 1.121–1.147 g/mL) ( Fig. 2b ). During steady-state (Nx), staining for Rab13 was restricted to fractions 7 and 8. Hx simultaneously promoted an increase of Rab13 staining in the lower density fractions 5 and 6, and a decrease in Rab13 staining in fractions 7 and 8. H/R reversed this trend, decreasing the amount of Rab13 staining in the lower density fractions and increasing the amount in fractions 7 and 8. Similar to Rab13, caveolin-1 staining was differentially modulated by Hx and H/R, with Hx inducing a decrease in association of this scaffolding protein with plasma membrane lipid rafts and H/R reversing this trend.  PFO–PAGE of solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies Previously, our laboratory used subcellular fractionation and SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of isolated cerebral microvessels to identify the presence of oligomeric (>150 kDa), dimeric (~110–120 kDa), monomeric (53–65 kDa), and low molecular weight (LMW, 37–25 kDa) occludin isoforms within occludin oligomeric assemblies at TJs of the BBB. Treatment of density gradient fractions with the hydrophobic reducing agent 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) effectively reduced oligomeric and dimeric occludin isoforms to monomeric and LMW isoforms, confirming a role for hydrophobic disulfide bonds in formation of higher order occludin oligomeric structures ( McCaffrey et al. 2007 , 2008 ). In this study, to provide more detailed information about the structural integrity and molecular composition of raft-associated occludin oligomeric assemblies, density gradient fractions were first extracted with PFO, and then the PFO extracts were subjected to either non-reducing PFO–PAGE or non-reducing or reducing SDS–PAGE. Unlike the strongly ionic detergent SDS which breaks non-covalent interactions between proteins and promotes disassembly of multimeric proteins, PFO maintains hydrophobic interactions between subunits of multiprotein complexes and preserves the quaternary structure of multimeric proteins ( Ramjeesingh et al. 1999 ). The optimal concentration of PFO necessary to solubilize occludin was determined by control experiments using equal protein aliquots of microvessel homogenates in which increasing amounts of PFO were used to solubilize occludin. PFO extracts were subjected to reducing SDS–PAGE in the presence of TCEP, and the corresponding western blots were probed with the Zymed 71-1500 antibody to the C-terminus of occludin. As the concentration of PFO increased from 0.5% to 4%, the amount of occludin in the supernatant and corresponding pellet increased and decreased, respectively, and 2% PFO was found sufficient to solubilize all occludin present within microvessel homogenates (data not shown). Aliquots of density gradient fractions 5–10 (plasma membrane lipid rafts, ? = 1.067–1.111 g/mL) solubilized by 2% PFO were subjected to non-reducing PFO–PAGE ( Fig. 3a–c ) to provide confirmation of the solubilization of occludin as high molecular weight (>250 kDa) multiprotein occludin structures associated with plasma membrane lipid rafts. In Nx samples ( Fig. 3a ), occludin oligomeric assemblies were prominently detected in the low density fractions 7 and 8 (? = 1.081–1.100 g/mL) and to a lesser extent in the higher density fraction 10 (? = 1.111 g/mL). Density measurements of western blots revealed that Hx treatment promoted a dramatic reduction in the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies that could be detected in fraction 7 ( Fig. 3b ), the previously characterized low density ‘TJ-associated’ lipid raft domain ( McCaffrey et al. 2007 , 2008 ). H/R treatment increased the detectability of PFO-solubilized oligomeric occludin in fraction 7 ( Fig. 3c ). Hx treatment also decreased the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomer detectable in fraction 8, concomitantly increasing the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomer detectable in fractions 6, 9, and 10 ( Fig. 3b ). H/R treatment almost completely restored the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomer present in fraction 8 to its pre-Hx value ( Fig. 3c ).  PFO–PAGE of solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies Previously, our laboratory used subcellular fractionation and SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of isolated cerebral microvessels to identify the presence of oligomeric (>150 kDa), dimeric (~110–120 kDa), monomeric (53–65 kDa), and low molecular weight (LMW, 37–25 kDa) occludin isoforms within occludin oligomeric assemblies at TJs of the BBB. Treatment of density gradient fractions with the hydrophobic reducing agent 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) effectively reduced oligomeric and dimeric occludin isoforms to monomeric and LMW isoforms, confirming a role for hydrophobic disulfide bonds in formation of higher order occludin oligomeric structures ( McCaffrey et al. 2007 , 2008 ). In this study, to provide more detailed information about the structural integrity and molecular composition of raft-associated occludin oligomeric assemblies, density gradient fractions were first extracted with PFO, and then the PFO extracts were subjected to either non-reducing PFO–PAGE or non-reducing or reducing SDS–PAGE. Unlike the strongly ionic detergent SDS which breaks non-covalent interactions between proteins and promotes disassembly of multimeric proteins, PFO maintains hydrophobic interactions between subunits of multiprotein complexes and preserves the quaternary structure of multimeric proteins ( Ramjeesingh et al. 1999 ). The optimal concentration of PFO necessary to solubilize occludin was determined by control experiments using equal protein aliquots of microvessel homogenates in which increasing amounts of PFO were used to solubilize occludin. PFO extracts were subjected to reducing SDS–PAGE in the presence of TCEP, and the corresponding western blots were probed with the Zymed 71-1500 antibody to the C-terminus of occludin. As the concentration of PFO increased from 0.5% to 4%, the amount of occludin in the supernatant and corresponding pellet increased and decreased, respectively, and 2% PFO was found sufficient to solubilize all occludin present within microvessel homogenates (data not shown). Aliquots of density gradient fractions 5–10 (plasma membrane lipid rafts, ? = 1.067–1.111 g/mL) solubilized by 2% PFO were subjected to non-reducing PFO–PAGE ( Fig. 3a–c ) to provide confirmation of the solubilization of occludin as high molecular weight (>250 kDa) multiprotein occludin structures associated with plasma membrane lipid rafts. In Nx samples ( Fig. 3a ), occludin oligomeric assemblies were prominently detected in the low density fractions 7 and 8 (? = 1.081–1.100 g/mL) and to a lesser extent in the higher density fraction 10 (? = 1.111 g/mL). Density measurements of western blots revealed that Hx treatment promoted a dramatic reduction in the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies that could be detected in fraction 7 ( Fig. 3b ), the previously characterized low density ‘TJ-associated’ lipid raft domain ( McCaffrey et al. 2007 , 2008 ). H/R treatment increased the detectability of PFO-solubilized oligomeric occludin in fraction 7 ( Fig. 3c ). Hx treatment also decreased the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomer detectable in fraction 8, concomitantly increasing the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomer detectable in fractions 6, 9, and 10 ( Fig. 3b ). H/R treatment almost completely restored the amount of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomer present in fraction 8 to its pre-Hx value ( Fig. 3c ).  Non-reducing SDS–PAGE of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies To identify Hx- and H/R-induced changes in the type and relative amounts of monomeric occludin isoforms that were attached by non-covalent (hydrophobic) interactions to higher order occludin structures at the TJ and adjacent plasma membrane domains, aliquots of PFO extracts of density gradient fractions 5–10 (plasma membrane lipid rafts, ? = 1.067–1.111 g/mL) that were visualized by non-reducing PFO–PAGE ( Fig. 3a–c ) were heated for 10 min at 70°C in the presence of 2% SDS, and then subjected to non-reducing SDS–PAGE. The resultant western blots were probed with the Zymed 71-1500 antibody to the C-terminus of occludin ( Fig. 3d–f ). Multiple film exposures were taken for each set of blots (containing Nx, Hx, and H/R samples) to enhance detection of less-abundant occludin isoforms, and to ensure that for a particular occludin isoform, qualitative assessment of relative densities could be made within the linear range of the film. Western blots shown in Fig. 3d*–f* represent prolonged film exposures of western blots shown in Fig. 3d–f . Non-reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of PFO-solubilized occludin from Nx samples ( Fig. 3d ) showed that during steady-state, the bulk of detectable occludin was associated with the ‘TJ-associated’ fraction 7 (? = 1.081 g/mL) and the slightly higher density fraction 8 (? = 1.100 g/mL). Occludin oligomeric assemblies in fractions 7 and 8 were revealed to have appreciable amounts of dimeric (110 kDa) and monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms attached by SDS-sensitive (hydrophobic) interactions to higher order occludin structures. This finding was more evident in the prolonged film exposure shown in Fig. 3d* , which in addition revealed the presence in fraction 10 of dimeric (107 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms. To more readily discern relationships between oligomeric, dimeric, and monomeric occludin isoforms within either fraction 7 or 8, Fig. 3j was constructed to show western blots for each fraction separately aligned according to SDS–PAGE conditions (non-reducing and reducing) and treatment conditions (Nx, Hx, and H/R). In addition, Fig. 3k was prepared using enhanced film exposures of western blots of non-reducing SDS–PAGE for fractions 7 and 8 in which the oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms could more easily be detected. Taken together, Fig. 3d, 3d*, 3j and 3k show that the lower density, more tightly-packed ‘TJ-associated’ lipid rafts (fraction 7) not only had detectable amounts of both the ~290 and ~260 kDa occludin oligomeric isoforms, but also relatively higher oligomeric/dimeric and dimeric/monomeric occludin isoform ratios, than did the higher density, less tightly-packed lipid rafts (fraction 8). The amount of non-covalently bound, monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms present in the ‘TJ-associated’ fraction 7 was dramatically reduced by Hx treatment, and this was accompanied by a reduction in the ~290 kDa occludin isoform and an increase in the ~260 kDa occludin isoform ( Fig. 3e, 3e*, 3j, 3k ). Hx treatment also caused a discernible decrease in the amount of monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 8, and the additional appearance of occludin isoforms at 93 and 42 kDa ( Fig. 3e ), and at 37, 27, and 24 kDa ( Fig. 3e* ). Reduced staining of monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms in the lower density fractions 7 and 8 occurred simultaneously with marked increases in the amount of dimeric (107 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms detectable in the higher density fractions 9 and 10, and of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms visible in the lower density fraction 6 ( Fig. 3e* ). Western blots of non-reducing SDS–PAGE from H/R samples ( Fig. 3f, 3f* ) showed that H/R treatment dramatically restored the staining of monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms in the ‘TJ-associated’ fraction 7. Simultaneously, H/R increased the amount of these monomeric isoforms detected in fraction 8, and the amount of the 56 and 52 kDa monomeric isoforms in fractions 9 and 10. The amount of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 6 was reduced by H/R as was the visibility of the 37 kDa occludin isoform in fraction 8. The relative amounts of the presumed dimeric (107 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms in fractions 9 and 10 were altered such that, especially in fraction 9, a distinct decrease in the dimeric (107 kDa) occludin isoform coincided with a marked increase in the monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms.  Non-reducing SDS–PAGE of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies To identify Hx- and H/R-induced changes in the type and relative amounts of monomeric occludin isoforms that were attached by non-covalent (hydrophobic) interactions to higher order occludin structures at the TJ and adjacent plasma membrane domains, aliquots of PFO extracts of density gradient fractions 5–10 (plasma membrane lipid rafts, ? = 1.067–1.111 g/mL) that were visualized by non-reducing PFO–PAGE ( Fig. 3a–c ) were heated for 10 min at 70°C in the presence of 2% SDS, and then subjected to non-reducing SDS–PAGE. The resultant western blots were probed with the Zymed 71-1500 antibody to the C-terminus of occludin ( Fig. 3d–f ). Multiple film exposures were taken for each set of blots (containing Nx, Hx, and H/R samples) to enhance detection of less-abundant occludin isoforms, and to ensure that for a particular occludin isoform, qualitative assessment of relative densities could be made within the linear range of the film. Western blots shown in Fig. 3d*–f* represent prolonged film exposures of western blots shown in Fig. 3d–f . Non-reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of PFO-solubilized occludin from Nx samples ( Fig. 3d ) showed that during steady-state, the bulk of detectable occludin was associated with the ‘TJ-associated’ fraction 7 (? = 1.081 g/mL) and the slightly higher density fraction 8 (? = 1.100 g/mL). Occludin oligomeric assemblies in fractions 7 and 8 were revealed to have appreciable amounts of dimeric (110 kDa) and monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms attached by SDS-sensitive (hydrophobic) interactions to higher order occludin structures. This finding was more evident in the prolonged film exposure shown in Fig. 3d* , which in addition revealed the presence in fraction 10 of dimeric (107 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms. To more readily discern relationships between oligomeric, dimeric, and monomeric occludin isoforms within either fraction 7 or 8, Fig. 3j was constructed to show western blots for each fraction separately aligned according to SDS–PAGE conditions (non-reducing and reducing) and treatment conditions (Nx, Hx, and H/R). In addition, Fig. 3k was prepared using enhanced film exposures of western blots of non-reducing SDS–PAGE for fractions 7 and 8 in which the oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms could more easily be detected. Taken together, Fig. 3d, 3d*, 3j and 3k show that the lower density, more tightly-packed ‘TJ-associated’ lipid rafts (fraction 7) not only had detectable amounts of both the ~290 and ~260 kDa occludin oligomeric isoforms, but also relatively higher oligomeric/dimeric and dimeric/monomeric occludin isoform ratios, than did the higher density, less tightly-packed lipid rafts (fraction 8). The amount of non-covalently bound, monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms present in the ‘TJ-associated’ fraction 7 was dramatically reduced by Hx treatment, and this was accompanied by a reduction in the ~290 kDa occludin isoform and an increase in the ~260 kDa occludin isoform ( Fig. 3e, 3e*, 3j, 3k ). Hx treatment also caused a discernible decrease in the amount of monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 8, and the additional appearance of occludin isoforms at 93 and 42 kDa ( Fig. 3e ), and at 37, 27, and 24 kDa ( Fig. 3e* ). Reduced staining of monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms in the lower density fractions 7 and 8 occurred simultaneously with marked increases in the amount of dimeric (107 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms detectable in the higher density fractions 9 and 10, and of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms visible in the lower density fraction 6 ( Fig. 3e* ). Western blots of non-reducing SDS–PAGE from H/R samples ( Fig. 3f, 3f* ) showed that H/R treatment dramatically restored the staining of monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms in the ‘TJ-associated’ fraction 7. Simultaneously, H/R increased the amount of these monomeric isoforms detected in fraction 8, and the amount of the 56 and 52 kDa monomeric isoforms in fractions 9 and 10. The amount of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 6 was reduced by H/R as was the visibility of the 37 kDa occludin isoform in fraction 8. The relative amounts of the presumed dimeric (107 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms in fractions 9 and 10 were altered such that, especially in fraction 9, a distinct decrease in the dimeric (107 kDa) occludin isoform coincided with a marked increase in the monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms.  Reducing SDS–PAGE of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies To identify Hx- and H/R-induced changes in the type and relative amounts of occludin isoforms that were attached by covalent (disulfide bond) interactions to higher order occludin structures at the TJ, replicate aliquots of PFO extracts of density gradient fractions 5–10 were also heated for 10 min at 70°C in the presence of 2% SDS and the hydrophilic reducing agent TCEP, and then subjected to SDS–PAGE/western blot and probed with the Zymed 71-1500 antibody to the C-terminus of occludin ( Fig. 3g–i ). Western blots shown in Fig. 3g*–i* represent prolonged film exposures of western blots shown in Fig. 3g–i . Reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of PFO extracts from Nx samples (fraction 7, Fig. 3g ) revealed that exposure of ‘TJ-associated’ occludin oligomeric assemblies to the hydrophilic reducing agent TCEP markedly increased the detectability of the oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms ( Fig. 3g* and j ). In addition, TCEP reduction slightly increased the staining of the 55 and 51 kDa occludin isoforms (compare Fig. 3g* and d* ) and promoted the appearance of 93, 62, and 42 kDa occludin isoforms ( Fig. 3g* ). In contrast, TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies associated with higher density lipid rafts (fraction 10) reduced the staining for oligomeric (>250 kDa) occludin isoforms, increased staining for dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms, and induced the appearance of a 43 kDa occludin isoform ( Fig. 3g* ). Interestingly, following TCEP reduction, all dimeric occludin isoforms detected in fractions 7–10 appeared at the same molecular weight (110 kDa); monomeric (56, 52, and 43 kDa) occludin isoforms were detected only in fraction 10, and LMW (27 and 24 kDa) occludin isoforms were discernible only in fraction 8 ( Fig. 3g* ). Reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of ‘TJ-associated’ PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples emphatically increased the staining of monomeric (51 kDa) occludin isoforms (fraction 7, Fig. 3h ). Moreover, comparison of non-reducing (fraction 7, Fig. 3e* ) and reducing (fraction 7, Fig. 3h* ) western blots for TJ-associated’ PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples showed that exposure to TCEP enhanced staining for oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms as well as the staining for occludin isoforms of 93, 65, 62, and 42 kDa. In addition, staining of 55 and 51 kDa occludin isoforms was markedly increased. TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples also increased staining of oligomeric (~290 kDa) and dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 6 and allowed detection of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 5 ( Fig 3h* ). In contrast, TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples associated with relatively higher density lipid rafts (fractions 9 and 10) caused simultaneously reduced staining for oligomeric (>250 kDa) occludin isoforms, increased staining for dimeric (110 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms and the appearance of the 43 kDa occludin isoform ( Fig. 3e* and h* ). In fraction 8, comparison of non-reducing ( Fig. 3e ) and reducing ( Fig. 3h ) western blots for TJ-associated’ PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples showed that TCEP reduction not only markedly increased staining for the higher molecular weight oligomeric (~290 kDa) occludin isoform but also caused the disappearance of the dimeric (93 kDa) occludin isoform and the enhanced detection of the monomeric (55, 51, and 42 kDa) occludin isoforms. Moreover, comparison of band densities for monomeric (55, 51, and 42 kDa) occludin isoforms detected in non-reducing ( Fig. 3e and e* ) and reducing ( Fig. 3h and h* ) blots for fractions 7 and 8 showed that TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples produced distinctly different patterns for the ‘TJ-associated’ lipid rafts (fraction 7) and lipid rafts of a slightly higher density (fraction 8). Reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from H/R samples greatly increased staining for oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms in fractions 7 and 8 (compare Fig. 3f* and i* ). However, in comparison to Hx samples, in both fractions 7 and 8, staining for the ~290 occludin isoform was decreased, and staining for the ~260 kDa occludin isoform was increased ( Fig. 3j ). In addition, there was decreased staining of the ~290 kDa occludin isoform in the lower density fraction 6, and increased staining of higher molecular weight (>250 kDa) occludin isoforms in the higher density fractions 9 and 10 (compare Fig. 3h* and i* ). Detection of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms with lower density fractions 5 and 6 was also decreased by H/R, simultaneously with slight increases in detection of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in the higher density fractions 9 and 10 (compare Fig. 3h* and i* ). TCEP reduction increased staining in fractions 7 and 8 for monomeric (62, 55, 51, and 43 kDa) occludin isoforms, and staining in fractions 9 and 10 for monomeric (56, 52, and 43 kDa) occludin isoforms (compare Fig. 3f* and i* ). In addition, TCEP reduction increased staining in fraction 8 for LMW (37, 33, 27, and 24 kDa) occludin isoforms. Comparison of Fig. 3i* and h* showed that although H/R caused the disappearance of the 65 kDa occludin isoform, the staining for LMW (37, 33, 27, and 24 kDa) occludin isoforms was not altered.  Reducing SDS–PAGE of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies To identify Hx- and H/R-induced changes in the type and relative amounts of occludin isoforms that were attached by covalent (disulfide bond) interactions to higher order occludin structures at the TJ, replicate aliquots of PFO extracts of density gradient fractions 5–10 were also heated for 10 min at 70°C in the presence of 2% SDS and the hydrophilic reducing agent TCEP, and then subjected to SDS–PAGE/western blot and probed with the Zymed 71-1500 antibody to the C-terminus of occludin ( Fig. 3g–i ). Western blots shown in Fig. 3g*–i* represent prolonged film exposures of western blots shown in Fig. 3g–i . Reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of PFO extracts from Nx samples (fraction 7, Fig. 3g ) revealed that exposure of ‘TJ-associated’ occludin oligomeric assemblies to the hydrophilic reducing agent TCEP markedly increased the detectability of the oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms ( Fig. 3g* and j ). In addition, TCEP reduction slightly increased the staining of the 55 and 51 kDa occludin isoforms (compare Fig. 3g* and d* ) and promoted the appearance of 93, 62, and 42 kDa occludin isoforms ( Fig. 3g* ). In contrast, TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies associated with higher density lipid rafts (fraction 10) reduced the staining for oligomeric (>250 kDa) occludin isoforms, increased staining for dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms, and induced the appearance of a 43 kDa occludin isoform ( Fig. 3g* ). Interestingly, following TCEP reduction, all dimeric occludin isoforms detected in fractions 7–10 appeared at the same molecular weight (110 kDa); monomeric (56, 52, and 43 kDa) occludin isoforms were detected only in fraction 10, and LMW (27 and 24 kDa) occludin isoforms were discernible only in fraction 8 ( Fig. 3g* ). Reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of ‘TJ-associated’ PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples emphatically increased the staining of monomeric (51 kDa) occludin isoforms (fraction 7, Fig. 3h ). Moreover, comparison of non-reducing (fraction 7, Fig. 3e* ) and reducing (fraction 7, Fig. 3h* ) western blots for TJ-associated’ PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples showed that exposure to TCEP enhanced staining for oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms as well as the staining for occludin isoforms of 93, 65, 62, and 42 kDa. In addition, staining of 55 and 51 kDa occludin isoforms was markedly increased. TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples also increased staining of oligomeric (~290 kDa) and dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 6 and allowed detection of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in fraction 5 ( Fig 3h* ). In contrast, TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples associated with relatively higher density lipid rafts (fractions 9 and 10) caused simultaneously reduced staining for oligomeric (>250 kDa) occludin isoforms, increased staining for dimeric (110 kDa) and monomeric (56 and 52 kDa) occludin isoforms and the appearance of the 43 kDa occludin isoform ( Fig. 3e* and h* ). In fraction 8, comparison of non-reducing ( Fig. 3e ) and reducing ( Fig. 3h ) western blots for TJ-associated’ PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples showed that TCEP reduction not only markedly increased staining for the higher molecular weight oligomeric (~290 kDa) occludin isoform but also caused the disappearance of the dimeric (93 kDa) occludin isoform and the enhanced detection of the monomeric (55, 51, and 42 kDa) occludin isoforms. Moreover, comparison of band densities for monomeric (55, 51, and 42 kDa) occludin isoforms detected in non-reducing ( Fig. 3e and e* ) and reducing ( Fig. 3h and h* ) blots for fractions 7 and 8 showed that TCEP reduction of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Hx samples produced distinctly different patterns for the ‘TJ-associated’ lipid rafts (fraction 7) and lipid rafts of a slightly higher density (fraction 8). Reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from H/R samples greatly increased staining for oligomeric (~290 and ~260 kDa) occludin isoforms in fractions 7 and 8 (compare Fig. 3f* and i* ). However, in comparison to Hx samples, in both fractions 7 and 8, staining for the ~290 occludin isoform was decreased, and staining for the ~260 kDa occludin isoform was increased ( Fig. 3j ). In addition, there was decreased staining of the ~290 kDa occludin isoform in the lower density fraction 6, and increased staining of higher molecular weight (>250 kDa) occludin isoforms in the higher density fractions 9 and 10 (compare Fig. 3h* and i* ). Detection of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms with lower density fractions 5 and 6 was also decreased by H/R, simultaneously with slight increases in detection of dimeric (110 kDa) occludin isoforms in the higher density fractions 9 and 10 (compare Fig. 3h* and i* ). TCEP reduction increased staining in fractions 7 and 8 for monomeric (62, 55, 51, and 43 kDa) occludin isoforms, and staining in fractions 9 and 10 for monomeric (56, 52, and 43 kDa) occludin isoforms (compare Fig. 3f* and i* ). In addition, TCEP reduction increased staining in fraction 8 for LMW (37, 33, 27, and 24 kDa) occludin isoforms. Comparison of Fig. 3i* and h* showed that although H/R caused the disappearance of the 65 kDa occludin isoform, the staining for LMW (37, 33, 27, and 24 kDa) occludin isoforms was not altered.  Discussion In this study, we used a non-invasive in vivo rat model of global ischemia to investigate the sensitivity of occludin oligomeric assemblies at TJs of the BBB to acute changes in Hx. Intact cerebral microvessels obtained from animals subjected to either Nx (21% O2 for 60 min), Hx (6% O2 for 60 min), or H/R (6% O2 for 60 min followed by 21% O2 for 10) were fractionated by detergent-free, OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation in order to isolate plasma membrane lipid rafts from non-raft membranous structures and soluble cytoplasmic components. The structural integrity and isoform composition of raft-associated occludin oligomeric assemblies solubilized with PFO was examined by non-reducing and reducing SDS–PAGE. Our data showed for the first time that ‘TJ-associated’ occludin oligomeric assemblies responded to acute changes in oxygen availability with alterations in the type and extent of occludin isoforms attached by non-covalent (hydrophobic) and covalent (disulfide bond) interactions. Stroke-related brain damage and mortality is a major health concern worldwide ( Donnan et al. 2008 ). Changes in paracellular permeability during the ischemic (hypoxic) and reperfusion (reoxygenation) phases of stroke directly promotes the cerebral edema that leads to increased intracranial pressure and death ( Petty and Lo 2002 ; Sandoval and Witt 2008 ). Molecular understanding of the mechanism of TJ dysfunction at the BBB during Hx and post-hypoxic reoxygenation is a research priority in the identification of targets suitable for therapeutic manipulation to prevent increases in paracellular permeability and the development of cerebral edema ( Neuwelt et al. 2008 ). To investigate the effect of Hx and H/R on paracellular permeability at the BBB, our laboratory has established an in vivo rat model of global H/R in which anesthetized animals were first subjected for 1 h to an acute, moderate hypoxic stress (inhaled 6% O2), and then exposed for various periods of time to normal atmospheric conditions (21% O2). In situ brain perfusion studies demonstrated a biphasic response to H/R, with significant increases in the uptake of [14C]sucrose into brain parenchyma occurring at 10 min and 6–18 h post-H/R ( Witt et al. 2003 ). Additional capillary depletion, cerebral blood flow, and brain water content (cerebral edema) analyses indicated that the increased BBB permeability was because of increased paracellular diffusion (i.e., leak) through the TJ ( Witt et al. 2003 , 2008 ), and western blot analyses of microvessel homogenates showed altered expression of the TJ transmembrane protein occludin ( Witt et al. 2003 ). In the present study, we used our in vivo model of global Hx and reoxygenation model, combined with confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation of isolated cerebral microvessels, to further investigate the response of occludin to acute changes in oxygen availability. Blood gas and electrolyte analysis ( Table 1 ) performed immediately following the treatment of anesthetized animals with either Nx (21% O2 for 60 min), Hx (6% O2 for 60 min), or H/R (6% O2 for 60 min followed by 21% O2 for 10 min) confirmed that animals in this study subjected to an acute, moderate-to-severe hypoxic insult showed a classic acute respiratory response to oxygen deprivation, responding in a similar manner to those in previous studies in which in situ brain perfusion studies and cerebral edema measurements revealed significant TJ dysfunction at the BBB ( Witt et al. 2003 , 2008 ). Global assessment of occludin localization within microvascular endothelial cells at the BBB in Nx-, Hx-, and H/R-treated animals using confocal microscopy of isolated cerebral microvessels probed with the Zymed 71-1500 polyclonal antibody to the C-terminus of occludin ( Fig. 1 ) demonstrated that a unique pattern for occludin immunostaining was associated with each treatment. Whereas a clearly-defined, continuous pattern of occludin immunostaining was observed in cerebral microvessels isolated from Nx-treated animals, Hx treatment greatly reduced occludin immunoreactivity to the extent that it was only weakly present in an ill-defined, fragmented fashion along the length of the microvessel. H/R treatment promoted a dramatic increase in microvascular occludin immunoreactivity, causing the reappearance of extended regions of sharply defined paracellular occludin immunoreactivity and, in addition, the irregular appearance of isolated spots of relatively more intense occludin immunoreactivity within regions of the plasma membrane and directly adjacent cytoplasm. Taken together, blood chemistry and confocal microscopy data demonstrated that Nx, Hx, and H/R represent three distinct physiological states, each of which exhibited a unique pattern of occludin localization within endothelial microvessels. Our finding of decreased occludin staining at the endothelial cell plasma membrane during hypoxic stress was in agreement with previous reports of decreased microvascular endothelial occludin immunoreactivity following hypoxic stress ( Mark and Davis 2002 ; Brown and Davis 2005 ; Date et al. 2006 ; Wang et al. 2007 ; Bangsow et al. 2008 ). Recently, we have characterized a neutral pH, detergent-free, isosmotic OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation method to fractionate intact cerebral microvessels so as to separate low density plasma membrane lipid rafts from higher density non-raft plasma membrane domains and subcellular membranous components. Absence of detergent in this fractionation procedure enabled the isolation of TJ-associated occludin within the context of its normal plasma membrane lipid raft environment. Western blots of density gradient fractions (subjected to reducing SDS–PAGE with a hydrophilic reducing agent) when probed for occludin using an antibody directed to the C-terminus, revealed a complex distribution profile within microvascular endothelial plasma membrane lipid rafts of different density of oligomeric, dimeric, monomeric, and LMW occludin isoforms ranging in molecular weight from approximately 25 to 300 kDa. Use of the strong hydrophobic reducing agent EDT during SDS–PAGE was shown to significantly reduce oligomeric (>250 kDa) and dimeric (~100–120 kDa) occludin isoforms and simultaneously increase the amount of monomeric isoforms. By so doing, EDT reduction revealed the importance of disulfide bonds within hydrophobic regions of occludin in the maintenance of higher order occludin structures ( McCaffrey et al. 2007 ). In a follow-up study, density gradient fractionation of isolated cerebral microvessels, combined with both reducing and non-reducing SDS– PAGE/western blot analysis, showed the stress of 3 h of peripheral inflammatory hyperalgesia provoked a disruption of disulfide-bonded occludin oligomeric assemblies and a redistribution of occludin isoforms within lipid raft domains of different density ( McCaffrey et al. 2008 ). In the current study, following density gradient fractionation of isolated cerebral microvessels to isolate plasma membrane lipid rafts, we investigated if intact occludin oligomeric assemblies could be solubilized from lipid rafts with PFO. PFO is a mild ionic detergent that has been used to solubilize multimeric protein complexes of human ATP-binding cassette G2 ( Xu et al. 2004 ), vanilloid receptor 1 ( Kedei et al. 2001 ), and the TJ transmembrane protein claudin-4 ( Mitic et al. 2003 ). Effective solubilization of occludin was achieved with 2% PFO, and PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies were visualized exclusively as high molecular weight (>250 kDa) structures by non-reducing PFO–PAGE/western blot (using the Zymed 71-1500 C-terminal occludin antibody). Non-reducing PFO–PAGE of PFO extracts showed that the distribution of occludin among plasma membrane lipid rafts (density gradient fractions 5–10; ? = 1.067–1.111 g/mL) was differentially modulated by Nx, Hx, and H/R ( Fig. 3a–c ). During steady-state (Nx), the majority of oligomeric occludin was associated with plasma membrane lipid rafts of density ? = 1.081–1.100 g/mL (fractions 7 and 8; Fig. 3a ). This finding was in agreement with density gradient fraction screening ( Fig. 2b ) which showed a similar concentration within fractions 7 and 8 of the intact TJ markers, Rab13 and oligomeric caveolin-1. Similar to confocal microscopy data ( Fig. 1 ), Hx caused a dramatic reduction of ‘TJ-associated’ PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies ( Fig. 3b ), and H/R substantially (but not completely) reversed this ( Fig. 3c ). Evidence that staining for Rab13 and caveolin-1 within fractions 7 and 8 was decreased by Hx and increased by H/R ( Fig. 2b ) provided corroboration that during these two physiological states there was differential remodeling of low density plasma membrane lipid rafts associated with TJs. The rapid reappearance of occludin immunoreactivity following H/R treatment ( Figs. 1 and 3c ), which differed from Hx treatment by the addition of only 10 min of ambient air, cannot be accounted for by de novo occludin synthesis. Consequently, decreased occludin staining in Hx samples is not believed the result of significant in situ proteolysis. Because the intensity of protein staining in western blot analysis is directly proportional to the extent of antigen binding by the probing antibody, decreased occludin immunoreactivity may reflect either a loss of protein or a change in protein conformation which effectively masks antigenic sites. To begin to address this issue, we used non-reducing and reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of PFO-solubilized occludin to examine the effect of Hx and H/R on the extent and type of occludin isoforms bound to higher order structures by non-covalent (hydrophobic) and covalent (disulfide bond) interactions. PFO extracts of density gradient fractions 5–10 from Nx samples, upon being analyzed by either non-reducing ( Fig. 3d and d* ) or reducing ( Fig. 3g and g* ) SDS–PAGE, revealed that PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies associated with plasma membrane lipid rafts of different densities were differently sensitive to SDS and SDS + TCEP because unique profiles for occludin isoforms ranging in molecular weight from 24 to ~290 kDa were observed. Hx and H/R differentially altered the profiles of non-covalent and covalently bound occludin isoforms for different plasma membrane lipid raft domains ( Fig. 3h, i, h* and i* ). Comprehensive analysis of non-reducing and reducing SDS–PAGE/western blot data enabled us to hypothesize that occludin oligomeric assemblies at TJs of the BBB contained both an inner core of covalently attached occludin subunits (>250 kDa) and an outer shell of non-covalently attached occludin subunits (ranging in molecular weight from 24 to 110 kDa) ( Fig. 4 ). Focusing on ‘TJ-associated’ occludin oligomeric assemblies (fraction 7, ? = 1.081–1.100 g/mL), our data revealed the presence of a core oligomeric structure comprised two major components at ~260 and ~290 kDa that was remarkably resistant to disruption by not only SDS or SDS + TCEP, but also Hx- and H/R stress. Evidence of this structural resilience was seen in the comparatively slight changes in staining intensities for oligomeric occludin (in either non-reducing or reducing SDS–PAGE) in Nx, Hx, and H/R samples. Occludin oligomeric structural stability was also affirmed by the fact that exposure of PFO-solubilized oligomeric occludin assemblies to SDS + TCEP caused a marked increase (not decrease) in immunoreactivity at the same molecular weights (~290 and ~260 kDa), which revealed that although conformational changes were induced (involving reduction of component disulfide bonds) which unmasked antigenic sites within the C-terminus of occludin, the integrity of the high molecular weight structures was not impaired to the extent that the overall complex was forcibly collapsed into LMW subunits. In contrast to oligomeric occludin isoform staining, dramatic changes in staining of non-covalently bound monomeric isoforms was caused not only by SDS and SDS + TCEP, but also by Hx and H/R. Comparison of non-reducing ( Fig. 3d and d* ) and reducing ( Fig. 3g and g* ) SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of ‘TJ-associated’ PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies from Nx samples showed that whereas a subset of non-covalently bound dimeric (110 kDa) and monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms could readily be disassociated from higher order structures by SDS, another subset of dimeric (110 and 93 kDa) and monomeric (62, 55, 51, and 42 kDa) occludin isoforms attached by covalent (hydrophobic) interactions could be removed by SDS + TCEP. Comparison of non-reducing SDS–PAGE of ‘TJ-associated’ PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies (Fraction 7) from Hx ( Fig. 3e and e* ) and H/R ( Fig. 3f and f* ) samples dramatically revealed that Hx and H/R caused the apparent disappearance and reappearance, respectively, of a subset of monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin isoforms attached by non-covalent (hydrophobic) interactions. Assuming that this subset of non-covalently bound occludin monomeric subunits had C-termini that was not involved in coiled coil and/or disulfide bridge interactions and therefore accessible to a C-terminal occludin antibody during western blot analysis, their absence (during Hx) may contribute to diminished occludin immunoreactivity at the TJ. Accessibility of the C-termini of this subset of non-covalently bound monomeric occludin subunits to interaction with specific regulatory and/or signaling molecules could also lead to changes in post-translational modification (such as phosphorylation) that result in conformational changes and reassociation with plasma membrane lipid rafts of higher density. Comparison of profiles for monomeric occludin isoforms in fractions 7–10 in non-reducing SDS–PAGE ( Fig. 3e and e* ) showed that a decrease in staining for 55 and 51 kDa occludin isoforms in the lower density fractions 7 and 8 occurred simultaneously with an increase in staining for 56 and 52 kDa occludin isoforms in the higher density fractions 9 and 10. Taken together, these data suggested that during Hx there occurred conformational changes and/or disulfide bond disruptions in the underlying structural core of oligomeric occludin subunits (evidenced by increased immunoreactivity of oligomeric occludin), and post-translational modifications of non-covalently attached 55 and 51 kDa monomeric occludin subunits (e.g., phosphorylation), the end result of which there was a reassociation of modified occludin subunits to higher density plasma membrane lipid raft domains. In addition, removal of an outer shell of closely attached monomeric occludin subunits appeared to increase the vulnerability of the occludin oligomeric assembly to SDS + TCEP, because the latter was able to disassociate a comparatively greater amount of monomeric (65, 62, 55, 51, and 42 kDa) occludin isoforms (compare Fig. 3g*/3d* with Fig. 3h* and e* ). Similar to SDS + TCEP, H/R induced disulfide bond breakage within ‘TJ-associated’ occludin oligomeric assemblies, resulting in the generation of additional non-covalently attached monomeric (55 and 51 kDa) occludin subunits that could enable enhanced occludin immunoreactivity (during western blot analysis) and interact with additional regulatory/signaling molecules to intensify occludin signaling pathways. In summary, we used density gradient fractionation of isolated cerebral microvessels, combined with PFO- and SDS–PAGE/western blot analysis of PFO-solubilized occludin oligomeric assemblies to investigate if acute changes in oxygen availability (i.e., Hx) affect occludin oligomeric assemblies at TJs of the BBB. Our data confirm that each physiological state or stressor (Nx, Hx, and H/R) differentially affects the organization of occludin isoforms within plasma membrane lipid rafts of different densities. ‘TJ-associated’ occludin oligomeric assemblies were revealed to contain a backbone core of high molecular weight, disulfide-bonded units (believed to be engaged in a structural role) that is adorned with a variety of non-covalently attached, LMW occludin isoforms which has C-termini that is readily accessible to interact with regulatory and/or signaling molecules. These exciting data which supported a model for ‘TJ-associated’ occludin oligomeric assemblies that incorporates both stable and mobile elements were in agreement with a recent assessment of TJ protein dynamics using live-cell imaging in epithelial cells which showed that approximately 70% of occludin diffused rapidly within the TJ during steady-state ( Shen et al. 2008 ). Future studies involving detailed investigation of the effect of hypoxic and reoxygenation stress on protein–protein interactions of particular occludin isoforms will reveal how different signaling and regulatory molecules modulate occludin oligomeric assemblies to promote changes in TJ integrity at the BBB.  Discussion In this study, we used a non-invasive in vivo rat model of global ischemia to investigate the sensitivity of occludin oligomeric assemblies at TJs of the BBB to acute changes in Hx. Intact cerebral microvessels obtained from animals subjected to either Nx (21% O2 for 60 min), Hx (6% O2 for 60 min), or H/R (6% O2 for 60 min followed by 21% O2 for 10) were fractionated by detergent-free, OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation in order to isolate plasma membrane lipid rafts from non-raft membranous structures and soluble cytoplasmic components. The structural integrity and isoform composition of raft-associated occludin oligomeric assemblies solubilized with PFO was examined by non-reducing and reducing SDS–PAGE. Our data showed for the first time that ‘TJ-associated’ occludin oligomeric assemblies responded to acute changes in oxygen availability with alterations in the type and extent of occludin isoforms attached by non-covalent (hydrophobic) and covalent (disulfide bond) interactions. Stroke-related brain damage and mortality is a major health concern worldwide ( Donnan et al. 2008 ).
