Amyloid goes global The brains of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients contain abundant amyloid plaques composed of A? peptides. It is generally assumed that amyloid plaques and soluble A? oligomers induce neuronal pathology in AD. The mechanism of amyloid-mediated pathological effects is not clearly understood. Recent in vivo calcium (Ca2+) imaging studies with AD mouse models provide novel insights into changes in brain function resulting from accumulation of amyloid plaques. The unexpected lesson from these studies is that amyloid plaques result in both localized and global changes in brain function. The amyloid-induced effects include “short-range” changes in neuronal Ca2+ levels, “medium-range” changes in neuronal activity and ‘long-range” changes in astrocytic Ca2+ signaling and induction of intracellular Ca2+ waves spreading via astrocytic network. These results have potential implications for understanding synaptic and neuronal network dysfunction in AD brains.
