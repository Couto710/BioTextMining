Does “Asymptomatic” Mean Without Symptoms for Those Living with HIV Infection? Throughout the history of the HIV epidemic, HIV-positive patients with relatively high CD4 counts and no clinical features of opportunistic infections have been classified as “asymptomatic” by definition and treatment guidelines. This classification, however, does not take into consideration the array of symptoms that an HIV-positive person can experience long before progressing to AIDS. This short report describes two international multi-site studies conducted in 2003–2005 and 2005–2007. Results from the studies show that HIV-positive people may experience symptoms throughout the trajectory of their disease, regardless of CD4 count or classification. Providers should discuss symptoms and symptom management with their clients at all stages of the disease.  METHODS This study is a secondary analysis of two studies conducted under the auspices of the UCSF International Nursing Network for HIV/AIDS Research ( www.ucsf.edu/aidsnursing ) ( Table 1 ). The first study, “Self-Care Symptom Management in HIV/AIDS” (Study A) ( Reynolds et al., 2007 ) was a descriptive cross-sectional study examining self-reported symptoms and self-care behaviors in 1,217 HIV-infected men and women from Colombia, Norway, Puerto Rico, Taiwan and the United States. The second study, “The Efficacy of the HIV/AIDS Symptom Management Manual” (Study B) ( Wantland et al., in press ), was a three-month, repeated measures randomized controlled trial of 775 participants in Kenya, Puerto Rico, South Africa, and the United States. Only the baseline data are used in this analysis.  INSTRUMENTS A Demographic Survey booklet was used to collect information on personal and environmental characteristics (eg. age, gender, whether participants had adequate income). Data on biological/physiological factors (eg. whether participants had received an AIDS diagnosis, had comorbidities) were also collected. The Revised Sign and Symptom Checklist for Persons with HIV Disease (SSC-HIVrev) ( Holzemer, Hudson, Kirksey, Hamilton, & Bakken, 2001 ) was used to capture the frequency and intensity of 72 common HIV signs and symptoms experienced by the participant on the day the checklist is completed. Items were rated on a 3-point Likert scale of 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe). Reliability and validity of the instrument have been previously reported for a U.S. sample ( Holzemer et al., 2001 ). A Chinese version has been tested with a Taiwanese sample ( Tsai, Hsiung, & Holzemer, 2003 ). Slightly different Spanish versions were used in Texas, Puerto Rico, and Colombia. In Africa, the English version was used. Researchers at each site confirmed the content validity of the versions.  DATA ANALYSIS Responses to the questionnaires were entered into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows Version 13.0 software ( SPSS, 2005 ). Descriptive statistics (i.e., means, standard deviations, frequencies, and percents) were used to examine demographic characteristics of the samples and the frequency and intensity of the symptoms. For the purposes of this analysis, gynecological signs and symptoms were excluded. The individuals’ self-reported CD4 values were stratified into three groups: 0–200, 201–350 and >350 CD4 cells/mm3. In Study A, 26.8% of reporting participants had CD4 counts of 0–200 cells/mm3; 19.5% had counts of 201–350 cells/mm3; and 53.7% had counts greater than 350 cells/mm3. In Study B, 24.7% had CD4 counts of 0–200 cells/mm3; 21.1% had counts of 201–350 cells/mm3; and 54.1% had counts greater than 350 cells/mm3. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) compared the mean number and intensity of symptoms reported by the three groups, controlling for taking ARV medications at the time of the survey.  FINDINGS Symptom Rankings In both studies, the most frequently reported symptoms included both physical and psychosocial symptoms: fatigue, depression, and muscle aches. Table 2 shows the ranking of the twenty most frequently reported symptoms for both studies, with a frequency range of 33% to 60%. Symptoms by CD4 Category For Study A, the mean self-reported CD4 count was 433 (SD=413) and the average symptom frequency was 18.3 (SD=16.8) ( Table 3 ). The mean number of symptoms by CD4 category was: 0–200 cells/mm3 = 19.9 (SD=17.5); 201–350 cells/mm3 = 17.5 (SD=15.6); and >350 cells/mm3 = 17.9 (SD=16.9). Of those reporting (n=820), 21.3% (n=175) were not taking ARV medications. No differences were noted as to whether or not the participant was taking ARV medications and the frequency or intensity of symptoms reported. ANCOVA revealed a nonsignificant main effect of CD4 category on the frequency of reported symptoms (F(2,820)=2.43, p = 0.12). There were no differences in the number of symptoms among the three levels of CD4 counts. There was a significant lower report of symptom intensity for those presently taking ARVs compared to those not taking ARVs (F(1,718)=7.42, p=0.007), however similar to symptom frequency, there was no significant difference between the CD4 categories in either ARV group (F(2,718)=0.44, p=0.64). For Study B, the mean self-reported CD4 count was 407 (SD=268) and the average symptom frequency was 20.9 (SD=18.3). The mean number of symptoms by CD4 category was: 0–200 cells/mm3 = 21.0 (SD=17.7); 201–350 cells/mm3 = 21.7 (SD=20.3); and >350 cells/mm3 = 20.4 (SD=17.8). Of those reporting, (n=477), 27.6% (n=132) were not taking ARV medications. Again, there was no effect on whether or not the participant was taking ARV medications and the frequency of symptoms reported. ANCOVA revealed a nonsignificant main effect of CD4 category on the frequency of reported symptoms (F(2,479)=0.20, p = 0.82). There were no differences in the number of symptoms among the three levels of CD4 counts. The interaction between taking/not taking ARV medications and CD4 category was not significant with similar results (F(2,479)=0.46, p=0.63). In Study B, there was also no significant difference in the report of symptom intensity for those presently taking ARVs compared to those not taking ARVs and, similar to Study A, there was no significant difference between the CD4 categories in either ARV group (F(2,448)=0.47, p=0.62). Results from both studies show that the symptom frequency and intensity for those taking ARV medications and those not taking ARVs were similar by CD4 category ( Table 3 ). Intensity of symptoms in both studies demonstrates a wide SD. This indicates a broad variation in how patients perceive and rate their symptom experience.

DISCUSSION The data from these studies demonstrate that the term “asymptomatic” HIV disease is not a valid term, as patients do experience symptoms regardless of their CD4 count or lack of OIs. The data also reveal that self-reported symptoms are present in individuals regardless of whether they are taking ARVs. Clearly, there are symptoms associated with all levels of CD4 classification. Based on developments in HIV treatment and care, and the findings reported here, the authors recommend that clinicians no longer use the term “asymptomatic” to define their HIV-positive clients’ treatment needs. Clinicians should carefully interview patients as to the presence of symptoms regardless of CD4 count and should address symptom management. The wide variability of symptoms’ intensity lends credence to further interview of the patients to explore their illness experience and seek methods to improve quality of life. The danger of labeling someone living with HIV infection as “asymptomatic” is the failure to recognize the constellation of symptoms they are experiencing, on or off ARVs, across the spectrum of CD4 counts. Clinical practice guidelines have been shown to be an effective means of improving the way clinicians manage patients, and it is important for HIV clinical practice guidelines to reflect the fact that HIV-positive people may experience symptoms throughout their disease, and that these must be managed to improve quality of life.
