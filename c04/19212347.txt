ETS genetic rearrangements do not initiate cancer in the prostate  Methods Mice (B6J background strain) expressing ERG under the control of the probasin (ARR2-PB) promoter were generated, genotyped, and examined for transgene expression by qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. We generated and analyzed 3 independent ERG lines. Founders were subsequently bred and 4 mice of each genotype were euthanized at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 18 months of age. Prostate tissues were procured for formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, and frozen storage for future molecular analyses.  Figure Figure 1 Prostate specific over-expression of ERG does not induce high grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia A total of 24 wild-type and 24 ERG transgenic mice were phenotypically characterized from one founding line after establishment that three independent founding lines produced a similar phenotype (A). Low (100X) and high (400X) power representative sections are shown for mice 6 months of age (ventral, anterior, and dorsal-lateral prostate lobes) demonstrating prominent nucleoli in wild-type mouse prostate glands. Representative histology of human high grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and HGPIN in Pten heterozygous mice at 12 months of age (B). Immunohistochemical staining for Ki67 demonstrated no difference between wild-type mice and ERG transgenic mice (C).
