Development and use of DNA archives at veterinary teaching hospitals to investigate the genetic basis of disease in dogs  Conclusions The DNA archives developed at veterinary medical teaching hospitals will be important resources for mapping disease loci and identifying underlying genes. The most important feature of a DNA archive is accurate identification or exclusion of the disease or diseases of each animal. Such archives will be complementary resources to tissue banks h already available to researchers studying the genetic basis of disease in animals and can make a unique contribution to investigators conducting association studies in animals.  Figures Figure 1 Flow diagram illustrating possible paths from a phenotype for an inherited trait or disease to discovery of a gene or genes underlying the condition and the main features of the process. *Mendelian traits - for diseases attributable to an autosomal recessive trait, 20 to 30 affected animals and 20 to 30 unaffected animals are needed. For diseases attributable to a dominant trait, 30 to 40 affected animals and 30 to 40 unaffected animals are needed. †Complex traits - at extreme distributions for unrelated animals, 100 affected animals and 100 unaffected animals are needed. For pedigrees, 200 to 400 (or more) animals are empirically needed. ‡For this step, 20 to 30 affected animals and 20 to 30 unaffected animals for each breed are needed. §An alternative is to analyze genome-wide expression (by use of microarrays) and consider each expression level as a QTL. Figure 2 Graphs of power analysis as a function of sample size for the detection of disease loci for a Mendelian recessive trait (A) or a multigenic trait (B). The analyses were conducted for r 2 values of 0.5 (dotted lines), 0.65 (dashed lines) and 0.8 (dotted and dashed lines); the r 2 value is a measure of LD. For each analysis, the number of case and control animals was equal.
