Tailoring to RB: tumour suppressor status and therapeutic response The retinoblastoma tumour suppressor (RB) is a crucial regulator of cell-cycle progression that is invoked in response to a myriad of anti-mitogenic signals. It has been hypothesized that perturbations of the RB pathway confer a synonymous proliferative advantage to tumour cells; however, recent findings demonstrate context-specific outcomes associated with such lesions. Particularly, loss of RB function is associated with differential response to wide-ranging therapeutic agents. Thus, the status of this tumour suppressor may be particularly informative in directing treatment regimens.
