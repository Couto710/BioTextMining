Non-nucleoside inhibitors of the hepatitis C virus NS5B RNA-dependant RNA polymerase: 2-Aryl-3-heteroaryl-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA polymerase is crucial for replicating the HCV RNA genome and is an attractive target for developing anti-HCV drugs. A novel series of 2,3-diaryl-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives were evaluated for their ability to inhibit HCV NS5B. Of this series, compounds 4c, 5b, 5c and 6 emerged as more potent, displaying over 95% inhibition of NS5B RNA polymerase activity in vitro . The two most active compounds 4c and 5c exhibited an IC50 of 31.9 µM and 32.2 µM, respectively against HCV NS5B.
