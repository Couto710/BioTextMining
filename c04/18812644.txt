A Surgical Device for Radiofrequency Ablation of Large Liver Tumours Radiofrequency ablation has become an accepted treatment option of patients with primary and metastatic liver tumours. We propose an ablation electrode array consisting of 4–8 blade shaped electrodes arrangend in a circular geometry for the treatment of large liver tumours. We developed a 3D code based on the finite difference method to evaluate the effect of diFferent numbers of electrodes (4, 6 and 8) and electrode distance on lesion size. The configuration with six electrodes can ablate a volume of 70 × 70 × 40 mm3 in approximately 5 minutes, with tissue temperature above 50 °C throughout the treatment volume. We then performed an experimental study in polyacrylamide gel in order to validate the theoretical results. The average temperature error between the simulation and the experiment was 3.8% at the center of the electrode array. This study shows that the proposed device potencially allows more rapid treatment of large tumours compared to current radiofrequency ablation devices.
