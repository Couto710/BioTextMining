Activation Induced Deaminase is required for the chromosomal breaks in c-myc that lead to c-myc/IgH translocations Chromosomal translocation requires formation of paired double strand DNA breaks (DSBs) on heterologous chromosomes. One of the most well characterized oncogenic translocations juxtaposes c-myc and the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus ( IgH ) and is found in Burkitt’s lymphomas in humans and plasmacytomas in mice. DNA breaks in IgH leading to c-myc/IgH translocations are created by activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) during antibody class switch recombination or somatic hypermutation. However, the source of DNA breaks at c-myc is not known. Here we provide evidence for the c-myc promoter region being required in targeting AID-mediated DNA damage to produce DSBs in c-myc that lead to c-myc/IgH translocations in primary B lymphocytes. Thus, in addition to producing somatic mutations and DNA breaks in antibody genes, AID is also responsible for the DNA lesions in oncogenes that are required for their translocation.  Introduction Chromosome translocations have been proposed to require formation of pairs of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and trans-chromosomal ligation of the broken ends ( Richardson and Jasin, 2000 ). Among somatic cells, mature B lymphocytes are particularly prone to DSB formation in Ig loci during antibody gene diversification reactions and to malignant transformation by Ig translocation ( Adams et al., 1983 ; Adams et al., 1982 ; Adams et al., 1985 ; Cory et al., 1983 ; Crews et al., 1982 ; Dalla-Favera et al., 1983 ; Erikson et al., 1983 ; Hamlyn and Rabbitts, 1983 ; Jankovic et al., 2007 ; Kuppers and Dalla-Favera, 2001 ; Leder et al., 1983 ; Marcu et al., 1983 ; Stanton et al., 1983 ; Taub et al., 1982 ). Two different reactions diversify antibody genes in mature B cells: class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM). CSR involves deletion of DNA sequences and replacement of one antibody constant region for another while retaining the specificity of the antigen receptor ( Chaudhuri et al., 2007 ; Stavnezer et al., 2008 ). In contrast, SHM introduces non-templated nucleotide changes in antibody variable region genes, producing variants with differing affinity for antigen ( Di Noia and Neuberger, 2007 ; Peled et al., 2008 ). Although these reactions are very different, they are both initiated by AID, an enzyme that is expressed primarily in germinal center B cells ( Muramatsu et al., 2000 ; Muramatsu et al., 1999 ; Revy et al., 2000 ). The same enzyme is also essential for c-myc/IgH translocations in primary B cells and mouse plasmacytomas ( Kovalchuk et al., 2007 ; Potter, 2003 ; Ramiro et al., 2006 ; Ramiro et al., 2004 ; Takizawa et al., 2008 ). AID initiates CSR and SHM by deaminating cytosine residues in single stranded DNA, which is exposed during transcription ( Bransteitter et al., 2003 ; Chaudhuri et al., 2003 ; Di Noia and Neuberger, 2002 ; Dickerson et al., 2003 ; Imai et al., 2003 ; Petersen-Mahrt et al., 2002 ; Pham et al., 2003 ; Rada et al., 2002 ; Ramiro et al., 2003 ). The resulting U:G mismatch is recognized by either uracyl DNA glycosylase or mismatch repair proteins and processed by one of several DNA repair pathways to produce point mutations in variable regions or a combination of mutations and DSBs in switch regions ( Di Noia and Neuberger, 2007 ; Peled et al., 2008 ; Stavnezer et al., 2008 ). AID introduces multiple DSBs in switch regions during CSR as evidenced by internal deletions ( Dudley et al., 2002 ; Nagaoka et al., 2002 ; Petersen et al., 2001 ; Reina-San-Martin et al., 2003 ) and accumulation of foci of DNA repair factors at the IgH locus preceding CSR ( Petersen et al., 2001 ; Reina-San-Martin et al., 2004 ). Deletions and duplications are less frequent in Ig variable regions accounting for 5% of all hypermutations ( Goossens et al., 1998 ; Wilson et al., 1998 ). C-myc translocates to both Ig variable and switch regions and in both cases the translocations are AID dependent ( Dorsett et al., 2007 ; Ramiro et al., 2004 ). In addition to targeting Ig loci, AID also produces mutations in a number of other genes including oncogenes ( Gordon et al., 2003 ; Liu et al., 2008 ; Muschen et al., 2000 ; Pasqualucci et al., 1998 ; Pasqualucci et al., 2001 ; Shen et al., 1998 ). However, mutations in c-myc are either absent ( Pasqualucci et al., 2001 ; Shen et al., 1998 ), or occur at a rate that is several orders of magnitude lower than in IgH ( Liu et al., 2008 ). In addition the available sequence analysis shows no evidence of AID dependent deletions or duplications in c-myc or other oncogenes that might suggest AID dependent DSB formation ( Gordon et al., 2003 ; Liu et al., 2008 ; Mullighan et al., 2007 ; Muschen et al., 2000 ; Pasqualucci et al., 1998 ; Pasqualucci et al., 2001 ; Shen et al., 1998 ). Furthermore, AID induced lesions in genes other than antibody genes appear to be repaired by a pathway that is distinct from and less error prone than lesions in IgH ( Liu et al., 2008 ). Indeed, when DSBs have been detected in c-myc in human B cells they have been found to be AID independent ( Zan et al., 2003 ). One potential source for the DSBs in c-myc is fragile DNA segments that are prone to form non-B-DNA configurations including Z-DNA, triple helical H-DNA, and G-quadruplex DNA (reviewed in ( Liu and Levens, 2006 ; Marcu et al., 1992 ; Spencer and Groudine, 1991 ; Wierstra and Alves, 2008 )). These sequences are particularly susceptible to AID independent DNA damage and DSB formation during transcription or replication, but also in response to environmental agents and metabolic stress and they have been implicated as a source of the DSBs in c-myc that lead to translocation (reviewed in ( Reddy and Vasquez, 2005 )). Here we report on experiments that examine the role of the c-myc promoter and AID in producing the lesions in c-myc that lead to c-myc/IgH translocations in mature B cells in vivo .  Experimental Procedures Mice Myc?/+, IgHI/+, MycI/+, and AIDCre/+ mice were generated by homologous recombination in C57BL/6 albino ES cells. Details of the targeting vectors, screening by Southern Blot and genotyping PCR are provided in the legends to the Supplemental Figures . AID?/? mice ( Muramatsu et al., 2000 ) were backcrossed to C57BL/6 for at least 10 generations. All experiments were in agreement with protocols approved by the Rockefeller University and NIH Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Retroviruses Cre, I-SceI, I-SceI*, and AID were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pMX-IRES-GFP plasmid. In I-SceI*, D44A and D145A substitutions to inactivate the catalytic sites were introduced by PCR ( Stoddard, 2005 ). B cell cultures and retroviral transduction Resting B lymphocytes were isolated from mouse spleens by immunomagnetic depletion with anti-CD43 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotech), and cultured at 0.5×106 cells/ml in R10 medium: RPMI supplemented with L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, antibiotic/antimycotic, 50?M 2-mercaptoethanol (all from GIBCO-BRL), and 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone). B cells were stimulated in the presence of 25 ?g/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS, E. coli serotype 0111:B4, Sigma) and 5 ng/ml mouse recombinant IL-4 (Sigma), and analyzed after 96 hours. For the analysis of translocations in Myc?/+ mice ( Figure 1D ) cultures were supplemented with 50ng/ml mouse recombinant BAFF (R&D Systems) to boost the translocation frequency. For infection experiments, retroviral supernatants were prepared by co-transfecting BOSC23 cells with pCL-Eco and pMX-IRES-GFP-derived plasmids (encoding for Cre, I-SceI, I-SceI*, or AID) using Fugene 6, 72 hours before infection. At 20 and 44 hours of lymphocyte culture, retroviral supernatants were added and B cells spinoculated at 1150g for 1.5 hours in the presence of 10?g/ml polybrene. After 4 hours at 37C, supernatants were replaced with LPS and IL4 supplemented R10. B cells were analyzed at 96 hours from the beginning of their culture. Flow cytometry and cell sorting For FACS analysis, spleen cell suspensions were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD19, anti-CD3, anti-IgM, anti-IgD, and anti-IgG1 (Pharmingen). CFSE-labeling for cell division was at 37C for 10 min in 5?M carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl esther. In all experiments, retrovirally infected GFP+ cells were sorted to >95% purity with a FACSVantage SE or FACSAria instruments (Becton Dickinson). RNA fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (RNA FISH) Stimulated splenic B cells were fixed on slides and analyzed by RNA FISH as described ( Gribnau et al., 1998 ; Gribnau et al., 2000 ; Chakalova et al., 2004 ). Immuno-FISH Immunocytochemistry staining followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (Immuno-FISH) was as described ( Petersen et al., 2001 ; Difilippantonio et al., 2000 ). PCR assay for translocations PCR reactions were performed on genomic DNA from 105 cells, unless otherwise indicated. Using Expand Long Template PCR System nested reactions were performed with the following primers: for derivative chromosome 12 translocations first round, 5-TGAGGACCAGAGAGGGATAAAAGAGAA-3 and 5-GGGGAGGGGGTGTCAAATAATAAGA-3; for derivative chromosome 12 translocations second round, 5-CACCCTGCTATTTCCTTGTTGCTAC-3 and 5-GACACCTCCCTTCTACACTCTAAACCG-3; for derivative chromosome 15 translocations first round, 5-ACTATGCTATGGACTACTGGGGTCAAG-3 and 5-GTGAAAACCGACTGTGGCCCTGGAA-3; for derivative chromosome 15 translocations second round, 5-CCTCAGTCACCGTCTCCTCAGGTA-3 and 5-GTGGAGGTGTATGGGGTGTAGAC-3; for derivative chromosome 12 translocations (upstream of switch ?) first round, 5-GGCAACTTCAAATTCATTAAACCACAT-3 and 5-GGGGAGGGGGTGTCAAATAATAAGA-3; for derivative chromosome 12 translocations (upstream of switch ?) second round, 5-AAATGTGAGTGACCCAGACA ACG-3 and 5-GACACCTCCCTTCTACACTCTAAACCG-3; PCR conditions were according to manufacturer instructions with 29 cycles for the first round (10 cycles at 92C, 10 s; 60C, 30 s; and 68C, 7 min; followed by 19 cycles at 92C, 15 s; 60C, 30 s; and 68C, 7 min with 20 s of additional extension time per cycle) and 25 cycles for the second round (10 cycles at 92C, 10 s; 60C, 30 s; and 68C, 4 min; followed by 15 cycles at 92C, 15 s; 60C, 30 s; and 68C, 4 min with 20 s of additional extension time per cycle). PCR products were gel-purified and sequenced. Southern Blotting Southern blot analysis was performed as described ( Ramiro et al., 2006 ). Oligoprobes were: for der15 c-myc 5-GCCGCCACTTTACTGGACTGCGCAGG-3; for der15 IgH 5-GAGGGAGCCGGCTGAGAGAAGTTGGG-3; for der12 c-myc 5-GCAGCGATTCAGCACTGGGTGCAGG-3; for der12 IgH (3? of switch ?) 5-CCTGGTATACAGGACGAAACTGCAGCAG-3; for der12 IgH (5? of switch ?) 5-TTCAGTCATTGCTTTAGGGGGAG-3. P value was calculated using the 2-Tail Fisher’s exact test. Mutational analysis Primers 5-TGGTCTTTCCCTGTGTTCTTTCTG-3 and 5-GACACCTCCCTTCTACACTCTAAACCG-3 were used to amplify a portion of c-myc intron 1 with Pfu polymerase and 25 cycles of amplification (95C, 10 s; 58C, 30 s; and 72C, 90 s), prior to cloning in TOPO vector and sequencing.

Results c-myc is transcribed from several promoters distributed in a region surrounding the non-coding first exon of the gene ( Wierstra and Alves, 2008 ). To determine whether c-myc transcription is required for translocation to IgH , we used homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to delete a 2.2 Kbps genomic fragment that includes the region corresponding to c-myc promoters P0, P1 and P2 ( Figure 1A , and Supplemental Figure S1 ). Myc?/+ mice were born at nearly Mendelian ratio ( Figure 1B ) and B cell development and activation in response to mitogenic stimuli were unaltered in heterozygous mice ( Supplemental Figure S1 ). To examine the transcriptional status of the Myc? allele we performed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Osborne et al., 2007 ). Among the Myc+/+ B cells with transcriptionally active alleles (n=168), 76% had one active c-myc allele and 24% had two active alleles. In striking contrast, 97% of the transcriptionally active Myc?/+ B cells (n=86) had one silent allele, demonstrating that only one of the two alleles was efficiently transcribed in mutant mice ( Figure 1C ). Consistent with the reported lethality of c-myc deletion ( Davis et al., 1993 ), the Myc? mutation resulted in intercrosses between Myc?/+ that failed to produce any Myc?/? homozygous mutants ( Figure 1B ). We conclude that c-myc transcription is severely impaired by the Myc? mutation. To examine the effects of the Myc? mutation on c-myc/IgH translocations we assayed for these events in heterozygous Myc?/+ B cells stimulated with LPS and IL-4, using a previously described PCR assay to detect both derivative 12 and 15 chromosomes ( Figure 1D and Supplemental Figure S2 ). Translocations were detected in Myc?/+ mice, but sequence analysis revealed that 22 of 23 of these were IgH fusions to the wild type Myc+ allele ( Figure 1D ). Thus, the Myc? mutation drastically reduces c-myc ’s propensity to undergo oncogenic chromosomal translocations to IgH . <italic>c-myc/IgH</italic> translocations induced by Cre The IgH locus on mouse chromosome 12 and the c-myc locus on chromosome 15 co-localize in transcription factories in activated B lymphocytes, and this physical proximity has been proposed to facilitate c-myc/IgH translocations ( Osborne et al., 2007 ; Parada et al., 2004 ; Roix et al., 2003 ). To determine whether the Myc? allele was accessible for translocation we made use of the phage-derived Cre-loxP recombinase system ( Van Duyne, 2001 ). Cre recognizes 34 nucleotide loxP sites and catalyzes DNA recombination between two such sites. Recombination requires that Cre gain access to the DNA target and the efficiency of the reaction is inversely proportional to the distance between loxP sites ( Yu and Bradley, 2001 ). To test for Cre mediated translocations between the loxP site on the Myc? allele and IgH we introduced a single loxP site into IgH, upstream of the switch ? region (IgHI/+ mice, Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure S3 ). As a control for the Myc? allele we also introduced a single loxP site into the first intron of intact c-myc (MycI/+ mice, Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure S4 ). IgHI/+ and MycI/+ mice showed normal B lymphocyte development and switching in response to LPS and IL-4 stimulation ( Supplemental Figure S3, S4 and data not shown). Compound heterozygous B cells bearing either Myc? or MycI and IgHI (Myc?/IgHI and MycI/IgHI respectively) were tested for Cre mediated translocations using a retrovirus expressing Cre. By semi-quantitative analysis, we found that the frequency of c-myc/IgH translocations in Myc?/IgHI and MycI/IgHI B cells expressing Cre was indistinguishable (0.5×10?5 for der12) ( Figure 2B ). To examine the nature of Cre mediated interchromosomal junctions we sequenced 8 candidate translocations. Irrespective of whether the translocations originated from Myc?/IgHI or MycI/IgHI B cells, the breakpoints were always precisely at the loxP site. To corroborate these results in the absence of retroviral Cre over-expression, we crossed the Myc?/IgHI and MycI/IgHI mice to mice where Cre expression is under the control of regulatory elements of aicda (AIDCre/+, Supplemental Figure S5 ). Cre-mediated translocations were readily detected in both Myc?/IgHI/AIDCre and MycI/IgHI/AIDCre B lymphocytes upon mitogenic stimulation in vitro and even in Peyer’s Patches in vivo ( Figures 2C and Supplemental Figure S6 ). Thus, Cre rescues translocation of the mutant Myc? allele in activated B cells in vitro and in vivo . We conclude that both the active (MycI) and silent (Myc?)alleles reside in Cre-accessible nuclear compartments and remain in sufficient spatial proximity to IgH to permit translocation irrespective of c-myc ’s transcriptional status. DSBs in <italic>c-myc</italic> catalyzed by I-SceI AID induced DSBs along the IgH locus can be detected by combining immunocytochemistry to detect accumulation of 53BP1 foci, and fluorescence in situ hybridization to localize IgH ( Figure 3 and ( Reina-San-Martin et al., 2004 )). Background levels of co-localization of 53BP1 foci and IgH were found in AID deficient B cells, and the frequency increased to 42.5% in AID sufficient B cells ( Figure 3A and ( Reina-San-Martin et al., 2004 )). In contrast, when we examined c-myc by the same technique we found no AID dependent increase in 53BP1 foci during CSR ( Figure 3A ). Retroviral over-expression of AID did however result in DNA damage at c-myc, as determined by increased co-localization of 53BP1 foci (12.2% vs. 4.3% with control, p = 0.007; Figure 3B ) and accumulation of mutations in intron 1 (1.2 × 10?4 vs. <0.07×10?4 with control, p = 0.0005; Supplemental Table 1 ). Thus, our immuno-FISH experiments are in agreement with the sequencing data and fail to show evidence for AID induced DNA damage on c-myc during CSR under physiologic circumstances ( Liu et al., 2008 ; Pasqualucci et al., 2001 ; Shen et al., 1998 ). However, c-myc can be an AID target when AID is over-expressed. To examine the consequence of DSB formation at c-myc , we used the yeast derived I-SceI endonuclease, which recognizes an 18 bps site that is otherwise absent from the mouse genome (reviewed in ( Stoddard, 2005 )). DNA breaks were created in the presence or absence of AID using I-SceI to cut at cognate target sites introduced into the MycI and IgHI alleles ( Figure 2A and Supplemental Figures S3 and S4 ). Similar to AID induced DNA damage, retroviral expression of I-SceI in activated MycI/+AID?/? or IgHI/+AID?/? B lymphocytes produced frequent DSBs in c-myc or IgH respectively. As determined by immuno-FISH, 30.8% of MycI/+ B cells expressing I-SceI showed co-localization of c-myc and 53BP1 and 21.9% of IgHI/+ B cells exhibited c-myc/53BP1 co-localization ( Figure 3C ). Control B lymphocytes infected with a catalytically inactive form of I-SceI (I-SceI*) showed background levels of DNA damage at c-myc or IgH ( Figure 3C ). We conclude that I-SceI efficiently targets MycI/+ and IgHI/+ in activated B cells. <italic>c-myc/IgH</italic> translocations catalyzed by I-SceI To determine whether DSBs produced by I-SceI can serve as substrates for c-myc/IgH translocation we assayed for these events in LPS and IL-4 stimulated MycI/+IgHI/+AID?/?B cells expressing I-SceI or I-SceI* ( Figure 4 ). Whereas we found no translocation with the retrovirus alone or I-SceI*, I-SceI expression produced der15 translocations at a rate of 10×10?5 ( Figures 4B , 6 , Supplemental Figures S7, S10 and data not shown; Note: while we assayed both der12 and der15 translocations, the close proximity of the binding sites of the der12 primers to the I-SceI sequences and processing of the DNA ends, see below, appears to result in the underestimation of their frequency). Thus, DSBs introduced by I-SceI in c-myc and IgH result in c-myc/IgH transchromosomal rearrangements. Translocation breakpoints were found precisely at the I-SceI site and also at distances of up to 2178 bps from the site of the DSB ( Figure 4C , and Supplemental Table 2 ). The average distance of the breakpoint position from the I-SceI site on c-myc was 50 bps for der12 and 1744 bps for der15, and for IgH it was 39 bps for der12 and 91 bps ( Supplemental Table 2 ). Out of 21 translocation junctions, 19 involved 1–7 bps of microhomology (average microhomology of 2.9 bps) and 2 of them included insertions ( Figure 5 and Supplemental Table 2 ). We conclude that repair of I-SceI breaks frequently involves processing of the ends and microhomology mediated joining. Source of DSB in <italic>c-myc</italic> during <italic>c-myc/IgH</italic> translocation To determine if I-SceI breaks can be joined to AID induced lesions we examined MycI/+ B cells infected with I-SceI or I-SceI* encoding retroviruses. Baseline levels of AID mediated translocation were enhanced by I-SceI cutting in MycI/+ B cells (for der15 I-SceI*: 0.2×10?5 vs. I-SceI: 0.8×10?5, p = 0.0002; Figure 5B and Supplemental Figure S8 ). Consistent with this enhancement, 15 of 17 translocations produced in MycI/+ B cells infected with I-SceI were MycI to IgH translocations, while only 2 involved the wild type Myc+ allele ( Supplemental Table 3 ). Whereas the breakpoints for c-myc/IgH translocations cloned from wild type control B cells were spread over 1.4 Kbps surrounding the first exon of c-myc , 10/15 I-SceI induced MycI breakpoints were found precisely at the I-SceI site and the remainder mapped within 74 bps of the site ( Figure 5C and Supplemental Table 3 ). In contrast to the breakpoints produced by joining two I-SceI sites in the absence of AID ( Figure 4C , Supplemental Table 2 ), 7 of the junctions between an I-SceI DSB in c-myc and an AID lesion in IgH were blunt, 2 had an insertion, and the remaining 6 showed 1–3 bps of microhomology (overall average microhomology: 0.8 bps; Figure 5D , Supplemental Table 2 ). A similar relationship between direct versus microhomology mediated joins is found in c-myc/IgH translocations in wild type B cells ( Figure 5D and Supplemental Table 4 ) and in physiological CSR, where 30–60% of the joints are blunt and the remainder use 1–4 bps of microhomology (reviewed in ( Chaudhuri et al., 2007 ; Stavnezer et al., 2008 )). Whereas I-SceI induced DSBs in c-myc enhanced translocation frequency ( Figure 5B ), we found no difference in translocation frequency between IgHI/+ B cells infected with I-SceI or I-SceI* (for der15 0.14×10?5 vs. 0.2×10?5 respectively; Supplemental Figure S9 ). The breakpoint was at the I-SceI cognate site in 2 out of 4 translocations involving the IgHI allele, confirming that similar to MycI, IgHI was also substrate for I-SceI cleavage and recombination ( Supplemental Figure S9 ). Therefore, although I-SceI generates DSBs at c-myc and IgH with comparable efficiency ( Figure 3C ), it enhances the frequency of c-myc/IgH translocation in MycI/+ but not IgHI/+ B cells. We conclude that I-SceI induced breaks in c-myc or IgH can be joined to AID produced breaks in IgH or c-myc, respectively, to create c-myc/IgH translocations. In addition, we find that DSBs in c-myc but not IgH are limiting for translocation since a single I-SceI break in c-myc but not IgH enhances translocation. To determine whether the source of the DSB alters the frequency of translocation we compared the incidence of c-myc/IgH transchromosomal rearrangements in MycI/+IgHI/+AID?/? B cells infected with AID or I-SceI or Cre expressing retroviruses. We found that the rate of translocation was similar for all three DNA damage-inducing enzymes (for der15 5×10?5 for AID, 10×10?5 for I-SceI and 3×10?5 for Cre, Figure 6 and Supplemental Figure S10 ). We conclude that the rate of c-myc/IgH translocation is similar irrespective of whether the DSBs are induced by AID, I-SceI or Cre. To determine whether AID is essential to create the breaks in c-myc that lead to c-myc/IgH translocation we induced DSBs in the IgH locus of IgHI/+AID?/? or the c-myc locus of MycI/+AID?/? B cells using I-SceI. In contrast to IgHI/+MycI/+AID?/? B cells ( Figure 4 ), and to AID sufficient MycI/+ and IgHI/+ B cells ( Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure S9 ), I-SceI induced DSBs in either c-myc or IgH alone, in MycI/+AID?/? or IgHI/+AID?/? B cells respectively, failed to produce c-myc/IgH translocations ( Figure 7 ). Thus, when I-SceI alone or I-SceI and AID coordinately generate DSBs on both chromosomes they result in c-myc/IgH translocations. In contrast, in the absence of AID, I-SceI-induced DSBs generated solely at IgH or c-myc do not produce translocations. We conclude that AID is essential for the DSBs in both of the chromosomes involved in c-myc/IgH translocation.  Results c-myc is transcribed from several promoters distributed in a region surrounding the non-coding first exon of the gene ( Wierstra and Alves, 2008 ). To determine whether c-myc transcription is required for translocation to IgH , we used homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to delete a 2.2 Kbps genomic fragment that includes the region corresponding to c-myc promoters P0, P1 and P2 ( Figure 1A , and Supplemental Figure S1 ). Myc?/+ mice were born at nearly Mendelian ratio ( Figure 1B ) and B cell development and activation in response to mitogenic stimuli were unaltered in heterozygous mice ( Supplemental Figure S1 ). To examine the transcriptional status of the Myc? allele we performed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Osborne et al., 2007 ). Among the Myc+/+ B cells with transcriptionally active alleles (n=168), 76% had one active c-myc allele and 24% had two active alleles. In striking contrast, 97% of the transcriptionally active Myc?/+ B cells (n=86) had one silent allele, demonstrating that only one of the two alleles was efficiently transcribed in mutant mice ( Figure 1C ). Consistent with the reported lethality of c-myc deletion ( Davis et al., 1993 ), the Myc? mutation resulted in intercrosses between Myc?/+ that failed to produce any Myc?/? homozygous mutants ( Figure 1B ). We conclude that c-myc transcription is severely impaired by the Myc? mutation. To examine the effects of the Myc? mutation on c-myc/IgH translocations we assayed for these events in heterozygous Myc?/+ B cells stimulated with LPS and IL-4, using a previously described PCR assay to detect both derivative 12 and 15 chromosomes ( Figure 1D and Supplemental Figure S2 ). Translocations were detected in Myc?/+ mice, but sequence analysis revealed that 22 of 23 of these were IgH fusions to the wild type Myc+ allele ( Figure 1D ). Thus, the Myc? mutation drastically reduces c-myc ’s propensity to undergo oncogenic chromosomal translocations to IgH . <italic>c-myc/IgH</italic> translocations induced by Cre The IgH locus on mouse chromosome 12 and the c-myc locus on chromosome 15 co-localize in transcription factories in activated B lymphocytes, and this physical proximity has been proposed to facilitate c-myc/IgH translocations ( Osborne et al., 2007 ; Parada et al., 2004 ; Roix et al., 2003 ). To determine whether the Myc? allele was accessible for translocation we made use of the phage-derived Cre-loxP recombinase system ( Van Duyne, 2001 ). Cre recognizes 34 nucleotide loxP sites and catalyzes DNA recombination between two such sites. Recombination requires that Cre gain access to the DNA target and the efficiency of the reaction is inversely proportional to the distance between loxP sites ( Yu and Bradley, 2001 ). To test for Cre mediated translocations between the loxP site on the Myc? allele and IgH we introduced a single loxP site into IgH, upstream of the switch ? region (IgHI/+ mice, Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure S3 ). As a control for the Myc? allele we also introduced a single loxP site into the first intron of intact c-myc (MycI/+ mice, Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure S4 ). IgHI/+ and MycI/+ mice showed normal B lymphocyte development and switching in response to LPS and IL-4 stimulation ( Supplemental Figure S3, S4 and data not shown). Compound heterozygous B cells bearing either Myc? or MycI and IgHI (Myc?/IgHI and MycI/IgHI respectively) were tested for Cre mediated translocations using a retrovirus expressing Cre. By semi-quantitative analysis, we found that the frequency of c-myc/IgH translocations in Myc?/IgHI and MycI/IgHI B cells expressing Cre was indistinguishable (0.5×10?5 for der12) ( Figure 2B ). To examine the nature of Cre mediated interchromosomal junctions we sequenced 8 candidate translocations. Irrespective of whether the translocations originated from Myc?/IgHI or MycI/IgHI B cells, the breakpoints were always precisely at the loxP site. To corroborate these results in the absence of retroviral Cre over-expression, we crossed the Myc?/IgHI and MycI/IgHI mice to mice where Cre expression is under the control of regulatory elements of aicda (AIDCre/+, Supplemental Figure S5 ). Cre-mediated translocations were readily detected in both Myc?/IgHI/AIDCre and MycI/IgHI/AIDCre B lymphocytes upon mitogenic stimulation in vitro and even in Peyer’s Patches in vivo ( Figures 2C and Supplemental Figure S6 ). Thus, Cre rescues translocation of the mutant Myc? allele in activated B cells in vitro and in vivo . We conclude that both the active (MycI) and silent (Myc?)alleles reside in Cre-accessible nuclear compartments and remain in sufficient spatial proximity to IgH to permit translocation irrespective of c-myc ’s transcriptional status. DSBs in <italic>c-myc</italic> catalyzed by I-SceI AID induced DSBs along the IgH locus can be detected by combining immunocytochemistry to detect accumulation of 53BP1 foci, and fluorescence in situ hybridization to localize IgH ( Figure 3 and ( Reina-San-Martin et al., 2004 )). Background levels of co-localization of 53BP1 foci and IgH were found in AID deficient B cells, and the frequency increased to 42.5% in AID sufficient B cells ( Figure 3A and ( Reina-San-Martin et al., 2004 )).

Control B lymphocytes infected with a catalytically inactive form of I-SceI (I-SceI*) showed background levels of DNA damage at c-myc or IgH ( Figure 3C ).

Background levels of co-localization of 53BP1 foci and IgH were found in AID deficient B cells, and the frequency increased to 42.5% in AID sufficient B cells ( Figure 3A and ( Reina-San-Martin et al., 2004 )). In contrast, when we examined c-myc by the same technique we found no AID dependent increase in 53BP1 foci during CSR ( Figure 3A ). Retroviral over-expression of AID did however result in DNA damage at c-myc, as determined by increased co-localization of 53BP1 foci (12.2% vs. 4.3% with control, p = 0.007; Figure 3B ) and accumulation of mutations in intron 1 (1.2 × 10?4 vs. <0.07×10?4 with control, p = 0.0005; Supplemental Table 1 ). Thus, our immuno-FISH experiments are in agreement with the sequencing data and fail to show evidence for AID induced DNA damage on c-myc during CSR under physiologic circumstances ( Liu et al., 2008 ; Pasqualucci et al., 2001 ; Shen et al., 1998 ).

To examine the consequence of DSB formation at c-myc , we used the yeast derived I-SceI endonuclease, which recognizes an 18 bps site that is otherwise absent from the mouse genome (reviewed in ( Stoddard, 2005 )). DNA breaks were created in the presence or absence of AID using I-SceI to cut at cognate target sites introduced into the MycI and IgHI alleles ( Figure 2A and Supplemental Figures S3 and S4 ). Similar to AID induced DNA damage, retroviral expression of I-SceI in activated MycI/+AID?/? or IgHI/+AID?/? B lymphocytes produced frequent DSBs in c-myc or IgH respectively. As determined by immuno-FISH, 30.8% of MycI/+ B cells expressing I-SceI showed co-localization of c-myc and 53BP1 and 21.9% of IgHI/+ B cells exhibited c-myc/53BP1 co-localization ( Figure 3C ). Control B lymphocytes infected with a catalytically inactive form of I-SceI (I-SceI*) showed background levels of DNA damage at c-myc or IgH ( Figure 3C ). We conclude that I-SceI efficiently targets MycI/+ and IgHI/+ in activated B cells.

In contrast, when we examined c-myc by the same technique we found no AID dependent increase in 53BP1 foci during CSR ( Figure 3A ). Retroviral over-expression of AID did however result in DNA damage at c-myc, as determined by increased co-localization of 53BP1 foci (12.2% vs. 4.3% with control, p = 0.007; Figure 3B ) and accumulation of mutations in intron 1 (1.2 × 10?4 vs. <0.07×10?4 with control, p = 0.0005; Supplemental Table 1 ). Thus, our immuno-FISH experiments are in agreement with the sequencing data and fail to show evidence for AID induced DNA damage on c-myc during CSR under physiologic circumstances ( Liu et al., 2008 ; Pasqualucci et al., 2001 ; Shen et al., 1998 ). However, c-myc can be an AID target when AID is over-expressed. To examine the consequence of DSB formation at c-myc , we used the yeast derived I-SceI endonuclease, which recognizes an 18 bps site that is otherwise absent from the mouse genome (reviewed in ( Stoddard, 2005 )). DNA breaks were created in the presence or absence of AID using I-SceI to cut at cognate target sites introduced into the MycI and IgHI alleles ( Figure 2A and Supplemental Figures S3 and S4 ). Similar to AID induced DNA damage, retroviral expression of I-SceI in activated MycI/+AID?/? or IgHI/+AID?/? B lymphocytes produced frequent DSBs in c-myc or IgH respectively. As determined by immuno-FISH, 30.8% of MycI/+ B cells expressing I-SceI showed co-localization of c-myc and 53BP1 and 21.9% of IgHI/+ B cells exhibited c-myc/53BP1 co-localization ( Figure 3C ). Control B lymphocytes infected with a catalytically inactive form of I-SceI (I-SceI*) showed background levels of DNA damage at c-myc or IgH ( Figure 3C ). We conclude that I-SceI efficiently targets MycI/+ and IgHI/+ in activated B cells.  <italic>c-myc/IgH</italic> translocations catalyzed by I-SceI To determine whether DSBs produced by I-SceI can serve as substrates for c-myc/IgH translocation we assayed for these events in LPS and IL-4 stimulated MycI/+IgHI/+AID?/?B cells expressing I-SceI or I-SceI* ( Figure 4 ). Whereas we found no translocation with the retrovirus alone or I-SceI*, I-SceI expression produced der15 translocations at a rate of 10×10?5 ( Figures 4B , 6 , Supplemental Figures S7, S10 and data not shown; Note: while we assayed both der12 and der15 translocations, the close proximity of the binding sites of the der12 primers to the I-SceI sequences and processing of the DNA ends, see below, appears to result in the underestimation of their frequency). Thus, DSBs introduced by I-SceI in c-myc and IgH result in c-myc/IgH transchromosomal rearrangements. Translocation breakpoints were found precisely at the I-SceI site and also at distances of up to 2178 bps from the site of the DSB ( Figure 4C , and Supplemental Table 2 ). The average distance of the breakpoint position from the I-SceI site on c-myc was 50 bps for der12 and 1744 bps for der15, and for IgH it was 39 bps for der12 and 91 bps ( Supplemental Table 2 ). Out of 21 translocation junctions, 19 involved 1–7 bps of microhomology (average microhomology of 2.9 bps) and 2 of them included insertions ( Figure 5 and Supplemental Table 2 ). We conclude that repair of I-SceI breaks frequently involves processing of the ends and microhomology mediated joining.  <italic>c-myc/IgH</italic> translocations catalyzed by I-SceI To determine whether DSBs produced by I-SceI can serve as substrates for c-myc/IgH translocation we assayed for these events in LPS and IL-4 stimulated MycI/+IgHI/+AID?/?B cells expressing I-SceI or I-SceI* ( Figure 4 ).

We conclude that repair of I-SceI breaks frequently involves processing of the ends and microhomology mediated joining.  Source of DSB in <italic>c-myc</italic> during <italic>c-myc/IgH</italic> translocation To determine if I-SceI breaks can be joined to AID induced lesions we examined MycI/+ B cells infected with I-SceI or I-SceI* encoding retroviruses. Baseline levels of AID mediated translocation were enhanced by I-SceI cutting in MycI/+ B cells (for der15 I-SceI*: 0.2×10?5 vs. I-SceI: 0.8×10?5, p = 0.0002; Figure 5B and Supplemental Figure S8 ). Consistent with this enhancement, 15 of 17 translocations produced in MycI/+ B cells infected with I-SceI were MycI to IgH translocations, while only 2 involved the wild type Myc+ allele ( Supplemental Table 3 ). Whereas the breakpoints for c-myc/IgH translocations cloned from wild type control B cells were spread over 1.4 Kbps surrounding the first exon of c-myc , 10/15 I-SceI induced MycI breakpoints were found precisely at the I-SceI site and the remainder mapped within 74 bps of the site ( Figure 5C and Supplemental Table 3 ). In contrast to the breakpoints produced by joining two I-SceI sites in the absence of AID ( Figure 4C , Supplemental Table 2 ), 7 of the junctions between an I-SceI DSB in c-myc and an AID lesion in IgH were blunt, 2 had an insertion, and the remaining 6 showed 1–3 bps of microhomology (overall average microhomology: 0.8 bps; Figure 5D , Supplemental Table 2 ). A similar relationship between direct versus microhomology mediated joins is found in c-myc/IgH translocations in wild type B cells ( Figure 5D and Supplemental Table 4 ) and in physiological CSR, where 30–60% of the joints are blunt and the remainder use 1–4 bps of microhomology (reviewed in ( Chaudhuri et al., 2007 ; Stavnezer et al., 2008 )). Whereas I-SceI induced DSBs in c-myc enhanced translocation frequency ( Figure 5B ), we found no difference in translocation frequency between IgHI/+ B cells infected with I-SceI or I-SceI* (for der15 0.14×10?5 vs. 0.2×10?5 respectively; Supplemental Figure S9 ). The breakpoint was at the I-SceI cognate site in 2 out of 4 translocations involving the IgHI allele, confirming that similar to MycI, IgHI was also substrate for I-SceI cleavage and recombination ( Supplemental Figure S9 ). Therefore, although I-SceI generates DSBs at c-myc and IgH with comparable efficiency ( Figure 3C ), it enhances the frequency of c-myc/IgH translocation in MycI/+ but not IgHI/+ B cells. We conclude that I-SceI induced breaks in c-myc or IgH can be joined to AID produced breaks in IgH or c-myc, respectively, to create c-myc/IgH translocations. In addition, we find that DSBs in c-myc but not IgH are limiting for translocation since a single I-SceI break in c-myc but not IgH enhances translocation. To determine whether the source of the DSB alters the frequency of translocation we compared the incidence of c-myc/IgH transchromosomal rearrangements in MycI/+IgHI/+AID?/? B cells infected with AID or I-SceI or Cre expressing retroviruses. We found that the rate of translocation was similar for all three DNA damage-inducing enzymes (for der15 5×10?5 for AID, 10×10?5 for I-SceI and 3×10?5 for Cre, Figure 6 and Supplemental Figure S10 ). We conclude that the rate of c-myc/IgH translocation is similar irrespective of whether the DSBs are induced by AID, I-SceI or Cre. To determine whether AID is essential to create the breaks in c-myc that lead to c-myc/IgH translocation we induced DSBs in the IgH locus of IgHI/+AID?/? or the c-myc locus of MycI/+AID?/? B cells using I-SceI. In contrast to IgHI/+MycI/+AID?/? B cells ( Figure 4 ), and to AID sufficient MycI/+ and IgHI/+ B cells ( Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure S9 ), I-SceI induced DSBs in either c-myc or IgH alone, in MycI/+AID?/? or IgHI/+AID?/? B cells respectively, failed to produce c-myc/IgH translocations ( Figure 7 ). Thus, when I-SceI alone or I-SceI and AID coordinately generate DSBs on both chromosomes they result in c-myc/IgH translocations. In contrast, in the absence of AID, I-SceI-induced DSBs generated solely at IgH or c-myc do not produce translocations. We conclude that AID is essential for the DSBs in both of the chromosomes involved in c-myc/IgH translocation.

To determine whether AID is essential to create the breaks in c-myc that lead to c-myc/IgH translocation we induced DSBs in the IgH locus of IgHI/+AID?/? or the c-myc locus of MycI/+AID?/? B cells using I-SceI. In contrast to IgHI/+MycI/+AID?/? B cells ( Figure 4 ), and to AID sufficient MycI/+ and IgHI/+ B cells ( Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure S9 ), I-SceI induced DSBs in either c-myc or IgH alone, in MycI/+AID?/? or IgHI/+AID?/? B cells respectively, failed to produce c-myc/IgH translocations ( Figure 7 ). Thus, when I-SceI alone or I-SceI and AID coordinately generate DSBs on both chromosomes they result in c-myc/IgH translocations. In contrast, in the absence of AID, I-SceI-induced DSBs generated solely at IgH or c-myc do not produce translocations. We conclude that AID is essential for the DSBs in both of the chromosomes involved in c-myc/IgH translocation.  Discussion DSBs are dangerous lesions because they can lead to genomic instability and oncogenic chromosomal translocations. Although DSBs rarely accumulate in somatic cells, they are obligate intermediates in CSR, a reaction that involves introduction of multiple targeted DSBs in the IgH locus in mature B lymphocytes. The genome is normally protected from AID dependent IgH translocations by ATM-, p53- and p19Arf-dependent pathways that detect and signal DNA damage and oncogenic stress ( Ramiro et al., 2006 ). Nevertheless, these protective mechanisms sometimes fail, as evidenced by involvement of the IgH locus in nearly all cancer-associated chromosomal translocations in mature B cell lymphomas and multiple myeloma ( Kuppers and Dalla-Favera, 2001 ). AID creates the lesions in the IgH locus that lead to translocations ( Franco et al., 2006 ; Petersen et al., 2001 ; Ramiro et al., 2006 ; Ramiro et al., 2004 ). However, DSBs in IgH alone would not be sufficient for translocation because aberrant joining of heterologous chromosomes requires formation of paired DNA breaks ( Richardson and Jasin, 2000 ), and the source of DNA damage in the oncogenes that are translocated in mature B cell malignancies has not been determined ( Kuppers and Dalla-Favera, 2001 ). In Burkitt’s lymphoma and in murine plasmacytoma, IgH is translocated to c-myc leading to deregulated expression of c-myc and malignant transformation ( Adams et al., 1983 ; Adams et al., 1982 ; Adams et al., 1985 ; Crews et al., 1982 ; Dalla-Favera et al., 1983 ; Erikson et al., 1983 ; Hamlyn and Rabbitts, 1983 ; Marcu et al., 1983 ; Taub et al., 1982 ). Recurrent translocation between c-myc and IgH has been attributed in part to proximity of the two loci in B cells due to the dynamic relocation of the two genes to transcription factories following B cell activation ( Osborne et al., 2007 ; Roix et al., 2003 ). Consistent with a role for transcription in facilitating c-myc/IgH translocation our experiments show that the DNA region containing the c-myc promoters is required for efficient translocation in stimulated B cells. However, this effect does not appear to be due to transcriptionally regulated proximity of the two genes or accessibility to recombinase as indicated by equivalent levels of Cre mediated translocation between IgHI and transcriptionally crippled Myc? or active MycI alleles. In light of the current discussion about “breakage first” or “contact first” models of chromosomal translocations, our data does not speak directly to the issue of physical proximity, but suggest that proximity is not limiting. Although loss of the c-myc promoter region interferes with transcription and c-myc/IgH translocation, it does not interfere with c-myc’s ability to come into contact with IgH or with its accessibility to Cre. Instead, it appears that the c-myc promoter region is essential to recruit AID to initiate DSB formation. This is consistent with the finding that Ig transcriptional regulators including promoters, enhancers and the E-box motif CAGGTG ( Michael et al., 2003 ) are involved in targeting AID to Igs ( Di Noia and Neuberger, 2007 ; Peled et al., 2008 ; Stavnezer et al., 2008 ). Although the elements required for bringing AID to Ig or c-myc DNA have not yet been precisely defined, in vitro experiments with artificial substrates and in E. coli show that transcription is essential because it exposes single stranded DNA which is the substrate for AID ( Chaudhuri et al., 2003 ; Dickerson et al., 2003 ; Pham et al., 2003 ; Ramiro et al., 2003 ). Furthermore, the formation of R-loops during transcription has been proposed to play a role in targeting AID ( Yu et al., 2003 ). Thus, our observations suggest a transcriptional requirement for AID targeting to oncogenes, but the mechanism by which transcription targets AID to any gene remains to be determined. Although increased AID expression was found to increase c-myc/IgH translocation, this effect could have been due to higher levels of DNA breaks on c-myc or IgH or both ( Dorsett et al., 2008 ; Ramiro et al., 2006 ; Takizawa et al., 2008 ). Previous work suggested that DSBs in c-myc are AID independent and might be due to increased susceptibility of fragile non-B-DNA to environmental agents like reactive oxygen intermediates or transcriptional or replication-linked DNA damage ( Belotserkovskii et al., 2007 ; Boles and Hogan, 1987 ; Lieber et al., 2003 ; Wang and Xu, 2004 ; Yang and Hurley, 2006 ). This idea was supported by the finding of AID independent DSBs in c-myc in B cell lymphomas ( Zan et al., 2003 ), the relative rarity of somatic mutations in c-myc ( Liu et al., 2008 ; Pasqualucci et al., 2001 ; Shen et al., 1998 ), and the lack of deletions or duplications in c-myc that would mark DSB formation ( Gordon et al., 2003 ; Liu et al., 2008 ; Mullighan et al., 2007 ; Muschen et al., 2000 ; Pasqualucci et al., 1998 ; Pasqualucci et al., 2001 ; Shen et al., 1998 ). Despite these findings, our experiments show that AID can indeed induce lesions and mutations at c-myc , and demonstrate that AID is essential for the lesions in c-myc that result in c-myc/IgH translocation. Nevertheless, the absence of easily detectable DNA damage without AID over-expression suggests that formation of DNA lesions on c-myc may be one of the limiting factors in c-myc/IgH translocation under physiologic conditions. Consistent with this notion, we find that increasing the frequency of DSB formation by the I-SceI endonuclease at c-myc but not IgH enhances translocation. Since I-SceI targets c-myc and IgH with similar efficiency, we can also conclude that AID-induced DSB formation at c-myc is lower than at IgH . Although the DNA lesions introduced by either I-SceI or AID alone produced c-myc/IgH translocation, the extent of DNA processing and the structure of the intermolecular joints differed. The most extensive resection of DNA ends was found at c-myc when I-SceI mediated translocations in the absence of AID. Why the same resection was not detected at IgH under the same conditions is unclear, but the data is consistent with the existence of locus specific DNA damage processing factors ( Liu et al., 2008 ). Whereas I-SceI induced breaks were resolved by a mechanism biased toward junctional microhomology reminiscent of alternative NHEJ ( Richardson and Jasin, 2000 ), AID breaks produced a combination of blunt and short microhomology joints similar to those found in class switch recombination ( Stavnezer et al., 2008 ). The difference in trans-chromosomal joints between I-SceI and AID may be explained by recruitment of a distinct set of repair enzymes to the two types of DNA damage. In the case of I-SceI a DSB is introduced directly by the yeast endonuclease and must be recognized by the DNA damage recognition and repair system before being processed and joined. In contrast, AID induced U:G mismatches are recognized by mismatch and base excision repair enzymes before recruitment of additional repair factors that then process the lesions to produce DSBs. Thus, the difference in the joints produced by I-SceI breaks and AID lesions may in part be due to the distinct mechanisms that recognize the initial lesion and produce the DSB. Although the precise mechanism by which AID introduces lesions in DNA is still debated, AID is thought to produce U:G mismatches in DNA by cytidine deamination ( Di Noia and Neuberger, 2007 ; Peled et al., 2008 ; Stavnezer et al., 2008 ). In B cells undergoing SHM or CSR, uracyl is detected and removed from antibody genes by error prone mechanisms leading to mutations or DSBs. Other genes, including oncogenes, appear to repair such lesions in a relatively error free manner, which may explain the nearly undetectable level of AID mediated mutation in genes like c-myc ( Supplemental Table 1 and ( Liu et al., 2008 ; Pasqualucci et al., 2001 ; Shen et al., 1998 )). Our experiments reveal that like the error prone repair pathways that process the lesions at the IgH locus, the relatively error free repair of AID dependent lesions in c-myc can also lead to oncogene translocation.
