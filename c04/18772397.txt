Core Signaling Pathways in Human Pancreatic Cancers Revealed by Global Genomic Analyses There are currently few therapeutic options for patients with pancreatic cancer, and new insights into the pathogenesis of this lethal disease are urgently needed. Toward this end, we performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of 24 pancreatic cancers. We first determined the sequences of 23,219 transcripts, representing 20,661 protein-coding genes, in these samples. Then, we searched for homozygous deletions and amplifications in the tumor DNA by using microarrays containing probes for ~106 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We found that pancreatic cancers contain an average of 63 genetic alterations, the majority of which are point mutations. These alterations defined a core set of 12 cellular signaling pathways and processes that were each genetically altered in 67 to 100% of the tumors. Analysis of these tumors’ transcriptomes with next-generation sequencing-by-synthesis technologies provided independent evidence for the importance of these pathways and processes. Our data indicate that genetically altered core pathways and regulatory processes only become evident once the coding regions of the genome are analyzed in depth. Dysregulation of these core pathways and processes through mutation can explain the major features of pancreatic tumorigenesis.  Analysis of gene expression Gene expression patterns can inform the analysis of pathways because they can reflect epigenetic alterations not detectable by sequencing or copy number analyses. They can also point to downstream effects on gene expression resulting from the altered signaling pathways and processes described above. To analyze the transcriptome of pancreatic cancers, we performed SAGE [serial analysis of gene expression ( 28 )] on RNA from the same 24 cancers used for mutation analysis. When combined with massively parallel sequencing by synthesis, SAGE provides a highly quantitative and sensitive measure of gene expression. The approach described above is similar to that used in recent RNA-Seq studies ( 29 – 32 ), but SAGE has the advantage that the quantification does not depend on the length of the transcript. As a control for the current study, we microdissected histologically normal pancreatic duct epithelial cells because these cells are the presumed precursors of pancreatic cancers. As an additional control, we used human papillomavirus (HPV)–immortalized pancreatic duct epithelial (HPDE) cells, which have been shown to have many properties in common with normal duct epithelial cells ( 33 , 34 ). SAGE libraries were prepared from these cells as well as the 24 pancreatic cancers; an average of 5,737,000 tags was obtained from each library, and an average of 2,268,000 tags per library matched the sequence of known transcripts ( table S9 ). The expression analysis was first used to help identify target genes from amplified and homozygously deleted regions. Although a small fraction of these regions contained a known tumor suppressor gene or oncogene, many contained more than one gene that had not previously been implicated in cancer. In tables S5 and S6 , a presumptive target gene was identified within these regions through the use of the mutational and transcriptional data. For example, we assumed that a gene could not have been the target of an amplification event if that gene was not wholly contained within the amplicon and expressed in the tumor containing the amplification. Similarly, expression data can be used to help gauge the importance of genes containing missense mutations. A missense mutation in a gene that is not expressed in the tumor containing it is more likely to be a passenger than a mutation in a gene that is expressed ( table S3 ). Second, we determined whether the genes in the core signaling pathways and processes described above were differentially expressed. If the pathways and processes containing genetic alterations were indeed responsible for tumorigenesis, one might expect that many of the genes within these pathways would be aberrantly expressed. To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression of the gene sets constituting the 12 core signaling pathways and processes ( Table 2 and table S8 ). The 31 gene sets constituting these pathways were more highly enriched for differentially expressed genes than the remaining 3041 gene sets ( P < 0.001). These expression data thus independently support the contribution of these signaling pathways and processes to pancreatic tumorigenesis. Lastly, we attempted to identify individual genes rather than pathways that were differentially expressed in the cancers. The data in table S9 represent the largest compendium of digital expression data derived for any tumor type to date. There was a remarkably high number (541) of genes that were at least 10-fold overexpressed in >90% of the 24 cancers (compared to normal pancreatic duct cells or HPDE cells). To determine whether these genes were also overexpressed in the primary tumors from which the cell lines were made, we performed SAGE on five such primary tumors. These results confirmed these 541 genes’ overexpression in situ: The genes were, on average, expressed at 75-fold higher levels in the cell lines and at 88-fold higher levels in the primary tumors compared with their expression in normal duct epithelial cells. Notably, 54 of the overexpressed genes encoded proteins that are predicted to be secreted or expressed on the cell surface ( table S9 ). These over-expressed genes provide leads for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Implications for Pancreatic Tumorigenesis The extensive genetic studies described above suggest that the key to understanding pancreatic cancers lies in an appreciation of a core set of pathways and processes. We identified 12 partially overlapping processes that are genetically altered in the great majority of pancreatic cancers ( Fig. 3A ). However, the pathway components that are altered in any individual tumor vary widely ( Fig. 3, B and C ). For example, the two tumors depicted in Fig. 3, B and C , each contain mutations of a gene involved in the TGF-? pathway (one SMAD4 , the other BMPR2 ). Similarly, these two tumors both contain mutations of genes involved in most of the other 11 core processes and pathways, but the specific genes altered in each tumor are largely different. Although we cannot be certain that every identified mutation plays a functional role in the pathway or process in which it is implicated, it is clear from both the current and the previously published genetic data, as well as from past functional studies, that many of them are likely to affect these pathway(s). This perspective is likely to apply to most, if not all, epithelial tumors. It is consistent with the idea that genetic alterations can be classified as mountains (high-frequency mutations) or hills (low-frequency mutations), with the hills predominating in terms of the total number of alterations involved ( 14 ). The heterogeneity among pathway components and the varied nature of mutations within individual genes can explain tumor heterogeneity, a fundamental facet of all solid tumors ( 35 ). From an intellectual viewpoint, the pathway perspective helps bring order and rudimentary understanding to a very complex disease ( 36 – 38 ). Although the importance of signaling pathways in understanding neoplasia has been recognized ( 39 , 40 ), genomewide genetic analyses such as that described here can identify the precise genetic alterations that may be responsible for pathway dysregulation in each patient’s tumor. Because most genes are mutated in only a small fraction of tumors, it is only through analysis of functional gene groups that an appreciation for the true importance of these genes’ mutations in neoplasia can be reached. For example, from Table 2 it is evident that all pancreatic cancers studied had alterations in genes in the Wnt/Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways, a finding that could not have been appreciated in the absence of global analyses. In addition to yielding insights into tumor pathogenesis, such studies provide the data required for personalized cancer medicine. Unlike certain forms of leukemia, in which tumorigenesis appears to be driven by a single, targetable oncogene, pancreatic cancers result from genetic alterations of a large number of genes that function through a relatively small number of pathways and processes. Our studies suggest that the best hope for therapeutic development may lie in the discovery of agents that target the physiologic effects of the altered pathways and processes rather than their individual gene components. Thus, rather than seeking agents that target specific mutated genes, agents that broadly target downstream mediators or key nodal points may be preferable. Pathways that could be targeted include those causing metabolic disturbances, neoangiogenesis, misexpression of cell surface proteins, alterations of the cell cycle, cyto-skeletal abnormalities, and an impaired ability to repair genomic damage ( Table 2 and table S8 ).

The residues comprising the C2H2 group that coordinate the nearby Zn2+ ion are shown as ball-and-stick representations, H393 and H397 are shown in green and white, whereas C380 and C375 are shown in orange and red.

The residues corresponding to two of the mutant positions (F260S and S422F, shown as red and yellow space-fills, respectively, in chain A) are located at interfaces and could perturb Smad3-Smad3 or Smad3-Smad4 interactions. In chain B, F260 is shown as cyan space-fills and S422 as green space-fills. ( D ) The x-ray crystal structure of the extracellular domain of human DPP6 as a homodimer (PDBID 1XFD). Two of the mutated residues found in this study, T409I (shown as red space-fills) and D475N (shown in yellow space-fills) are in spatial proximity and are close to one of the glycosylation sites, N471 (shown as white space-fills). These mutations fall in the ?-propeller domain of the protein (residues 142 to 322 and 351 to 581) thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. The A778T mutation (shown as blue space-fills) falls in the */? hydrolase domain (residues 127 to 142 and 581 to 849) and is close to the homodimer region of the protein and could perturb the homodimer association.
