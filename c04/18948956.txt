P53 and Pten control neural and glioma stem/progenitor cell renewal and differentiation Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal brain tumor presenting as one of two subtypes with distinct clinical histories and molecular profiles. The primary GBM subtype presents acutely as high-grade disease that typically harbors EGFR, Pten and Ink4a/Arf mutations, and the secondary GBM subtype evolves from the slow progression of low-grade disease that classically possesses PDGF and p53 events 1 – 3 . Here, we show that concomitant CNS-specific deletion of p53 and Pten in the mouse CNS generates a penetrant acute-onset high-grade malignant glioma phenotype with striking clinical, pathological and molecular resemblance to primary GBM in humans. This genetic observation prompted p53 and Pten mutational analysis in human primary GBM, demonstrating unexpectedly frequent inactivating mutations of p53 as well the expected Pten mutations. Integrated transcriptomic profiling, in silico promoter analysis and functional studies of murine neural stem cells (NSCs) established that dual, but not singular, inactivation of p53 and Pten promotes an undifferentiated state with high renewal potential and drives elevated c-Myc levels and its associated signature. Functional studies validated increased c-Myc activity as a potent contributor to the impaired differentiation and enhanced renewal of p53-Pten null NSCs as well as tumor neurospheres (TNSs) derived from this model. c-Myc also serves to maintain robust tumorigenic potential of p53-Pten null TNSs. These murine modeling studies, together with confirmatory transcriptomic/promoter studies in human primary GBM, validate a pathogenetic role of a common tumor suppressor mutation profile in human primary GBM and establish c-Myc as a key target for cooperative actions of p53 and Pten in the regulation of normal and malignant stem/progenitor cell differentiation, self-renewal and tumorigenic potential.  Full Methods Mice P53 L and hGFAP-Cre mice have been described previously 5 , 7 . Pten L mice were generated using a standard knock-in approach in which Pten exon 5 is flanked by loxP sites (details on targeting construct and procedures are available upon request). Mice were interbred and maintained on FvB/C57Bl6 hybrid background in pathogen-free conditions at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, monitored for signs of ill-health every other day, and euthanized and necropsied when moribund. All manipulations were performed with IACUC approval. Histology and Immunohistochemistry At time of sacrifice, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and brains were dissected, followed by overnight post-fixation in 4% PFA at 4°C. Serial sections were prepared at 5 µm for paraffin sections or 10 µm for cryostat sections with every tenth slide stained by haematoxylin and eosin (DF/HCC Research Pathology Cores). Tumor grading was determined by K.L.L and H.Z. based upon the WHO grading system for malignant astrocytoma 8 . Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses were performed as described 31 . The PDGFR?/pEGFR double immunohistochemical staining was performed using DakoCytomation EnVision doublestain system (K1395, Dako) following manufacturer instructions. The primary antibodies used were: Ki67 (VP-RM04, Vector), GFAP (Z0334, DAKO), GFAP (556330, BD Pharmingen), Nestin (MAB353, Chemicon; specifically for mouse), Nestin (MAB5326, Chemicon; specifically for human), Pten (9559, Cell Signaling), Phospho-AktSer473 (3787, Cell Signaling), phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (2215, Cell Signaling), Cyclin D1 (18-0220, ZYMED), VEGF (sc-152, Santa Cruz), PDGFR? (3174, Cell Signaling), Phospho-PDGFRaY754 (sc-12911, Santa Cruz), EGFR (IHC-00005, Bethyl), Phospho-EGFRY1068 (ab40815, Abcam), Phospho-EGFRY1173 (sc-12351, Santa Cruz), Olig-2 (AB9610, Chemicon), TUJ-1 (MMS-435P, Covance), O4 (MAB1326, R&D), NeuN (MAB377, Millipore), MBP (ab7349, Abcam), c-Myc (ABcam, ab39688), and Cre (69050-3, Novagen). Images were captured using a Leica DM1400B microsystem and Leica FW4000 version 1.2.1. Cell culture Primary NSCs were isolated from the brain subventricular zone (SVZ) of E13.5 embryos or 1 month old mice with the indicated genotype as previously described 31 , 32 . NSCs were maintained in NSC proliferation media (05702, StemCell) supplemented with 20 ng/mL EGF (E4127, Sigma) and 10ng/mL bFGF (F0291, Sigma). To generate primary TNS cells, tumor samples from freshly dissected mouse brains were subjected to mechanical and enzymatic dissociation. Single-cell suspensions were cultured in NSC proliferation media. Tumor spheres formed were then disaggregated and used for indicated assays. NSC differentiation assays were carried out by plating the indicated cells in culture wells on coverslips pre-coated with 15 µg/mL poly-L-ornithine (P3655, Sigma) and 1 µg/mL fibronectin (F1141, Sigma); the cells were incubated in neurobasal medium supplemented with 1% FBS for 7–10 days, and the differentiation capacities examined under either light or fluorescence microscope (Nikon). For TNS cell differentiation, cells were incubated in differentiation media with varying doses of triciribine (BioMol) or vehicle (DMSO, Sigma). Knockdown of mouse c-Myc was performed by infecting the indicated cells with lentivirus containing shMyc constructs (provided by Dr. William Hahn, Dana Farber Cancer Institute). The shRNA constructs shMyc #1, #2 and #3 correspond to clone ID#s TRCN000000 54856, 42517 and 42513, respectively (The DFCI-Broad RNAi Consortium, commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich). Western, cell growth and self-renewal assays Western blot assays were performed as previously described 31 with antibodies against c-Myc (sc-42, Santa Cruz), Phospho-AKTSer473 (9271, Cell signaling), Pten (9569, Cell Signaling) and Actin (sc-1615, Santa Cruz). For in vitro cell growth assays, NSCs or TNS cells (10,000) were plated in triplicate in 96-well format and incubated in NSC proliferation media for 5 days, and growth was quantified using Luminescence ATP detection assay system (PerkinElmer). Self-renewal capacity was measured by plating 1,000 cells/well (6-well plate) in NSC proliferation media containing EGF/bFGF with 0.3% agarose (A9049, Sigma). The number of neurospheres or tumor neurospheres that formed subsequently per well was quantified after 10–14 days and relative sphere formation was plotted versus indicated control. Three replicates were performed for each. All experiments were conducted at cell passage <5. Orthotopic transplants Female SCID (Charles River) aged 6–8 weeks were anesthetized and placed into stereotactic apparatus equipped with a Z axis (Stoelting). A small hole was bored in the skull 0.5 mm anterior and 3.0 mm lateral to the Bregma using a dental drill. 2×104 cells in Hanks Buffered Salt Solution was injected into the right caudate nucleus 3 mm below the surface of the brain using a 10 µl Hamilton syringe with an unbeveled 30 gauge needle. The scalp was closed using a 9 mm Autoclip Applier. Animals were followed daily for development of neurological deficits. Mutation screening Frozen tumor specimens were obtained from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center tumor bank. Genomic DNA was prepared from frozen primary GBM tumour samples using the Qiagen genomic purification kit. Coding exons were PCR amplified and sequenced using standard protocols at the Harvard Partners Center for Genetics and Genomics as previously described 33 . All known single-nucleotide polymorphisms and synonymous mutations were removed from the analysis in the current study. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital. Microarray analysis Early passage wild-type and indicated mutant NSCs were incubated with NSC proliferation media or differentiation media for 18 hours. RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Gene expression profiling was performed utilizing the Affymetrix 430 2.0 chips at DFCI Microarray core facility. Promoter Analysis Gene expressions were modeled using dChip software 34 . Sets of genes differentially expressed pre- and post- differentiation induction were generated using the SAM statistic 35 , with a cutoff of +/? 2.0. Promoter analysis on both these gene sets used the CisGenome software ( http://biogibbs.stanford.edu/~jihk/CisGenome/index.htm ) to scan the 8 kb upstream to 2kb downstream regions of these genes for the ~550 motifs in the TRANSFAC 12.1 database. Enrichment was measured against control regions at a comparable distance from the transcription start sites of random genes. Statistical analysis Tumor-free survivals were analyzed using Graphpad Prism4. Statistical analyses were performed using nonparametric Mann–Whitney test. Significance of enrichment in the promoter analysis was computed based on Poisson distribution with Bonferroni correction. Comparisons of cell growth, self-renewal and differentiation were performed using the unpaired Student's t-test. For all experiments with error bars, standard deviation was calculated to indicate the variation within each experiment and data, and values represent mean ± s.d.
