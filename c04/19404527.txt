Methodological issues affecting estimates of bleeding risks and consequences after venous thromboembolism  Conclusion It is very likely that the high absolute risk of bleeding found in the Worcester Venous Thromboembolism Study is attributable to the inclusion of a substantial number of frail patients, many near death, who are typically excluded from randomized trials and registry studies. Additional studies seem warranted to clarify optimal treatment strategies in such patients.
