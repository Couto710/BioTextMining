The Number of RSV-Specific Memory CD8 T Cells in the Lung is Critical for their Ability to Inhibit Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Vaccine-Enhanced Pulmonary Eosinophilia 1 Children that were administered a formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (FI-RSV) vaccine experienced enhanced respiratory disease, including pulmonary eosinophilia, after contracting a natural RSV infection. RSV vaccine-enhanced disease can be mimicked in BALB/c mice immunized with either FI-RSV or with a recombinant vaccinia virus (vacv) expressing the RSV attachment (G) protein. We have recently demonstrated that memory CD8 T cells directed against the RSV immunodominant M282?90 epitope inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia in either vacvG- or FI-RSV-immunized mice by reducing the total number of Th2 cells in the lung after RSV challenge. Here we show that memory CD8 T cells specific to a subdominant epitope within the RSV fusion (F) protein fail to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of mice previously co-immunized with vacvF and with either vacvG or FI-RSV. We observed that the inability of RSV F85-specific memory CD8 T cells to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia was largely due to an inadequate total number of F85-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung at early times after RSV challenge. Increasing the number of F85-specific memory CD8 T cells after immunization grants them the ability to inhibit RSV vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia. Moreover, we demonstrate that RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells, when present in sufficient numbers, inhibit the production of the Th2-associated chemokines CCL17 and CCL22. Taken together, these results indicate that RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells may alter the trafficking of Th2 cells and eosinophils into the lung.  Introduction Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 3 infection is the leading cause of hospitalization in children under the age of 5 and also causes significant morbidity in the elderly and immunocomprimised ( 1 - 3 ). Despite the clear need for an RSV vaccine, efforts to create one have been unsuccessful. The potential pitfalls associated with RSV immunization were highlighted during a series of trials of a formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine that were conducted during the 1960s. During these trials, ?80% of the FI-RSV vaccinated children required hospitalization and 2 children died after contracting a natural RSV infection ( 4 - 6 ). Histological examination of the lungs from the deceased children revealed extensive mononuclear cell infiltration including the presence of eosinophils ( 4 - 6 ). The successful establishment of a mouse model that mimics the RSV vaccine-enhanced disease observed in humans has greatly aided our understanding of the immune determinants that contribute to pathology. In this model, BALB/c mice are immunized with either FI-RSV or a recombinant vaccinia virus (vacv) that expresses the RSV attachment (G) protein (vacvG), both of which elicit an RSV-specific CD4 T cell response and do not prime a detectable RSV-specific CD8 T cell response ( 7 - 12 ). After subsequent RSV challenge, both FI-RSV- and vacvG-immunized mice develop robust RSV-specific memory CD4 T cell responses, pulmonary eosinophilia, and vaccine-enhanced disease that is similar to the disease observed in the children from the FI-RSV vaccine trials ( 9 , 10 , 12 , 13 ). Previous work has demonstrated that both FI-RSV- and vacvG-immunized mice that also undergo a concurrent RSV-specific memory CD8 T cell response specific to the immunodominant RSV M282?90 CD8 T cell epitope have significantly reduced levels of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge as compared to controls ( 7 , 14 ). These data suggest that RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells inhibit the Th2 response that is necessary for the development of pulmonary eosinophilia. Besides the well-defined immunodominant M282-specific CD8 T cell response in BALB/c mice, several other sub-dominant CD8 T cell epitopes have been identified ( 15 , 16 ). The RSV fusion (F) protein contains a subdominant CD8 T cell epitope between amino acids 85?93. CD8 T cells that recognize the F85 epitope comprise approximately 2?5% of the CD8 T cells in the lung at the peak of the response after acute RSV infection ( 15 ). Previous work has demonstrated that vacvF-immunized mice develop a robust pulmonary CD4 and CD8 T cell response after RSV challenge ( 17 - 19 ). Interestingly, antibody-mediated depletion of either CD8 T cells or IFN-? in vacvF-immunized mice results in the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 19 , 20 ). These data suggest that IFN-? produced by F85-specific CD8 T cells prevents the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of vacvF-immunized mice. However, it remains unclear if F85-specific memory CD8 T cells can inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of either vacvG- or FI-RSV-immunized mice. We demonstrate here that only either vacvG- or FI-RSV-immunized mice that are also co-immunized with vacvM2, and not with vacvF, exhibit reduced levels of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge. Interestingly, there are similar numbers of M282- and F85-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of either vacvG plus vacvM2- or vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice at day 7 post-RSV challenge. Although the total number of RSV-specific cells in the lung is similar in vacvG-immunized mice undergoing a concurrent M282- or F85-specific CD8 T cell response 7 days post-RSV challenge, the total number of the F85-specific memory CD8 T cells is dramatically reduced compared to M282-specific CD8 T cells at early times (days 0?3) after RSV challenge. Importantly, decreasing the total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells early after RSV challenge leads to the development of pulmonary eosinophilia, and increasing the total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells early after RSV infection results in diminished eosinophilia. Furthermore, we go on to demonstrate that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells modulate the pulmonary protein levels of Th2-associated chemokines such as CCL17 and CCL22. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the total number of RSV-specific CD8 T cells in the lung early after infection dictates their ability to regulate the events that are required for the development of pulmonary eosinophilia.  Methods Viruses and infection of mice The A2 strain of RSV was a gift from B.S. Graham (National Institutes of Health; NIH, Bethesda, MD) and was propagated in HEp-2 cells (American Type Culture Collections; ATCC, Manassas, VA). Recombinant vacv were a gift from T.J. Braciale (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) and J.L. Beeler (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD) and were propagated in BSC-40 cells (ATCC). BALB/cAnNCr mice between 6?10 weeks of age were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD). IFN-?-deficient C.129S7(B6)-Ifngtm1Ts/J mice were originally purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Each mouse was scarified with 3×106 PFU of recombinant vacv or a mixture of two different recombinant vacv and challenged with RSV 3 weeks later as previously described ( 7 ). Alternatively, BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with a 1:200 dilution of FI-RSV or formalin-inactivated mock preparation of HEp-2 cell supernatants as previously described ( 21 ). Four weeks after mock or FI-RSV-immunization, mice were scarified with 3×106 PFU of vacvM2 or vacvF and 4 weeks later were challenged intranasaly with 3×106 PFU of RSV. All mouse experiments have been evaluated and approved by the University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee. Mononuclear cell isolation and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) Lung mononuclear cells and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells were harvested and prepared as previously described ( 7 ). Cytospin (Cytospin 2; Cytospin, Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA) preparations of BAL cells were stained with Diff-Quik (Baxter Healthcare, Miami, FL) prior to analysis. Differential cell counts were performed on at least 200 cells based on standard morphology and staining characteristics. Lungs were subsequently perfused with 5 ml of PBS prior to removal. Lung mononuclear cells were isolated by pressing the lung tissue through a wire mesh screen (Cellector, Bellco Glass, Inc., Vineland, NJ). Peptides corresponding to the CD4 T cell epitopes G183?195 and F51?66 and the CD8 T cell epitopes F85?93 and M282?90 were purchased from Biosynthesis Inc., Lewisville, TX. To enumerate the number of RSV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells, lung mononuclear cells were stimulated in vitro in the presence of 1 ?M peptide and 10 ?g/ml brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 5 hours at 37°C. Cells were subsequently stained for cell surface CD4, CD8, Thy1.2 and intracellular IFN-? as previously described ( 7 ). Peripheral blood was collected from isoflourane anethsitized mice by eye bleed into 4% (w/v) sodium citrate. Blood was subsequently lysed with NH4Cl and washed with RPMI. Enumeration of F85- or M282-specific CD8 T cells in the blood was performed by in vitro stimulation in either the presence or the absence of an optimized number (1:3 target:effector ratio) of P815 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) coated with 1 ?M of either F85?93 or M282?90 peptide followed by ICS for IFN-?. Lamp 1/2 and granzyme B staining were done in combination with IFN-? ICS. Lamp 1 (clone 1D4B, BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) and Lamp 2 (clone M3/84, Biolegend, San Diego, CA) antibodies were added prior to incubation of lung mononuclear cells with P815 cells coated with 1 ?M F85?93 peptide in the presence of 2 ?M monensin (Sigma-Aldrich). Granzyme B (Caltag, Burlingame, CA) staining was done after the 5 hour ICS incubation in the presence of 1 ?M F85?93 peptide and 10 ?g/ml brefeldin A. Plaque assays Lungs were harvested from vacv-immunized mice on either day 4 or 7 post-RSV challenge in 1 ml of serum-free RPMI. Lung tissue was disrupted using a tissue homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax T25, IKA, Wilmington, NC) and lung homogenates were subsequently centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. Cell-free supernatants were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples were thawed and then subjected to plaque assay on Vero cells as previously described ( 7 ). ELISA Lungs and BAL were harvested 3 days post-RSV challenge of vacv-immunized mice. Lungs were disrupted using a tissue homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax T25, IKA) in 10% FCS containing RPMI containing a 1:200 dilution of a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). BAL samples were collected via lavage of the lung with 1 ml of RPMI containing 10% FCS. Lung homogenates and BAL samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes and chemokine protein content for CCL11, CCL17 and CCL22 in the supernatants was subsequently determined by ELISA as previously described ( 19 ). For CXCL10 (IP-10) and CCL5 (RANTES) ELISAs, flat-bottom 96-well plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY) were coated overnight at 4°C with 2 ?g/ml of purified anti-CXCL10 and anti-CCL5 (all Abs from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). After extensive washing, samples were added to coated plates in 50 ?L per well followed by incubation overnight at 4°C. Biotinylated detection antibodies for CXCL10 and CCL5 (R&D systems) at 0.1 ?g/ml were added to plates for 2 hours at room temperature. Following incubation with the biotinylated antibodies, plates were washed and developed as previously described ( 19 ). ELISA plates were analyzed by an Elx800 reader (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT) and data was analyzed using KC Junior (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.) software. Detection limits for chemokine protein levels were: CXCL10, 624 pg/ml; CCL5, 62.5 pg/ml; CCL11, 31.2 pg/ml; CCL17, 62.5 pg/ml; and CCL22, 15.6 pg/ml. Dendritic cell (DC) generation and immunization Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3)-secreting B16-melanoma cells were a gift from J.T. Harty (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) and were cultured in RPMI containing 10% FCS. 1×106 Flt3-secreting-B16 melanoma cells were injected i.p. into BALB/c mice in 200 ?l of PBS. At 14 days post-injection, mice were injected i.p. with 2 ?g of LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) in 200 ?l of PBS. The following day, spleens from these mice were harvested in PBS and single cell suspensions were prepared as described above. The DC content of these cells was determined by staining for CD11c (clone N418, eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and MHC II (clone M5/114.15.2, eBioscience). Maturation of DCs was monitored by expression of CD80 (clone 16?10A1, eBioscience) and CD86 (clone GL1, eBioscience). Greater than 90% of DCs routinely expressed these co-stimulatory molecules (data not shown). The whole cell suspension was then incubated at 37°C for 1 hour in either the presence or the absence of 1 ?M F85?93 peptide in PBS containing 2% normal rat serum (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Cells were washed twice in PBS and 1×106 DCs, as determined by flow cytometry, were injected i.v. into naïve recipients. Data analysis and statistics Statistical analyses were performed using Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data were analyzed using a student's t-test or, where noted, by ANOVA followed by a Tukey post-test. Differences were considered significant when p <0.05.

Results RSV-specific T cell responses in vacv-immunized mice Previous work has demonstrated that RSV M282-specific memory CD8 T cells inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of either vacvG- or FI-RSV-immunized mice ( 7 , 14 ). The F protein of RSV elicits a subdominant CD8 T cell response directed against amino acids 85?93 ( 15 ). It is currently unclear if F85-specific memory CD8 T cells can inhibit vacvG-induced pulmonary eosinophilia. Mice immunized with a 1:1 ratio of either vacvG and vacvF (vacvG plus vacvF) or vacvG and vacvM2 (vacvG plus vacvM2) induced a similar total number of antigen-specific CD8 T cells 7 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 1A, B ). With similar total numbers of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells, we predicted that F85-specific CD8 T cells would inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia in vacvG-immunized mice. Surprisingly, vacvG plus vacv?-gal- and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice developed similar frequencies ( Figure 1C ) and total numbers ( Figure 1D ) of eosinophils in the BAL 7 days post-RSV challenge, whereas, mice immunized with vacvG plus vacvM2 exhibited a significant reduction ( p <0.05) in both the frequency and the total number of eosinophils in the BAL at this time ( Figure 1C, D ). As previously described ( 7 ), only vacvG plus vacvM2- and not vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice demonstrated a significant decrease ( p <0.05) in the total number of G183-specific CD4 T cells ( Figure 1E ). As expected only mice immunized with either vacvG plus vacvF or vacvF alone mounted an enhanced F51-specific CD4 and F85-specific CD8 T cell response ( Figure 1A, F ). Furthermore, only vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice exhibited an increased total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells over the acute (i.e. vacv?-gal-immunized) RSV response ( Figure 1B ). M2<sub>82</sub>-specific but not F<sub>85</sub>-specific CD8 T cells inhibit the V?14<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cell response Immunization of BALB/c mice with vacvG induces an oligoclonal V?14+ CD4 T cell population that is required for the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 8 , 22 ). Previously, we have demonstrated that RSV M282-specific CD8 T cells inhibit the total number of CD4 as well as V?14+ CD4 T cells in the lung after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice ( 7 ). Having shown that F85-specific CD8 T cells do not inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice; we next asked if these cells were also unable to inhibit the expansion of CD4 and V?14+ CD4 T cells in the lung after RSV challenge. Figure 2 demonstrates that only mice immunized with vacvG plus vacvM2 and not vacvG plus vacvF exhibited a significantly reduced ( p <0.05) total number of CD4 ( Figure 2A ) and V?14+ CD4 T cells ( Figure 2B ) in the lung after RSV challenge. Viral clearance in immunized mice We analyzed virus clearance to determine its potential role in the differential development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of mice previously immunized with either vacvG plus vacvF or vacvG plus vacvM2. All immunized mice had significantly decreased ( p <0.05) viral titers at both day 4 and day 7 post-RSV challenge as compared to vacv?-gal immunized mice that do not mount an RSV-specific memory T cell response ( Figure 3 ). Additionally, both vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice, which undergo both memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, had significantly reduced ( p <0.05) viral titers in their lungs as compared to vacvG plus vacv?-gal-immunized mice at day 4 post-RSV challenge. However, there was no significant difference ( p >0.05) in the viral titers in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice at day 4 post-RSV challenge, suggesting that differential clearance of the virus does not account for the difference in pulmonary eosinophilia exhibited by these mice (see Figure 1 ). F<sub>85</sub>-specific CD8 T cells fail to inhibit FI-RSV-induced vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia We have previously demonstrated that induction of an M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response in FI-RSV-immunized mice inhibits the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 7 ). The pulmonary eosinophilia that occurs after RSV challenge of FI-RSV-immunized mice is independent of the oligoclonal V?14+ CD4 T cell expansion that is required for the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice ( 11 ). We have shown (see Figure 2 ) that only M282-specific and not F85-specific memory CD8 T cells reduce the total number of V?14+ CD4 T cells in the lung after RSV challenge of vacvG plus vacvM2- and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice, respectively. Therefore it remained possible that F85-specific memory CD8 T cells could inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of FI-RSV- but not vacvG-immunized mice. To determine if F85-specific memory CD8 T cells can inhibit pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of FI-RSV-immunized mice, mice were either mock treated or immunized intramuscularly with FI-RSV. Four weeks after initial priming, mice were subsequently immunized with vacv?-gal, vacvF, or vacvM2 prior to intranasal challenge with RSV after an additional 4 weeks. Figure 4 demonstrates that only FI-RSV-immunized mice co-immunized with vacvM2 and not vacvF have significantly reduced ( p <0.05) total numbers ( Figure 4A ) of eosinophils in the BAL. Similar to what we have previously observed with vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice (see Figure 1 ), there was not a significant difference ( p >0.05) in the total number of either F85- or M282-specific CD8 T cells in FI-RSV/vacvM2- and FI-RSV/vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 4B ). Function of F<sub>85</sub>- and M2<sub>82</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cells One possible reason F85-specific memory CD8 T cells are unable to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of either vacvG- or FI-RSV-immunized mice may be due to a defect in their effector function. To address this, we compared the ability of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells to produce common CD8 T cell effector cytokines (i.e. IFN-?, TNF-?, or IL-2) by ICS. Interestingly, F85-specific CD8 T cells contained a higher frequency of cells capable of co-producing the cytokines IFN-? and either TNF-? or IL-2 as compared to M282-specific CD8 T cells ( Figure 5 A, B ). Furthermore, the relative amount of IFN-?, TNF-?, and IL-2 produced, as measured by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), was greater in F85-specific CD8 T cells as compared to M282-specific CD8 T cells ( Figure 5C ). Taken together, these data suggest that F85-specific CD8 T cells exhibit at least similar if not greater cytokine production capacity as compared to their M282-specific counterparts. Kinetics of the F<sub>85</sub>- and M2<sub>82</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cell responses Although we found equivalent numbers of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lung at day 7 post-RSV challenge, it was unclear if the early kinetics of the F85- and M282-specific memory CD8 T cell responses were similar. Therefore, we examined the total number of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lung prior to and at various time points after RSV challenge. Figure 6 demonstrates that prior to RSV challenge (21 days post-vacv-immunization) there are significantly greater ( p <0.05, 3?4 fold) total numbers of M282-specific CD8 T cells in the spleen, blood, inguinal lymph nodes, and lungs of vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice ( Figure 6A ) as compared to F85-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice. Furthermore, there are significantly ( p <0.05) more M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice as compared to the number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice 3 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 6B ). Consistent with the data presented in Figure 1 , the total number of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells at day 7 post-RSV challenge is not significantly different ( p >0.05, Figure 6B ). These results suggest that the total number of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung at early time points after RSV challenge may be a critical determinant to the inhibition of pulmonary eosinophilia. We next asked if this discrepancy between the early kinetics of the F85- and M282-specific memory CD8 T cell responses could account for their differential ability to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia. We therefore altered the magnitude of the M282-specific memory response by immunizing mice with a ratio of 200:1 vacvG to vacvM2 (200 vacvG:vacvM2) in an attempt to match the early kinetics of the F85-specific CD8 T cell response. Figure 7 demonstrates that the total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice at 3 days post-RSV challenge is 3?4 fold greater than the total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 7A ). Mice immunized with 200 vacvG:vacvM2 had an equivalent total number of M282-specifc cells in the lung as compared to the total number of F85-specific cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice 3 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 7A ). As shown above, at day 7 post-RSV challenge, there were similar total numbers of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice, respectively ( Figure 7B ). Importantly, there were substantially more M282-specific CD8 T cells in 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice as compared to vacv?-gal-immunized mice, indicating that we successfully primed a M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response ( Figure 7B ). However, the M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response in 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice is significantly reduced (?2?3-fold, p <0.05) as compared to vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice at day 7 post-RSV challenge ( Figure 7B ). Mice immunized with vacvG plus vacv?-gal have a robust RSV G183-specific CD4 T cell response at day 7 after RSV challenge ( Figure 7C ). This G183-specific CD4 T cell response is significantly reduced ( p <0.05) in mice undergoing a concurrent M282-specific, but not a concurrent F85-specific, memory CD8 T cell response ( Figure 7C ). Interestingly, when we equalized the M282- and F85-specific response at day 3 post-RSV challenge by immunizing mice with 200 vacvG:vacvM2 ( Figure 7A ) we observed a significant increase ( p <0.05) in the total number of G183-specific CD4 T cells at day 7 after RSV challenge. As demonstrated above, mice immunized with vacvG plus vacv?-gal and vacvG plus vacvF have similar total numbers ( Figure 7D ) of eosinophils and this is significantly reduced ( p <0.05) in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice after RSV challenge ( Figure 7D ). Interestingly, 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice have similar levels of pulmonary eosinophilia as compared to vacvG plus vacv?-gal- and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 7D ). To ensure that M282-specific CD8 T cells induced by vacvG plus vacvM2 and 200 vacvG:vacvM2 immunization behave similarly after RSV challenge we compared the frequency of IFN-?-producing CD8 T cells ( Figure 7E ) and the MFI of IFN-? produced by these cells by IFN-? ICS ( Figure 7F ). Figure 7E demonstrates that there is a slight decrease in the frequency of IFN-?-producing cells that is consistent with the 2- to 3-fold decrease in the total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells noted above ( Figure 7B ). Additionally, M282-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2 and 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice produce IFN-? at a similar per cell capacity as measured by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IFN-? which is significantly greater than the non-stimulated controls ( p <0.05). These data indicate that the early kinetics of entry and accumulation in the lung by RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells is a major determinant of their ability to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice. M2<sub>82</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cells alter Th2-associated chemokine levels early after RSV challenge Th2-associated chemokines are important in the development of RSV vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia ( 19 , 23 - 25 ). The production of several Th2-associated chemokines peaks early after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice ( 26 ). Therefore, we asked if either a concurrent F85- or M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response would reduce the early Th2-associated chemokine production after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice. Lungs and BAL were harvested 3 days post-RSV challenge and subsequently analyzed for protein levels of either Th1-associated (CXCL10, CCL5) or Th2-associated (CCL11, CCL17, CCL22) chemokines by ELISA. Mice immunized with vacvG, vacvG plus vacvF, vacvG plus vacvM2, or 200 vacvG:vacvM2 showed similar enhanced protein levels of all Th1-associated chemokines and interestingly the Th2-associated chemokine CCL11 in both the lung and BAL ( Figure 8A, B ). Our data also demonstrates that only M282-specific, but not F85-specific, memory CD8 T cells are able to significantly decrease ( p <0.05) protein levels of CCL17 and CCL22 in both the lung and BAL ( Figure 8A, B ). Importantly, mice immunized with 200 vacvG:vacvM2 had increased levels ( p <0.05) of CCL17 and CCL22 as compared to mice immunized with vacvG plus vacvM2, suggesting that a reduced number of M282-specific memory CD8 T cells are unable to alter the chemokine environment ( Figure 8A, B ). These data indicate that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells prevent the trafficking of Th2 cells, and possibly eosinophils, into the lung by inhibiting the early production of the Th2-associated chemokines CCL17 and CCL22. Boosting the F<sub>85</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cell response results in the inhibition of pulmonary eosinophilia Having established that reducing the total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells that enter the lung early after RSV infection results in the development of pulmonary eosinophilia ( Figure 7 ), we next asked if increasing the number of memory F85-specific CD8 T cells early after RSV challenge would result in the abrogation of pulmonary eosinophilia. Mice were immunized with 1×106 DCs that were either left untreated or coated with F85?93-peptide. After 2?3 weeks, DC-immunized mice were subesequently immunized with vacv?-gal, vacvG plus vacv?-gal, or vacvG plus vacvF and challenged with RSV after an additional 3 weeks of rest. We were unable to detect F85-specific CD8 T cells in either the peripheral blood or lungs of mice immunized with DC-F85?93 and vacv?-gal whereas we were able to detect a low number of F85-specific CD8 T cells after DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF immunization ( Figure 9A, B ). However, mice immunized with DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF exhibited a significantly greater ( p <0.05) number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in both the peripheral blood and lung 21 days post-vacv-immunization as compared to DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 9A, B ), demonstrating that we were able to boost the number of F85-specific memory CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood and lung ?5- to 10-fold. At day 3 after RSV challenge of DC and vacv-immunized mice there was a significantly ( p <0.05) greater total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice as compared to their DC-no peptide-immunized counterparts ( Figure 9B ). After RSV challenge only DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice had a significantly decreased ( p <0.05) total number of eosinophils in the lungs as compared to vacvG plus vacv?-gal immunized mice ( Figure 9C ). Interestingly, there was only a 2-to 3-fold increase ( p <0.05) in the total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells at day 7 post-RSV challenge in the lungs of DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice as compared to DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 9D ). These data demonstrate that F85-specific memory CD8 T cells are capable of inhibiting the development of pulmonary eosinophilia if present in high enough numbers at the time of and/or early after RSV challenge. Furthermore, these data provide strong evidence that both the total numbers and early kinetics of entry into the lung of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells are critical for the control of RSV vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia. Characteristics of F<sub>85</sub>-specific CD8 T cells in DC- and vacv-immunized mice One drawback to utilizing the DC prime and boost methodology described above to increase the total number of F85-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung is that the resultant cells are now secondary memory cells, as compared to primary memory cells generated after vacvG plus vacvF immunization. Consequently, the F85-specific secondary memory CD8 T cells may differ in their phenotypic or functional characteristics. To address this issue, we examined the functional and phenotypic characteristics of F85-specific memory CD8 T cells at day 21 after vacvG plus vacvF immunization of mice previously immunized with DCs that were either left untreated or coated with F85?93 peptide. DC-no peptide-immunized mice exhibited a greater frequency of cells expressing CD62L, but not TNF-? or IL-2 as compared to mice immunized with DC-F85?93 ( Table 1 ). However, after RSV challenge of mice previously immunized with either DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF- or DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF, F85-specific primary and secondary memory CD8 T cells exhibited similar functional avidity ( Figure 10A ), degranulation, as determined by Lamp 1/2 staining ( Figure 10B ) and similar expression of intracellular granzyme B ( Figure 10C ). However, there was a difference in the ability of these cells to produce the cytokines TNF-? and IL-2 ( Figure 10D, E ). These data suggest that although there are some phenotypical and functional differences in F85-specific cells in DC-no peptide and DC-F85?93-immunized mice, these differences are relatively small and are unlikely to greatly alter their ability to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia. F<sub>85</sub>-specific CD8 T cells, when present at sufficient numbers early after RSV challenge, alter the pulmonary chemokine environment As demonstrated above, M282-specific memory CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice are present at higher numbers early after RSV challenge as compared to F85-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figures 6 and 7 ). Additionally, these M282-specific CD8 T cells are able to alter the pulmonary chemokine environment whereas the F85-specific CD8 T cells, that are present at lower numbers, are not ( Figure 8 ). To determine if increasing the total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells by DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF immunization (see Figure 9 ) would also alter the pulmonary chemokine environment, DC- and vacv-immunized mice were harvested 3 days post-RSV challenge and subsequently analyzed for the protein levels of the chemokines CXCL10, CCL11, CCL17, and CCL22 by ELISA. Figure 11 shows that, like before, low numbers of F85-specific CD8 T cells in DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice were unable to decrease the protein levels of CCL17 and CCL22 in the lung as compared to DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacv?-gal immunized mice. However, in DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice, where there are a higher total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells, there are significant decreases ( p <0.05) in the levels of CCL17 and CCL22 protein in the lung ( Figure 11 ). Interestingly, as observed with M282-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice (see Figure 8 ), there are no significant decreases ( p >0.05) in protein levels of CXCL10 or CCL11 in DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 11 ). These data strongly suggest that a critical number of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells are required to alter the pulmonary chemokine environment and prevent the development of pulmonary eosinophilia. M2<sub>82</sub>-specific CD8 T cells inhibit vacvF-induced pulmonary eosinophilia via an IFN-?-independent mechanism BALB/c mice immunized with vacvF do not develop pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 19 , 20 ). However, IFN-?-deficient mice immunized with vacvF develop pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 19 , 20 ). These data suggest that F85-specific CD8 T cells inhibit vacvF-induced pulmonary eosinophilia by an IFN-?-dependent mechanism. We have previously demonstrated that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells inhibit vacvG-induced pulmonary eosinophilia via an IFN-?-independent mechanism ( 7 ). Thus, it appears that there are differences in the requirements for IFN-? based on the CD8 T cell population responding to the challenge as well as the immunization (i.e. either vacvG or vacvF). Therefore, we asked if M282-specific memory CD8 T cells could inhibit vacvF-induced pulmonary eosinophilia in the absence of IFN-?. BALB/c IFN-?-deficient mice were immunized with vacv?-gal, vacvF plus vacv?-gal, vacvM2 plus vacv?-gal, or vacvF plus vacvM2 and three weeks later intranasaly challenged with RSV. Figure 12 demonstrates that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells decrease the total number of eosinophils in the BAL 7 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 12A ). Again, as depicted in Figure 12B , there are similar total numbers of RSV-specific CD8 T cells in mice immunized with vacvF plus vacv?-gal, vacvM2 plus vacv?-gal, or vacvF plus vacvM2 at day 7 post-RSV challenge. These data suggest that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells can inhibit pulmonary eosinophilia independent of IFN-? and the manner of immunization.  Results RSV-specific T cell responses in vacv-immunized mice Previous work has demonstrated that RSV M282-specific memory CD8 T cells inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of either vacvG- or FI-RSV-immunized mice ( 7 , 14 ). The F protein of RSV elicits a subdominant CD8 T cell response directed against amino acids 85?93 ( 15 ). It is currently unclear if F85-specific memory CD8 T cells can inhibit vacvG-induced pulmonary eosinophilia. Mice immunized with a 1:1 ratio of either vacvG and vacvF (vacvG plus vacvF) or vacvG and vacvM2 (vacvG plus vacvM2) induced a similar total number of antigen-specific CD8 T cells 7 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 1A, B ). With similar total numbers of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells, we predicted that F85-specific CD8 T cells would inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia in vacvG-immunized mice. Surprisingly, vacvG plus vacv?-gal- and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice developed similar frequencies ( Figure 1C ) and total numbers ( Figure 1D ) of eosinophils in the BAL 7 days post-RSV challenge, whereas, mice immunized with vacvG plus vacvM2 exhibited a significant reduction ( p <0.05) in both the frequency and the total number of eosinophils in the BAL at this time ( Figure 1C, D ). As previously described ( 7 ), only vacvG plus vacvM2- and not vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice demonstrated a significant decrease ( p <0.05) in the total number of G183-specific CD4 T cells ( Figure 1E ). As expected only mice immunized with either vacvG plus vacvF or vacvF alone mounted an enhanced F51-specific CD4 and F85-specific CD8 T cell response ( Figure 1A, F ). Furthermore, only vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice exhibited an increased total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells over the acute (i.e. vacv?-gal-immunized) RSV response ( Figure 1B ). M2<sub>82</sub>-specific but not F<sub>85</sub>-specific CD8 T cells inhibit the V?14<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cell response Immunization of BALB/c mice with vacvG induces an oligoclonal V?14+ CD4 T cell population that is required for the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 8 , 22 ). Previously, we have demonstrated that RSV M282-specific CD8 T cells inhibit the total number of CD4 as well as V?14+ CD4 T cells in the lung after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice ( 7 ). Having shown that F85-specific CD8 T cells do not inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice; we next asked if these cells were also unable to inhibit the expansion of CD4 and V?14+ CD4 T cells in the lung after RSV challenge. Figure 2 demonstrates that only mice immunized with vacvG plus vacvM2 and not vacvG plus vacvF exhibited a significantly reduced ( p <0.05) total number of CD4 ( Figure 2A ) and V?14+ CD4 T cells ( Figure 2B ) in the lung after RSV challenge. Viral clearance in immunized mice We analyzed virus clearance to determine its potential role in the differential development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of mice previously immunized with either vacvG plus vacvF or vacvG plus vacvM2. All immunized mice had significantly decreased ( p <0.05) viral titers at both day 4 and day 7 post-RSV challenge as compared to vacv?-gal immunized mice that do not mount an RSV-specific memory T cell response ( Figure 3 ). Additionally, both vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice, which undergo both memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, had significantly reduced ( p <0.05) viral titers in their lungs as compared to vacvG plus vacv?-gal-immunized mice at day 4 post-RSV challenge. However, there was no significant difference ( p >0.05) in the viral titers in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice at day 4 post-RSV challenge, suggesting that differential clearance of the virus does not account for the difference in pulmonary eosinophilia exhibited by these mice (see Figure 1 ). F<sub>85</sub>-specific CD8 T cells fail to inhibit FI-RSV-induced vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia We have previously demonstrated that induction of an M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response in FI-RSV-immunized mice inhibits the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 7 ). The pulmonary eosinophilia that occurs after RSV challenge of FI-RSV-immunized mice is independent of the oligoclonal V?14+ CD4 T cell expansion that is required for the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice ( 11 ). We have shown (see Figure 2 ) that only M282-specific and not F85-specific memory CD8 T cells reduce the total number of V?14+ CD4 T cells in the lung after RSV challenge of vacvG plus vacvM2- and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice, respectively. Therefore it remained possible that F85-specific memory CD8 T cells could inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of FI-RSV- but not vacvG-immunized mice. To determine if F85-specific memory CD8 T cells can inhibit pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of FI-RSV-immunized mice, mice were either mock treated or immunized intramuscularly with FI-RSV. Four weeks after initial priming, mice were subsequently immunized with vacv?-gal, vacvF, or vacvM2 prior to intranasal challenge with RSV after an additional 4 weeks. Figure 4 demonstrates that only FI-RSV-immunized mice co-immunized with vacvM2 and not vacvF have significantly reduced ( p <0.05) total numbers ( Figure 4A ) of eosinophils in the BAL. Similar to what we have previously observed with vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice (see Figure 1 ), there was not a significant difference ( p >0.05) in the total number of either F85- or M282-specific CD8 T cells in FI-RSV/vacvM2- and FI-RSV/vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 4B ). Function of F<sub>85</sub>- and M2<sub>82</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cells One possible reason F85-specific memory CD8 T cells are unable to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of either vacvG- or FI-RSV-immunized mice may be due to a defect in their effector function. To address this, we compared the ability of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells to produce common CD8 T cell effector cytokines (i.e. IFN-?, TNF-?, or IL-2) by ICS. Interestingly, F85-specific CD8 T cells contained a higher frequency of cells capable of co-producing the cytokines IFN-? and either TNF-? or IL-2 as compared to M282-specific CD8 T cells ( Figure 5 A, B ). Furthermore, the relative amount of IFN-?, TNF-?, and IL-2 produced, as measured by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), was greater in F85-specific CD8 T cells as compared to M282-specific CD8 T cells ( Figure 5C ). Taken together, these data suggest that F85-specific CD8 T cells exhibit at least similar if not greater cytokine production capacity as compared to their M282-specific counterparts. Kinetics of the F<sub>85</sub>- and M2<sub>82</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cell responses Although we found equivalent numbers of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lung at day 7 post-RSV challenge, it was unclear if the early kinetics of the F85- and M282-specific memory CD8 T cell responses were similar. Therefore, we examined the total number of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lung prior to and at various time points after RSV challenge. Figure 6 demonstrates that prior to RSV challenge (21 days post-vacv-immunization) there are significantly greater ( p <0.05, 3?4 fold) total numbers of M282-specific CD8 T cells in the spleen, blood, inguinal lymph nodes, and lungs of vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice ( Figure 6A ) as compared to F85-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice. Furthermore, there are significantly ( p <0.05) more M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice as compared to the number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice 3 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 6B ). Consistent with the data presented in Figure 1 , the total number of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells at day 7 post-RSV challenge is not significantly different ( p >0.05, Figure 6B ). These results suggest that the total number of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung at early time points after RSV challenge may be a critical determinant to the inhibition of pulmonary eosinophilia. We next asked if this discrepancy between the early kinetics of the F85- and M282-specific memory CD8 T cell responses could account for their differential ability to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia. We therefore altered the magnitude of the M282-specific memory response by immunizing mice with a ratio of 200:1 vacvG to vacvM2 (200 vacvG:vacvM2) in an attempt to match the early kinetics of the F85-specific CD8 T cell response. Figure 7 demonstrates that the total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice at 3 days post-RSV challenge is 3?4 fold greater than the total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 7A ). Mice immunized with 200 vacvG:vacvM2 had an equivalent total number of M282-specifc cells in the lung as compared to the total number of F85-specific cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice 3 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 7A ). As shown above, at day 7 post-RSV challenge, there were similar total numbers of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice, respectively ( Figure 7B ). Importantly, there were substantially more M282-specific CD8 T cells in 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice as compared to vacv?-gal-immunized mice, indicating that we successfully primed a M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response ( Figure 7B ). However, the M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response in 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice is significantly reduced (?2?3-fold, p <0.05) as compared to vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice at day 7 post-RSV challenge ( Figure 7B ). Mice immunized with vacvG plus vacv?-gal have a robust RSV G183-specific CD4 T cell response at day 7 after RSV challenge ( Figure 7C ). This G183-specific CD4 T cell response is significantly reduced ( p <0.05) in mice undergoing a concurrent M282-specific, but not a concurrent F85-specific, memory CD8 T cell response ( Figure 7C ). Interestingly, when we equalized the M282- and F85-specific response at day 3 post-RSV challenge by immunizing mice with 200 vacvG:vacvM2 ( Figure 7A ) we observed a significant increase ( p <0.05) in the total number of G183-specific CD4 T cells at day 7 after RSV challenge. As demonstrated above, mice immunized with vacvG plus vacv?-gal and vacvG plus vacvF have similar total numbers ( Figure 7D ) of eosinophils and this is significantly reduced ( p <0.05) in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice after RSV challenge ( Figure 7D ). Interestingly, 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice have similar levels of pulmonary eosinophilia as compared to vacvG plus vacv?-gal- and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 7D ). To ensure that M282-specific CD8 T cells induced by vacvG plus vacvM2 and 200 vacvG:vacvM2 immunization behave similarly after RSV challenge we compared the frequency of IFN-?-producing CD8 T cells ( Figure 7E ) and the MFI of IFN-? produced by these cells by IFN-? ICS ( Figure 7F ). Figure 7E demonstrates that there is a slight decrease in the frequency of IFN-?-producing cells that is consistent with the 2- to 3-fold decrease in the total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells noted above ( Figure 7B ). Additionally, M282-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2 and 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice produce IFN-? at a similar per cell capacity as measured by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IFN-? which is significantly greater than the non-stimulated controls ( p <0.05). These data indicate that the early kinetics of entry and accumulation in the lung by RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells is a major determinant of their ability to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice. M2<sub>82</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cells alter Th2-associated chemokine levels early after RSV challenge Th2-associated chemokines are important in the development of RSV vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia ( 19 , 23 - 25 ). The production of several Th2-associated chemokines peaks early after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice ( 26 ). Therefore, we asked if either a concurrent F85- or M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response would reduce the early Th2-associated chemokine production after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice. Lungs and BAL were harvested 3 days post-RSV challenge and subsequently analyzed for protein levels of either Th1-associated (CXCL10, CCL5) or Th2-associated (CCL11, CCL17, CCL22) chemokines by ELISA. Mice immunized with vacvG, vacvG plus vacvF, vacvG plus vacvM2, or 200 vacvG:vacvM2 showed similar enhanced protein levels of all Th1-associated chemokines and interestingly the Th2-associated chemokine CCL11 in both the lung and BAL ( Figure 8A, B ). Our data also demonstrates that only M282-specific, but not F85-specific, memory CD8 T cells are able to significantly decrease ( p <0.05) protein levels of CCL17 and CCL22 in both the lung and BAL ( Figure 8A, B ). Importantly, mice immunized with 200 vacvG:vacvM2 had increased levels ( p <0.05) of CCL17 and CCL22 as compared to mice immunized with vacvG plus vacvM2, suggesting that a reduced number of M282-specific memory CD8 T cells are unable to alter the chemokine environment ( Figure 8A, B ). These data indicate that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells prevent the trafficking of Th2 cells, and possibly eosinophils, into the lung by inhibiting the early production of the Th2-associated chemokines CCL17 and CCL22. Boosting the F<sub>85</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cell response results in the inhibition of pulmonary eosinophilia Having established that reducing the total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells that enter the lung early after RSV infection results in the development of pulmonary eosinophilia ( Figure 7 ), we next asked if increasing the number of memory F85-specific CD8 T cells early after RSV challenge would result in the abrogation of pulmonary eosinophilia. Mice were immunized with 1×106 DCs that were either left untreated or coated with F85?93-peptide. After 2?3 weeks, DC-immunized mice were subesequently immunized with vacv?-gal, vacvG plus vacv?-gal, or vacvG plus vacvF and challenged with RSV after an additional 3 weeks of rest. We were unable to detect F85-specific CD8 T cells in either the peripheral blood or lungs of mice immunized with DC-F85?93 and vacv?-gal whereas we were able to detect a low number of F85-specific CD8 T cells after DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF immunization ( Figure 9A, B ). However, mice immunized with DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF exhibited a significantly greater ( p <0.05) number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in both the peripheral blood and lung 21 days post-vacv-immunization as compared to DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 9A, B ), demonstrating that we were able to boost the number of F85-specific memory CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood and lung ?5- to 10-fold. At day 3 after RSV challenge of DC and vacv-immunized mice there was a significantly ( p <0.05) greater total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice as compared to their DC-no peptide-immunized counterparts ( Figure 9B ). After RSV challenge only DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice had a significantly decreased ( p <0.05) total number of eosinophils in the lungs as compared to vacvG plus vacv?-gal immunized mice ( Figure 9C ). Interestingly, there was only a 2-to 3-fold increase ( p <0.05) in the total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells at day 7 post-RSV challenge in the lungs of DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice as compared to DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 9D ). These data demonstrate that F85-specific memory CD8 T cells are capable of inhibiting the development of pulmonary eosinophilia if present in high enough numbers at the time of and/or early after RSV challenge. Furthermore, these data provide strong evidence that both the total numbers and early kinetics of entry into the lung of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells are critical for the control of RSV vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia. Characteristics of F<sub>85</sub>-specific CD8 T cells in DC- and vacv-immunized mice One drawback to utilizing the DC prime and boost methodology described above to increase the total number of F85-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung is that the resultant cells are now secondary memory cells, as compared to primary memory cells generated after vacvG plus vacvF immunization. Consequently, the F85-specific secondary memory CD8 T cells may differ in their phenotypic or functional characteristics. To address this issue, we examined the functional and phenotypic characteristics of F85-specific memory CD8 T cells at day 21 after vacvG plus vacvF immunization of mice previously immunized with DCs that were either left untreated or coated with F85?93 peptide. DC-no peptide-immunized mice exhibited a greater frequency of cells expressing CD62L, but not TNF-? or IL-2 as compared to mice immunized with DC-F85?93 ( Table 1 ). However, after RSV challenge of mice previously immunized with either DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF- or DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF, F85-specific primary and secondary memory CD8 T cells exhibited similar functional avidity ( Figure 10A ), degranulation, as determined by Lamp 1/2 staining ( Figure 10B ) and similar expression of intracellular granzyme B ( Figure 10C ). However, there was a difference in the ability of these cells to produce the cytokines TNF-? and IL-2 ( Figure 10D, E ). These data suggest that although there are some phenotypical and functional differences in F85-specific cells in DC-no peptide and DC-F85?93-immunized mice, these differences are relatively small and are unlikely to greatly alter their ability to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia. F<sub>85</sub>-specific CD8 T cells, when present at sufficient numbers early after RSV challenge, alter the pulmonary chemokine environment As demonstrated above, M282-specific memory CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice are present at higher numbers early after RSV challenge as compared to F85-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figures 6 and 7 ). Additionally, these M282-specific CD8 T cells are able to alter the pulmonary chemokine environment whereas the F85-specific CD8 T cells, that are present at lower numbers, are not ( Figure 8 ). To determine if increasing the total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells by DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF immunization (see Figure 9 ) would also alter the pulmonary chemokine environment, DC- and vacv-immunized mice were harvested 3 days post-RSV challenge and subsequently analyzed for the protein levels of the chemokines CXCL10, CCL11, CCL17, and CCL22 by ELISA. Figure 11 shows that, like before, low numbers of F85-specific CD8 T cells in DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice were unable to decrease the protein levels of CCL17 and CCL22 in the lung as compared to DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacv?-gal immunized mice. However, in DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice, where there are a higher total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells, there are significant decreases ( p <0.05) in the levels of CCL17 and CCL22 protein in the lung ( Figure 11 ). Interestingly, as observed with M282-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice (see Figure 8 ), there are no significant decreases ( p >0.05) in protein levels of CXCL10 or CCL11 in DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 11 ). These data strongly suggest that a critical number of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells are required to alter the pulmonary chemokine environment and prevent the development of pulmonary eosinophilia. M2<sub>82</sub>-specific CD8 T cells inhibit vacvF-induced pulmonary eosinophilia via an IFN-?-independent mechanism BALB/c mice immunized with vacvF do not develop pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 19 , 20 ). However, IFN-?-deficient mice immunized with vacvF develop pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 19 , 20 ). These data suggest that F85-specific CD8 T cells inhibit vacvF-induced pulmonary eosinophilia by an IFN-?-dependent mechanism. We have previously demonstrated that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells inhibit vacvG-induced pulmonary eosinophilia via an IFN-?-independent mechanism ( 7 ). Thus, it appears that there are differences in the requirements for IFN-? based on the CD8 T cell population responding to the challenge as well as the immunization (i.e. either vacvG or vacvF). Therefore, we asked if M282-specific memory CD8 T cells could inhibit vacvF-induced pulmonary eosinophilia in the absence of IFN-?. BALB/c IFN-?-deficient mice were immunized with vacv?-gal, vacvF plus vacv?-gal, vacvM2 plus vacv?-gal, or vacvF plus vacvM2 and three weeks later intranasaly challenged with RSV. Figure 12 demonstrates that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells decrease the total number of eosinophils in the BAL 7 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 12A ). Again, as depicted in Figure 12B , there are similar total numbers of RSV-specific CD8 T cells in mice immunized with vacvF plus vacv?-gal, vacvM2 plus vacv?-gal, or vacvF plus vacvM2 at day 7 post-RSV challenge. These data suggest that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells can inhibit pulmonary eosinophilia independent of IFN-? and the manner of immunization.  RSV-specific T cell responses in vacv-immunized mice Previous work has demonstrated that RSV M282-specific memory CD8 T cells inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of either vacvG- or FI-RSV-immunized mice ( 7 , 14 ). The F protein of RSV elicits a subdominant CD8 T cell response directed against amino acids 85?93 ( 15 ). It is currently unclear if F85-specific memory CD8 T cells can inhibit vacvG-induced pulmonary eosinophilia. Mice immunized with a 1:1 ratio of either vacvG and vacvF (vacvG plus vacvF) or vacvG and vacvM2 (vacvG plus vacvM2) induced a similar total number of antigen-specific CD8 T cells 7 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 1A, B ). With similar total numbers of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells, we predicted that F85-specific CD8 T cells would inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia in vacvG-immunized mice. Surprisingly, vacvG plus vacv?-gal- and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice developed similar frequencies ( Figure 1C ) and total numbers ( Figure 1D ) of eosinophils in the BAL 7 days post-RSV challenge, whereas, mice immunized with vacvG plus vacvM2 exhibited a significant reduction ( p <0.05) in both the frequency and the total number of eosinophils in the BAL at this time ( Figure 1C, D ). As previously described ( 7 ), only vacvG plus vacvM2- and not vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice demonstrated a significant decrease ( p <0.05) in the total number of G183-specific CD4 T cells ( Figure 1E ). As expected only mice immunized with either vacvG plus vacvF or vacvF alone mounted an enhanced F51-specific CD4 and F85-specific CD8 T cell response ( Figure 1A, F ). Furthermore, only vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice exhibited an increased total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells over the acute (i.e. vacv?-gal-immunized) RSV response ( Figure 1B ).  RSV-specific T cell responses in vacv-immunized mice Previous work has demonstrated that RSV M282-specific memory CD8 T cells inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of either vacvG- or FI-RSV-immunized mice ( 7 , 14 ). The F protein of RSV elicits a subdominant CD8 T cell response directed against amino acids 85?93 ( 15 ). It is currently unclear if F85-specific memory CD8 T cells can inhibit vacvG-induced pulmonary eosinophilia. Mice immunized with a 1:1 ratio of either vacvG and vacvF (vacvG plus vacvF) or vacvG and vacvM2 (vacvG plus vacvM2) induced a similar total number of antigen-specific CD8 T cells 7 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 1A, B ). With similar total numbers of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells, we predicted that F85-specific CD8 T cells would inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia in vacvG-immunized mice. Surprisingly, vacvG plus vacv?-gal- and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice developed similar frequencies ( Figure 1C ) and total numbers ( Figure 1D ) of eosinophils in the BAL 7 days post-RSV challenge, whereas, mice immunized with vacvG plus vacvM2 exhibited a significant reduction ( p <0.05) in both the frequency and the total number of eosinophils in the BAL at this time ( Figure 1C, D ). As previously described ( 7 ), only vacvG plus vacvM2- and not vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice demonstrated a significant decrease ( p <0.05) in the total number of G183-specific CD4 T cells ( Figure 1E ). As expected only mice immunized with either vacvG plus vacvF or vacvF alone mounted an enhanced F51-specific CD4 and F85-specific CD8 T cell response ( Figure 1A, F ). Furthermore, only vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice exhibited an increased total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells over the acute (i.e. vacv?-gal-immunized) RSV response ( Figure 1B ).  M2<sub>82</sub>-specific but not F<sub>85</sub>-specific CD8 T cells inhibit the V?14<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cell response Immunization of BALB/c mice with vacvG induces an oligoclonal V?14+ CD4 T cell population that is required for the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 8 , 22 ). Previously, we have demonstrated that RSV M282-specific CD8 T cells inhibit the total number of CD4 as well as V?14+ CD4 T cells in the lung after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice ( 7 ). Having shown that F85-specific CD8 T cells do not inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice; we next asked if these cells were also unable to inhibit the expansion of CD4 and V?14+ CD4 T cells in the lung after RSV challenge. Figure 2 demonstrates that only mice immunized with vacvG plus vacvM2 and not vacvG plus vacvF exhibited a significantly reduced ( p <0.05) total number of CD4 ( Figure 2A ) and V?14+ CD4 T cells ( Figure 2B ) in the lung after RSV challenge.  M2<sub>82</sub>-specific but not F<sub>85</sub>-specific CD8 T cells inhibit the V?14<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cell response Immunization of BALB/c mice with vacvG induces an oligoclonal V?14+ CD4 T cell population that is required for the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 8 , 22 ). Previously, we have demonstrated that RSV M282-specific CD8 T cells inhibit the total number of CD4 as well as V?14+ CD4 T cells in the lung after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice ( 7 ). Having shown that F85-specific CD8 T cells do not inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice; we next asked if these cells were also unable to inhibit the expansion of CD4 and V?14+ CD4 T cells in the lung after RSV challenge. Figure 2 demonstrates that only mice immunized with vacvG plus vacvM2 and not vacvG plus vacvF exhibited a significantly reduced ( p <0.05) total number of CD4 ( Figure 2A ) and V?14+ CD4 T cells ( Figure 2B ) in the lung after RSV challenge.  Viral clearance in immunized mice We analyzed virus clearance to determine its potential role in the differential development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of mice previously immunized with either vacvG plus vacvF or vacvG plus vacvM2. All immunized mice had significantly decreased ( p <0.05) viral titers at both day 4 and day 7 post-RSV challenge as compared to vacv?-gal immunized mice that do not mount an RSV-specific memory T cell response ( Figure 3 ). Additionally, both vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice, which undergo both memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, had significantly reduced ( p <0.05) viral titers in their lungs as compared to vacvG plus vacv?-gal-immunized mice at day 4 post-RSV challenge. However, there was no significant difference ( p >0.05) in the viral titers in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice at day 4 post-RSV challenge, suggesting that differential clearance of the virus does not account for the difference in pulmonary eosinophilia exhibited by these mice (see Figure 1 ).  Viral clearance in immunized mice We analyzed virus clearance to determine its potential role in the differential development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of mice previously immunized with either vacvG plus vacvF or vacvG plus vacvM2. All immunized mice had significantly decreased ( p <0.05) viral titers at both day 4 and day 7 post-RSV challenge as compared to vacv?-gal immunized mice that do not mount an RSV-specific memory T cell response ( Figure 3 ). Additionally, both vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice, which undergo both memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, had significantly reduced ( p <0.05) viral titers in their lungs as compared to vacvG plus vacv?-gal-immunized mice at day 4 post-RSV challenge. However, there was no significant difference ( p >0.05) in the viral titers in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice at day 4 post-RSV challenge, suggesting that differential clearance of the virus does not account for the difference in pulmonary eosinophilia exhibited by these mice (see Figure 1 ).  F<sub>85</sub>-specific CD8 T cells fail to inhibit FI-RSV-induced vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia We have previously demonstrated that induction of an M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response in FI-RSV-immunized mice inhibits the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 7 ). The pulmonary eosinophilia that occurs after RSV challenge of FI-RSV-immunized mice is independent of the oligoclonal V?14+ CD4 T cell expansion that is required for the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice ( 11 ). We have shown (see Figure 2 ) that only M282-specific and not F85-specific memory CD8 T cells reduce the total number of V?14+ CD4 T cells in the lung after RSV challenge of vacvG plus vacvM2- and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice, respectively. Therefore it remained possible that F85-specific memory CD8 T cells could inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of FI-RSV- but not vacvG-immunized mice. To determine if F85-specific memory CD8 T cells can inhibit pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of FI-RSV-immunized mice, mice were either mock treated or immunized intramuscularly with FI-RSV. Four weeks after initial priming, mice were subsequently immunized with vacv?-gal, vacvF, or vacvM2 prior to intranasal challenge with RSV after an additional 4 weeks. Figure 4 demonstrates that only FI-RSV-immunized mice co-immunized with vacvM2 and not vacvF have significantly reduced ( p <0.05) total numbers ( Figure 4A ) of eosinophils in the BAL. Similar to what we have previously observed with vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice (see Figure 1 ), there was not a significant difference ( p >0.05) in the total number of either F85- or M282-specific CD8 T cells in FI-RSV/vacvM2- and FI-RSV/vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 4B ).  F<sub>85</sub>-specific CD8 T cells fail to inhibit FI-RSV-induced vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia We have previously demonstrated that induction of an M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response in FI-RSV-immunized mice inhibits the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 7 ). The pulmonary eosinophilia that occurs after RSV challenge of FI-RSV-immunized mice is independent of the oligoclonal V?14+ CD4 T cell expansion that is required for the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice ( 11 ). We have shown (see Figure 2 ) that only M282-specific and not F85-specific memory CD8 T cells reduce the total number of V?14+ CD4 T cells in the lung after RSV challenge of vacvG plus vacvM2- and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice, respectively. Therefore it remained possible that F85-specific memory CD8 T cells could inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of FI-RSV- but not vacvG-immunized mice. To determine if F85-specific memory CD8 T cells can inhibit pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of FI-RSV-immunized mice, mice were either mock treated or immunized intramuscularly with FI-RSV. Four weeks after initial priming, mice were subsequently immunized with vacv?-gal, vacvF, or vacvM2 prior to intranasal challenge with RSV after an additional 4 weeks. Figure 4 demonstrates that only FI-RSV-immunized mice co-immunized with vacvM2 and not vacvF have significantly reduced ( p <0.05) total numbers ( Figure 4A ) of eosinophils in the BAL. Similar to what we have previously observed with vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice (see Figure 1 ), there was not a significant difference ( p >0.05) in the total number of either F85- or M282-specific CD8 T cells in FI-RSV/vacvM2- and FI-RSV/vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 4B ).  Function of F<sub>85</sub>- and M2<sub>82</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cells One possible reason F85-specific memory CD8 T cells are unable to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of either vacvG- or FI-RSV-immunized mice may be due to a defect in their effector function. To address this, we compared the ability of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells to produce common CD8 T cell effector cytokines (i.e. IFN-?, TNF-?, or IL-2) by ICS. Interestingly, F85-specific CD8 T cells contained a higher frequency of cells capable of co-producing the cytokines IFN-? and either TNF-? or IL-2 as compared to M282-specific CD8 T cells ( Figure 5 A, B ). Furthermore, the relative amount of IFN-?, TNF-?, and IL-2 produced, as measured by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), was greater in F85-specific CD8 T cells as compared to M282-specific CD8 T cells ( Figure 5C ). Taken together, these data suggest that F85-specific CD8 T cells exhibit at least similar if not greater cytokine production capacity as compared to their M282-specific counterparts.  Function of F<sub>85</sub>- and M2<sub>82</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cells One possible reason F85-specific memory CD8 T cells are unable to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of either vacvG- or FI-RSV-immunized mice may be due to a defect in their effector function. To address this, we compared the ability of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells to produce common CD8 T cell effector cytokines (i.e. IFN-?, TNF-?, or IL-2) by ICS.

Furthermore, the relative amount of IFN-?, TNF-?, and IL-2 produced, as measured by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), was greater in F85-specific CD8 T cells as compared to M282-specific CD8 T cells ( Figure 5C ). Taken together, these data suggest that F85-specific CD8 T cells exhibit at least similar if not greater cytokine production capacity as compared to their M282-specific counterparts.  Kinetics of the F<sub>85</sub>- and M2<sub>82</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cell responses Although we found equivalent numbers of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lung at day 7 post-RSV challenge, it was unclear if the early kinetics of the F85- and M282-specific memory CD8 T cell responses were similar. Therefore, we examined the total number of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lung prior to and at various time points after RSV challenge. Figure 6 demonstrates that prior to RSV challenge (21 days post-vacv-immunization) there are significantly greater ( p <0.05, 3?4 fold) total numbers of M282-specific CD8 T cells in the spleen, blood, inguinal lymph nodes, and lungs of vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice ( Figure 6A ) as compared to F85-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice. Furthermore, there are significantly ( p <0.05) more M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice as compared to the number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice 3 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 6B ). Consistent with the data presented in Figure 1 , the total number of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells at day 7 post-RSV challenge is not significantly different ( p >0.05, Figure 6B ). These results suggest that the total number of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung at early time points after RSV challenge may be a critical determinant to the inhibition of pulmonary eosinophilia. We next asked if this discrepancy between the early kinetics of the F85- and M282-specific memory CD8 T cell responses could account for their differential ability to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia. We therefore altered the magnitude of the M282-specific memory response by immunizing mice with a ratio of 200:1 vacvG to vacvM2 (200 vacvG:vacvM2) in an attempt to match the early kinetics of the F85-specific CD8 T cell response. Figure 7 demonstrates that the total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice at 3 days post-RSV challenge is 3?4 fold greater than the total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 7A ). Mice immunized with 200 vacvG:vacvM2 had an equivalent total number of M282-specifc cells in the lung as compared to the total number of F85-specific cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice 3 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 7A ). As shown above, at day 7 post-RSV challenge, there were similar total numbers of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice, respectively ( Figure 7B ). Importantly, there were substantially more M282-specific CD8 T cells in 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice as compared to vacv?-gal-immunized mice, indicating that we successfully primed a M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response ( Figure 7B ). However, the M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response in 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice is significantly reduced (?2?3-fold, p <0.05) as compared to vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice at day 7 post-RSV challenge ( Figure 7B ). Mice immunized with vacvG plus vacv?-gal have a robust RSV G183-specific CD4 T cell response at day 7 after RSV challenge ( Figure 7C ). This G183-specific CD4 T cell response is significantly reduced ( p <0.05) in mice undergoing a concurrent M282-specific, but not a concurrent F85-specific, memory CD8 T cell response ( Figure 7C ). Interestingly, when we equalized the M282- and F85-specific response at day 3 post-RSV challenge by immunizing mice with 200 vacvG:vacvM2 ( Figure 7A ) we observed a significant increase ( p <0.05) in the total number of G183-specific CD4 T cells at day 7 after RSV challenge. As demonstrated above, mice immunized with vacvG plus vacv?-gal and vacvG plus vacvF have similar total numbers ( Figure 7D ) of eosinophils and this is significantly reduced ( p <0.05) in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice after RSV challenge ( Figure 7D ). Interestingly, 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice have similar levels of pulmonary eosinophilia as compared to vacvG plus vacv?-gal- and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 7D ). To ensure that M282-specific CD8 T cells induced by vacvG plus vacvM2 and 200 vacvG:vacvM2 immunization behave similarly after RSV challenge we compared the frequency of IFN-?-producing CD8 T cells ( Figure 7E ) and the MFI of IFN-? produced by these cells by IFN-? ICS ( Figure 7F ). Figure 7E demonstrates that there is a slight decrease in the frequency of IFN-?-producing cells that is consistent with the 2- to 3-fold decrease in the total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells noted above ( Figure 7B ). Additionally, M282-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2 and 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice produce IFN-? at a similar per cell capacity as measured by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IFN-? which is significantly greater than the non-stimulated controls ( p <0.05). These data indicate that the early kinetics of entry and accumulation in the lung by RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells is a major determinant of their ability to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice.  Kinetics of the F<sub>85</sub>- and M2<sub>82</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cell responses Although we found equivalent numbers of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lung at day 7 post-RSV challenge, it was unclear if the early kinetics of the F85- and M282-specific memory CD8 T cell responses were similar. Therefore, we examined the total number of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lung prior to and at various time points after RSV challenge. Figure 6 demonstrates that prior to RSV challenge (21 days post-vacv-immunization) there are significantly greater ( p <0.05, 3?4 fold) total numbers of M282-specific CD8 T cells in the spleen, blood, inguinal lymph nodes, and lungs of vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice ( Figure 6A ) as compared to F85-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice. Furthermore, there are significantly ( p <0.05) more M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice as compared to the number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice 3 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 6B ). Consistent with the data presented in Figure 1 , the total number of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells at day 7 post-RSV challenge is not significantly different ( p >0.05, Figure 6B ). These results suggest that the total number of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung at early time points after RSV challenge may be a critical determinant to the inhibition of pulmonary eosinophilia. We next asked if this discrepancy between the early kinetics of the F85- and M282-specific memory CD8 T cell responses could account for their differential ability to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia. We therefore altered the magnitude of the M282-specific memory response by immunizing mice with a ratio of 200:1 vacvG to vacvM2 (200 vacvG:vacvM2) in an attempt to match the early kinetics of the F85-specific CD8 T cell response. Figure 7 demonstrates that the total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice at 3 days post-RSV challenge is 3?4 fold greater than the total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 7A ). Mice immunized with 200 vacvG:vacvM2 had an equivalent total number of M282-specifc cells in the lung as compared to the total number of F85-specific cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice 3 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 7A ). As shown above, at day 7 post-RSV challenge, there were similar total numbers of F85- and M282-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice, respectively ( Figure 7B ). Importantly, there were substantially more M282-specific CD8 T cells in 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice as compared to vacv?-gal-immunized mice, indicating that we successfully primed a M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response ( Figure 7B ). However, the M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response in 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice is significantly reduced (?2?3-fold, p <0.05) as compared to vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice at day 7 post-RSV challenge ( Figure 7B ). Mice immunized with vacvG plus vacv?-gal have a robust RSV G183-specific CD4 T cell response at day 7 after RSV challenge ( Figure 7C ). This G183-specific CD4 T cell response is significantly reduced ( p <0.05) in mice undergoing a concurrent M282-specific, but not a concurrent F85-specific, memory CD8 T cell response ( Figure 7C ). Interestingly, when we equalized the M282- and F85-specific response at day 3 post-RSV challenge by immunizing mice with 200 vacvG:vacvM2 ( Figure 7A ) we observed a significant increase ( p <0.05) in the total number of G183-specific CD4 T cells at day 7 after RSV challenge. As demonstrated above, mice immunized with vacvG plus vacv?-gal and vacvG plus vacvF have similar total numbers ( Figure 7D ) of eosinophils and this is significantly reduced ( p <0.05) in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice after RSV challenge ( Figure 7D ). Interestingly, 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice have similar levels of pulmonary eosinophilia as compared to vacvG plus vacv?-gal- and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 7D ). To ensure that M282-specific CD8 T cells induced by vacvG plus vacvM2 and 200 vacvG:vacvM2 immunization behave similarly after RSV challenge we compared the frequency of IFN-?-producing CD8 T cells ( Figure 7E ) and the MFI of IFN-? produced by these cells by IFN-? ICS ( Figure 7F ). Figure 7E demonstrates that there is a slight decrease in the frequency of IFN-?-producing cells that is consistent with the 2- to 3-fold decrease in the total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells noted above ( Figure 7B ). Additionally, M282-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2 and 200 vacvG:vacvM2-immunized mice produce IFN-? at a similar per cell capacity as measured by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IFN-? which is significantly greater than the non-stimulated controls ( p <0.05). These data indicate that the early kinetics of entry and accumulation in the lung by RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells is a major determinant of their ability to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice.  M2<sub>82</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cells alter Th2-associated chemokine levels early after RSV challenge Th2-associated chemokines are important in the development of RSV vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia ( 19 , 23 - 25 ). The production of several Th2-associated chemokines peaks early after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice ( 26 ). Therefore, we asked if either a concurrent F85- or M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response would reduce the early Th2-associated chemokine production after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice. Lungs and BAL were harvested 3 days post-RSV challenge and subsequently analyzed for protein levels of either Th1-associated (CXCL10, CCL5) or Th2-associated (CCL11, CCL17, CCL22) chemokines by ELISA. Mice immunized with vacvG, vacvG plus vacvF, vacvG plus vacvM2, or 200 vacvG:vacvM2 showed similar enhanced protein levels of all Th1-associated chemokines and interestingly the Th2-associated chemokine CCL11 in both the lung and BAL ( Figure 8A, B ). Our data also demonstrates that only M282-specific, but not F85-specific, memory CD8 T cells are able to significantly decrease ( p <0.05) protein levels of CCL17 and CCL22 in both the lung and BAL ( Figure 8A, B ). Importantly, mice immunized with 200 vacvG:vacvM2 had increased levels ( p <0.05) of CCL17 and CCL22 as compared to mice immunized with vacvG plus vacvM2, suggesting that a reduced number of M282-specific memory CD8 T cells are unable to alter the chemokine environment ( Figure 8A, B ). These data indicate that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells prevent the trafficking of Th2 cells, and possibly eosinophils, into the lung by inhibiting the early production of the Th2-associated chemokines CCL17 and CCL22.  M2<sub>82</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cells alter Th2-associated chemokine levels early after RSV challenge Th2-associated chemokines are important in the development of RSV vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia ( 19 , 23 - 25 ).

These data indicate that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells prevent the trafficking of Th2 cells, and possibly eosinophils, into the lung by inhibiting the early production of the Th2-associated chemokines CCL17 and CCL22.  Boosting the F<sub>85</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cell response results in the inhibition of pulmonary eosinophilia Having established that reducing the total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells that enter the lung early after RSV infection results in the development of pulmonary eosinophilia ( Figure 7 ), we next asked if increasing the number of memory F85-specific CD8 T cells early after RSV challenge would result in the abrogation of pulmonary eosinophilia. Mice were immunized with 1×106 DCs that were either left untreated or coated with F85?93-peptide. After 2?3 weeks, DC-immunized mice were subesequently immunized with vacv?-gal, vacvG plus vacv?-gal, or vacvG plus vacvF and challenged with RSV after an additional 3 weeks of rest. We were unable to detect F85-specific CD8 T cells in either the peripheral blood or lungs of mice immunized with DC-F85?93 and vacv?-gal whereas we were able to detect a low number of F85-specific CD8 T cells after DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF immunization ( Figure 9A, B ). However, mice immunized with DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF exhibited a significantly greater ( p <0.05) number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in both the peripheral blood and lung 21 days post-vacv-immunization as compared to DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 9A, B ), demonstrating that we were able to boost the number of F85-specific memory CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood and lung ?5- to 10-fold. At day 3 after RSV challenge of DC and vacv-immunized mice there was a significantly ( p <0.05) greater total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice as compared to their DC-no peptide-immunized counterparts ( Figure 9B ). After RSV challenge only DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice had a significantly decreased ( p <0.05) total number of eosinophils in the lungs as compared to vacvG plus vacv?-gal immunized mice ( Figure 9C ). Interestingly, there was only a 2-to 3-fold increase ( p <0.05) in the total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells at day 7 post-RSV challenge in the lungs of DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice as compared to DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 9D ). These data demonstrate that F85-specific memory CD8 T cells are capable of inhibiting the development of pulmonary eosinophilia if present in high enough numbers at the time of and/or early after RSV challenge. Furthermore, these data provide strong evidence that both the total numbers and early kinetics of entry into the lung of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells are critical for the control of RSV vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia.  Boosting the F<sub>85</sub>-specific memory CD8 T cell response results in the inhibition of pulmonary eosinophilia Having established that reducing the total number of M282-specific CD8 T cells that enter the lung early after RSV infection results in the development of pulmonary eosinophilia ( Figure 7 ), we next asked if increasing the number of memory F85-specific CD8 T cells early after RSV challenge would result in the abrogation of pulmonary eosinophilia.

However, mice immunized with DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF exhibited a significantly greater ( p <0.05) number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in both the peripheral blood and lung 21 days post-vacv-immunization as compared to DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 9A, B ), demonstrating that we were able to boost the number of F85-specific memory CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood and lung ?5- to 10-fold. At day 3 after RSV challenge of DC and vacv-immunized mice there was a significantly ( p <0.05) greater total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs of DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice as compared to their DC-no peptide-immunized counterparts ( Figure 9B ). After RSV challenge only DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice had a significantly decreased ( p <0.05) total number of eosinophils in the lungs as compared to vacvG plus vacv?-gal immunized mice ( Figure 9C ). Interestingly, there was only a 2-to 3-fold increase ( p <0.05) in the total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells at day 7 post-RSV challenge in the lungs of DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice as compared to DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 9D ). These data demonstrate that F85-specific memory CD8 T cells are capable of inhibiting the development of pulmonary eosinophilia if present in high enough numbers at the time of and/or early after RSV challenge. Furthermore, these data provide strong evidence that both the total numbers and early kinetics of entry into the lung of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells are critical for the control of RSV vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia.  Characteristics of F<sub>85</sub>-specific CD8 T cells in DC- and vacv-immunized mice One drawback to utilizing the DC prime and boost methodology described above to increase the total number of F85-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung is that the resultant cells are now secondary memory cells, as compared to primary memory cells generated after vacvG plus vacvF immunization. Consequently, the F85-specific secondary memory CD8 T cells may differ in their phenotypic or functional characteristics. To address this issue, we examined the functional and phenotypic characteristics of F85-specific memory CD8 T cells at day 21 after vacvG plus vacvF immunization of mice previously immunized with DCs that were either left untreated or coated with F85?93 peptide. DC-no peptide-immunized mice exhibited a greater frequency of cells expressing CD62L, but not TNF-? or IL-2 as compared to mice immunized with DC-F85?93 ( Table 1 ). However, after RSV challenge of mice previously immunized with either DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF- or DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF, F85-specific primary and secondary memory CD8 T cells exhibited similar functional avidity ( Figure 10A ), degranulation, as determined by Lamp 1/2 staining ( Figure 10B ) and similar expression of intracellular granzyme B ( Figure 10C ). However, there was a difference in the ability of these cells to produce the cytokines TNF-? and IL-2 ( Figure 10D, E ). These data suggest that although there are some phenotypical and functional differences in F85-specific cells in DC-no peptide and DC-F85?93-immunized mice, these differences are relatively small and are unlikely to greatly alter their ability to inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia.

F<sub>85</sub>-specific CD8 T cells, when present at sufficient numbers early after RSV challenge, alter the pulmonary chemokine environment As demonstrated above, M282-specific memory CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice are present at higher numbers early after RSV challenge as compared to F85-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figures 6 and 7 ). Additionally, these M282-specific CD8 T cells are able to alter the pulmonary chemokine environment whereas the F85-specific CD8 T cells, that are present at lower numbers, are not ( Figure 8 ). To determine if increasing the total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells by DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF immunization (see Figure 9 ) would also alter the pulmonary chemokine environment, DC- and vacv-immunized mice were harvested 3 days post-RSV challenge and subsequently analyzed for the protein levels of the chemokines CXCL10, CCL11, CCL17, and CCL22 by ELISA. Figure 11 shows that, like before, low numbers of F85-specific CD8 T cells in DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice were unable to decrease the protein levels of CCL17 and CCL22 in the lung as compared to DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacv?-gal immunized mice. However, in DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice, where there are a higher total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells, there are significant decreases ( p <0.05) in the levels of CCL17 and CCL22 protein in the lung ( Figure 11 ). Interestingly, as observed with M282-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice (see Figure 8 ), there are no significant decreases ( p >0.05) in protein levels of CXCL10 or CCL11 in DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 11 ). These data strongly suggest that a critical number of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells are required to alter the pulmonary chemokine environment and prevent the development of pulmonary eosinophilia.  F<sub>85</sub>-specific CD8 T cells, when present at sufficient numbers early after RSV challenge, alter the pulmonary chemokine environment As demonstrated above, M282-specific memory CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice are present at higher numbers early after RSV challenge as compared to F85-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figures 6 and 7 ). Additionally, these M282-specific CD8 T cells are able to alter the pulmonary chemokine environment whereas the F85-specific CD8 T cells, that are present at lower numbers, are not ( Figure 8 ). To determine if increasing the total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells by DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF immunization (see Figure 9 ) would also alter the pulmonary chemokine environment, DC- and vacv-immunized mice were harvested 3 days post-RSV challenge and subsequently analyzed for the protein levels of the chemokines CXCL10, CCL11, CCL17, and CCL22 by ELISA. Figure 11 shows that, like before, low numbers of F85-specific CD8 T cells in DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice were unable to decrease the protein levels of CCL17 and CCL22 in the lung as compared to DC-no peptide and vacvG plus vacv?-gal immunized mice. However, in DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice, where there are a higher total number of F85-specific CD8 T cells, there are significant decreases ( p <0.05) in the levels of CCL17 and CCL22 protein in the lung ( Figure 11 ). Interestingly, as observed with M282-specific CD8 T cells in vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice (see Figure 8 ), there are no significant decreases ( p >0.05) in protein levels of CXCL10 or CCL11 in DC-F85?93 and vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 11 ). These data strongly suggest that a critical number of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells are required to alter the pulmonary chemokine environment and prevent the development of pulmonary eosinophilia.  M2<sub>82</sub>-specific CD8 T cells inhibit vacvF-induced pulmonary eosinophilia via an IFN-?-independent mechanism BALB/c mice immunized with vacvF do not develop pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 19 , 20 ). However, IFN-?-deficient mice immunized with vacvF develop pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 19 , 20 ). These data suggest that F85-specific CD8 T cells inhibit vacvF-induced pulmonary eosinophilia by an IFN-?-dependent mechanism. We have previously demonstrated that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells inhibit vacvG-induced pulmonary eosinophilia via an IFN-?-independent mechanism ( 7 ). Thus, it appears that there are differences in the requirements for IFN-? based on the CD8 T cell population responding to the challenge as well as the immunization (i.e. either vacvG or vacvF). Therefore, we asked if M282-specific memory CD8 T cells could inhibit vacvF-induced pulmonary eosinophilia in the absence of IFN-?. BALB/c IFN-?-deficient mice were immunized with vacv?-gal, vacvF plus vacv?-gal, vacvM2 plus vacv?-gal, or vacvF plus vacvM2 and three weeks later intranasaly challenged with RSV. Figure 12 demonstrates that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells decrease the total number of eosinophils in the BAL 7 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 12A ). Again, as depicted in Figure 12B , there are similar total numbers of RSV-specific CD8 T cells in mice immunized with vacvF plus vacv?-gal, vacvM2 plus vacv?-gal, or vacvF plus vacvM2 at day 7 post-RSV challenge. These data suggest that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells can inhibit pulmonary eosinophilia independent of IFN-? and the manner of immunization.  M2<sub>82</sub>-specific CD8 T cells inhibit vacvF-induced pulmonary eosinophilia via an IFN-?-independent mechanism BALB/c mice immunized with vacvF do not develop pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 19 , 20 ). However, IFN-?-deficient mice immunized with vacvF develop pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge ( 19 , 20 ). These data suggest that F85-specific CD8 T cells inhibit vacvF-induced pulmonary eosinophilia by an IFN-?-dependent mechanism.

BALB/c IFN-?-deficient mice were immunized with vacv?-gal, vacvF plus vacv?-gal, vacvM2 plus vacv?-gal, or vacvF plus vacvM2 and three weeks later intranasaly challenged with RSV. Figure 12 demonstrates that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells decrease the total number of eosinophils in the BAL 7 days post-RSV challenge ( Figure 12A ). Again, as depicted in Figure 12B , there are similar total numbers of RSV-specific CD8 T cells in mice immunized with vacvF plus vacv?-gal, vacvM2 plus vacv?-gal, or vacvF plus vacvM2 at day 7 post-RSV challenge. These data suggest that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells can inhibit pulmonary eosinophilia independent of IFN-? and the manner of immunization.  Discussion CD8 T cells play a prominent role in the clearance of intracellular pathogens. In addition, CD8 T cells also have been shown to inhibit pathological CD4 T cell responses ( 7 , 14 , 27 , 28 ). Previous work has established that RSV-specific CD8 T cells can inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia during RSV challenge of previously immunized mice ( 14 , 20 ). We have recently demonstrated that induction of an RSV M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response inhibits both the total number of Th2 cells and eosinophils in the lung after RSV challenge of mice previously immunized with either vacvG- or FI-RSV ( 7 ). Because the presence of Th2 cells in the lung is required to induce pulmonary eosinophilia in this model ( 29 ), these results suggest that RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells inhibit the trafficking and/or expansion of Th2 cells. In this report, we show that the ability of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells to inhibit RSV vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia is critically dependent on the total number of virus-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung early after infection. Simply decreasing the number of M282-specific CD8 T cells present in the lungs early after RSV challenge (day 3) results in the development of pulmonary eosinophilia ( Figure 7 ). Moreover, we demonstrate that memory CD8 T cells specific to the subdominant F85?93 epitope, if present in high enough numbers early after RSV challenge, also inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 9 ). However, the underlying mechanisms of how these early memory CD8 T cell responses prevent the Th2-driven eosinophilic response remain unclear. Chemokines are critical for trafficking of immune cells to sites of inflammation. Murine eosinophils and CD4 T cells have been shown to express different chemokine receptors based on their localization or functional phenotype ( 30 ). Our data indicates that the presence of a high number of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung early after RSV challenge alters the chemokine environment in the lung ( Figures 8 and 11 ). Interestingly, we observed a preferential decrease in the protein levels of CCL17 and CCL22 and no change in the levels of CCL11 ( Figures 8 and 11 ). CCL11, CCL17, and CCL22 have all been shown to play a role in the recruitment of Th2 cells and eosinophils that express their cognate receptors (CCR4 for CCL17 and CCL22, CCR3 for CCL11) ( 30 - 33 ). Matthews et al ( 23 ) demonstrated that depletion of CCL11 in vacvG-immunized mice reduces the total numbers of eosinophils in the lung after RSV challenge. Importantly, the reduction of eosinophils in CCL11-depleted mice is only ?2-fold as compared to mock-treated mice, suggesting that other Th2-associated chemokines may compensate and facilitate the trafficking of eosinophils into the lung. This data is similar to allergic models of airway disease where CCL11-deficient mice display only partially decreased numbers of eosinophils in the lung, again suggesting roles for other Th2-associated chemokines (i.e. CCL17, CCL22) in the onset of eosinophilic disease ( 34 , 35 ). Interestingly, whereas the absence of CCL11 in asthma models only partially reduces airway eosinophilia, depletion of either CCL17 or CCL22 completely abrogates pulmonary eosinophilia induced by repeated allergen stimulation ( 34 - 37 ). Further studies concluded that depletion of CCL22 dramatically reduced the trafficking of Th2 cells into the lung of allergen challenged mice ( 32 ). These data are consistent with our previous findings that vacvG-immunized mice undergoing a concurrent M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response have similar numbers of RSV-specific Th1 cells at day 5 post-RSV challenge, but have significantly decreased total numbers of RSV-specific Th2 cells at the same time point ( 7 ). Taken together, these data suggest that the modulation of CCL17 and CCL22 chemokine levels by RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells may alter the trafficking of both Th2 cells and eosinophils into the lungs after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice. It is currently unclear how memory CD8 T cells inhibit the production of CCL17 and CCL22 in the lungs early after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice. It is unlikely that accelerating viral clearance is responsible for this early decrease in chemokine production as the kinetics of viral clearance is similar in vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice ( Figure 3 ). Hussell et al ( 20 ) demonstrated that vacvF-immunized mice develop pulmonary eosinophilia after antibody-mediated depletion of either CD8 T cells or IFN-?, suggesting that IFN-? may be required for CD8 T cell inhibition of RSV vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia. This concept is attractive because of the known inhibitory effects of IFN-? on Th2 cells ( 38 - 40 ). Furthermore, IFN-? has been previously demonstrated to inhibit the production of CCL17 and/or CCL22 ( 41 - 43 ). However, we have previously shown that RSV M282-specific memory CD8 T cells inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice in the absence of IFN-? ( 7 ). We have also demonstrated here that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of IFN-?-deficient mice that have been previously immunized with vacvF ( Figure 12 ). One potential alternative is that M282-specific CD8 T cells may eliminate CCL17/CCL22-producing cells via a perforin- or FasL-dependent mechanism, however this has not been directly tested. RSV vaccine-enhanced disease is a prime example of CD4 T cell-mediated immunopathology. Our results suggest that immunization that induces both RSV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses provides maximal resistance to viral infection as well as protection from the development of Th2 cell-driven pulmonary eosinophilia. Data presented here strongly suggests that memory CD8 T cells modulate disease-causing Th2 responses by altering Th2-associated chemokines, specifically CCL17 and CCL22, and thus the trafficking of Th2 cells, and possibly eosinophils, into the lung. CCL17 and CCL22 are also induced after RSV infection of lung epithelial cells suggesting that these CCR4 ligands may potentially play a role in disease after acute RSV infection ( 25 , 44 ). Our results highlight the critical role chemokines play in shaping the inflammatory response that enters the lung following RSV infection and how modulation of this inflammation can alter the development of immunopathology.  Discussion CD8 T cells play a prominent role in the clearance of intracellular pathogens. In addition, CD8 T cells also have been shown to inhibit pathological CD4 T cell responses ( 7 , 14 , 27 , 28 ). Previous work has established that RSV-specific CD8 T cells can inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia during RSV challenge of previously immunized mice ( 14 , 20 ). We have recently demonstrated that induction of an RSV M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response inhibits both the total number of Th2 cells and eosinophils in the lung after RSV challenge of mice previously immunized with either vacvG- or FI-RSV ( 7 ). Because the presence of Th2 cells in the lung is required to induce pulmonary eosinophilia in this model ( 29 ), these results suggest that RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells inhibit the trafficking and/or expansion of Th2 cells. In this report, we show that the ability of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells to inhibit RSV vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia is critically dependent on the total number of virus-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung early after infection. Simply decreasing the number of M282-specific CD8 T cells present in the lungs early after RSV challenge (day 3) results in the development of pulmonary eosinophilia ( Figure 7 ). Moreover, we demonstrate that memory CD8 T cells specific to the subdominant F85?93 epitope, if present in high enough numbers early after RSV challenge, also inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia in vacvG plus vacvF-immunized mice ( Figure 9 ). However, the underlying mechanisms of how these early memory CD8 T cell responses prevent the Th2-driven eosinophilic response remain unclear. Chemokines are critical for trafficking of immune cells to sites of inflammation. Murine eosinophils and CD4 T cells have been shown to express different chemokine receptors based on their localization or functional phenotype ( 30 ). Our data indicates that the presence of a high number of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells in the lung early after RSV challenge alters the chemokine environment in the lung ( Figures 8 and 11 ). Interestingly, we observed a preferential decrease in the protein levels of CCL17 and CCL22 and no change in the levels of CCL11 ( Figures 8 and 11 ). CCL11, CCL17, and CCL22 have all been shown to play a role in the recruitment of Th2 cells and eosinophils that express their cognate receptors (CCR4 for CCL17 and CCL22, CCR3 for CCL11) ( 30 - 33 ).

This data is similar to allergic models of airway disease where CCL11-deficient mice display only partially decreased numbers of eosinophils in the lung, again suggesting roles for other Th2-associated chemokines (i.e. CCL17, CCL22) in the onset of eosinophilic disease ( 34 , 35 ). Interestingly, whereas the absence of CCL11 in asthma models only partially reduces airway eosinophilia, depletion of either CCL17 or CCL22 completely abrogates pulmonary eosinophilia induced by repeated allergen stimulation ( 34 - 37 ). Further studies concluded that depletion of CCL22 dramatically reduced the trafficking of Th2 cells into the lung of allergen challenged mice ( 32 ). These data are consistent with our previous findings that vacvG-immunized mice undergoing a concurrent M282-specific memory CD8 T cell response have similar numbers of RSV-specific Th1 cells at day 5 post-RSV challenge, but have significantly decreased total numbers of RSV-specific Th2 cells at the same time point ( 7 ). Taken together, these data suggest that the modulation of CCL17 and CCL22 chemokine levels by RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells may alter the trafficking of both Th2 cells and eosinophils into the lungs after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice. It is currently unclear how memory CD8 T cells inhibit the production of CCL17 and CCL22 in the lungs early after RSV challenge of vacvG-immunized mice. It is unlikely that accelerating viral clearance is responsible for this early decrease in chemokine production as the kinetics of viral clearance is similar in vacvG plus vacvF- and vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice ( Figure 3 ). Hussell et al ( 20 ) demonstrated that vacvF-immunized mice develop pulmonary eosinophilia after antibody-mediated depletion of either CD8 T cells or IFN-?, suggesting that IFN-? may be required for CD8 T cell inhibition of RSV vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia. This concept is attractive because of the known inhibitory effects of IFN-? on Th2 cells ( 38 - 40 ). Furthermore, IFN-? has been previously demonstrated to inhibit the production of CCL17 and/or CCL22 ( 41 - 43 ). However, we have previously shown that RSV M282-specific memory CD8 T cells inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of vacvG plus vacvM2-immunized mice in the absence of IFN-? ( 7 ). We have also demonstrated here that M282-specific memory CD8 T cells inhibit the development of pulmonary eosinophilia after RSV challenge of IFN-?-deficient mice that have been previously immunized with vacvF ( Figure 12 ). One potential alternative is that M282-specific CD8 T cells may eliminate CCL17/CCL22-producing cells via a perforin- or FasL-dependent mechanism, however this has not been directly tested. RSV vaccine-enhanced disease is a prime example of CD4 T cell-mediated immunopathology. Our results suggest that immunization that induces both RSV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses provides maximal resistance to viral infection as well as protection from the development of Th2 cell-driven pulmonary eosinophilia. Data presented here strongly suggests that memory CD8 T cells modulate disease-causing Th2 responses by altering Th2-associated chemokines, specifically CCL17 and CCL22, and thus the trafficking of Th2 cells, and possibly eosinophils, into the lung. CCL17 and CCL22 are also induced after RSV infection of lung epithelial cells suggesting that these CCR4 ligands may potentially play a role in disease after acute RSV infection ( 25 , 44 ). Our results highlight the critical role chemokines play in shaping the inflammatory response that enters the lung following RSV infection and how modulation of this inflammation can alter the development of immunopathology.
