Mechanisms of microbial traversal of the blood–brain barrier Central nervous system (CNS) infections continue to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Microbial invasion and traversal of the blood–brain barrier is a prerequisite for CNS infections. Pathogens can cross the blood–brain barrier transcellularly, paracellularly and/or in infected phagocytes (the so-called Trojan-horse mechanism). Consequently, pathogens can cause blood–brain barrier dysfunction, including increased permeability, pleocytosis and encephalopathy. A more complete understanding of the microbial–host interactions that are involved in microbial traversal of the blood–brain barrier and the associated barrier dysfunction should help to develop new strategies to prevent CNS infections.  Conclusions A major limitation to advances in the prevention and treatment of CNS infection is our incomplete understanding of these diseases and the associated blood–brain barrier dysfunction. Studies of the in vitro model of the blood–brain barrier and the in vivo animal model of experimental haematogenous meningitis have shed some light on the mechanisms of microbial traversal of the blood–brain barrier, the key step for the development of CNS infections. This traversal is the result of specific microorganism–host interactions and involves host cell signal-transduction pathways that affect host cell actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. It is unclear, however, whether the mechanisms that are involved in the traversal of the blood–brain barrier are similar and/or different in the various pathogens that cause CNS infection, such as bacteria, fungi and parasites ( BOXes 1 , 2 ; TABLE 1 ). A more complete knowledge of microbial interactions with the blood–brain barrier might facilitate the development of novel strategies for the prevention and therapy of CNS infections.
