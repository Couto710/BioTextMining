‘Clickable’ Polymer-Caged Nanobins as a Modular Drug Delivery Platform Modularly clickable polymer-caged nanobins (PCNs) were prepared from liposome templates using a drop-in cholesterol-modified poly(acrylic acid) reagent followed by crosslinking with alkyne-functionalized diamine linker that can allow for the conjugation of azido-modified targeting ligands via click ligation. These PCNs possess pH-responsive characteristics that can be used to trigger the release of encapsulated doxorubicin (DXR) payload inside the liposomal core under mild acidic conditions. After click-conjugation with azide-modified folate as an active targeting ligand, the resulting folate-conjugated, DXR-loaded PCNs (f-PCNDXR) demonstrated enhanced potency to folate receptor (FR)-positive tumor cells such as KB and OvCa432 over FR-negative MCF7 cells. f-PCNDXR can readily discriminate FR-positive tumor cells as a function of the level of cellular FR-expression, showing different degrees of potentiation in each cell. With both targeting functionalities and pH-sensitive drug-releasing triggers, f-PCNDXR exhibited 50 times enhanced potency to cancer cells that overexpress the folate target receptors.

Measurements Fourier-transformed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed on a Varian INOVA-500 MHz spectrometer in the Northwestern Integrated Molecular Structure Education and Research Center (IMSERC) facilities. Chemical shifts of 1H NMR spectra are reported in ppm against residual solvent resonance as the internal standard (CHCl3 = 7.27 ppm, CHD2COCD3 = 2.05 ppm, CHD2OD = 3.31 ppm). Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad FTS-60 FTIR.

HPLC-grade THF was used as an eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and the instrument was calibrated using polystyrene standards (Aldrich, 15 standards, 760-1,800,000 Daltons). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on an Agilent 1100 instrument equipped with a Jupiter 4u Proteo 90-Å semiprep reverse phase column (250 mm × 10.0 mm) at a flow rate of 2 mL/min, using gradient eluent derived from two different solvent mixtures: A (0.1% TFA in water) and B (0.1% TFA in acetonitrile). Method 1 (for purification of azido-PEG-folate and analyses of click reaction products): at 0 min, solvent mixture A/B = 95/5 v/v; at 25 min, solvent mixture A/B = 50/50 v/v; at 35 min, solvent mixture A/B = 10/90 v/v; at 40 min, solvent mixture A/B = 0/100 v/v. Method 2 (for purification of alkyne-modified diamine crosslinker): at 0 min, solvent mixture A/B = 95/5 v/v; at 30 min, solvent mixture A/B = 5/90 v/v; at 40 min, solvent mixture A/B = 0/100 v/v. Zeta potential and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed on a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Marvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) with a He-Ne laser (633 nm). Non-invasive backscatter method (detection at 173o scattering angle) was used. Correlation data were fitted, using the method of cumulants, to the logarithm of the correlation function, yielding the diffusion coefficient, D . The hydrodynamic diameters ( D H) of the BLs and PCNs were calculated using D and the Stokes-Einstein equation ( D H = k BT/3??D , where k B is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and ? is the solvent viscosity ( ? = 0.8872 cP for water)). The polydispersity index (PDI) of liposomes— represented as 2c/b 2 , where b and c are first and second order coefficients, respectively, in a polynomial of a semi-log correlation function—was calculated by the cumulants analysis. Size distribution of vesicles was obtained by the non-negative least squares (NNLS) analysis. 69 Unless noted otherwise, all samples were dispersed in 10-mM HEPES solution (pH 7.4, 150-mM NaCl) for DLS measurements.

Synthesis of Alkyne-Modified Diamine Crosslinker (2-(2-(2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy)-acetamido)-<italic>N</italic>-(2-(2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl)pent-4-ynamide) (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Scheme 2</xref>) The alkyne-modified cross-linker was synthesized using a solid-phase methodology on O -bis(aminoethyl)ethylene glycol trityl resin using a fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-based double-coupling strategy ( Scheme 2 ) on a CS-Bio CS136 peptide synthesizer (Menlo Park, CA). N ?-Fmoc-(L)-2-propargylglycine was first coupled to the resin mediated by HBTU in DMF. After deprotection of the Fmoc carbamate group (by the addition of 20% v/v piperidine (PIP) in DMF), subsequent coupling of {2-[2-(Fmoc-amino)ethoxy]ethoxy}acetic acid with HBTU was carried out. The synthesized crosslinker was detached from the resin using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC using method 2 (see measurements). The final Fmoc group was not removed so that it can serve as a UV-vis tag in further analyses (see below). IR(CH2Cl2): 2934, 1682, 1539, 1203, 1136, 837, 800, 721 cm-1. ESIMS: m/z = 389.92 observed for M2+, 388.23 calculated. Preparation of Alkyne-modified, Doxorubicin-loaded Polymer-Caged Nanobins Doxorubicin-loaded bare liposome was prepared using a modified literature procedure. 37 To a cylindrical glass vial (15 mm × 45 mm) was added DPPC (18.048 ?mol), DOPG (1.152 ?mol), and cholesterol (12.8 ?mol, 40 mol% of the total membrane components; this number is chosen to eliminate the thermal instability of the liposomes that is attributable to the intrinsic phase-transition temperature of the lipid 70 , 71 ), followed by chloroform (0.5 mL) to make a colorless solution. After vortexing (30 sec), the solvent was removed by passing a stream of nitrogen over the solution while the vial was warmed in a 50 °C water bath. The resulting dry film was further dried under vacuum on a Schlenk line (< 30 mTorr) for one hour. Next, the dry lipid films were hydrated in 250 mM aqueous ammonium sulfate solution (500 ?L) followed by vigorous vortexing (3-5 min on a Vortex Mixer, American Scientific Products) to form a dispersion of multilamellar vesicles. After this dispersion was subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles, it was extruded ten times through two stacked polycarbonate extrusion membranes (80-nm pore-size) that are maintained at 50 °C in a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). The excess ammonium sulfate outside liposome was removed by Sephadex G-50 (10 mL) gel-filtration chromatography pre-equilibrated with 150-mM NaCl solution. To the collected liposome solution (? 600-800 ?L of a solution with 4-mM lipid concentration) was added doxorubicin (DXR, 0.35 equiv of the total lipid content) followed by incubation at 50 °C for 24 h. The excess DXR outside of the liposome was then removed by Dowex 50WX4 cation-exchange resin. The loading of the DXR was determined by breaking up the DXR-loaded liposome in a 75-mM HCl solution in 90% 2-propanol and measuring the dissolved doxorubicin concentration using UV-vis spectroscopy based on the extinction coefficient ( ? ) of DXR (11207 M-1cm-1 at ?max = 480 nm). Mean hydrodynamic diameter ( D H) of 108 ± 17 nm was determined by DLS measurements ( Figure S1 in the SI ). The DXR-loaded bare liposomes (BLDXR) is next subjected to the PCN fabrication process as reported previously. 8 For this process, 10 mol% of the Chol-PAA modifier was chosen to maximize the amount of the modifier while preventing local phase-segregation of all the cholesterol in the membrane. Additionally, 50% of acrylate repeating units in Chol-PAA chains were crosslinked with alkyne-modified diamine crosslinker (25 mol%; if >35 mol% of the crosslinker is used, precipitation will occur, presumably due to interparticle crosslinkings). Mean D H of 124 ± 21 nm was determined by DLS measurements ( Figure S1 in the SI ). The resulting alkyne-modified, DXR-loaded PCN (PCNDXR) can then be used directly in the conjugation with azido-PEG-folate (see below). DXR-Release Assay under Various pH Conditions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) Solutions of BLDXR, PCNDXR, and f-PCNDXR (1 mM of lipids in 20 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.0, 150 mM NaCl), 20 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl), and 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl)) were incubated in a 1-mL Quarz SUPRASIL fluorescence cell (Hellma Cells Inc., Plainview, NY) at either 37 °C or 25 °C with magnetic stirring. The fluorescence from the liposome-encapsulated DXR was self-quenched due to its high concentration inside the liposome. 39 Hence, only the fluorescence from the DXR that has released out of the liposome was measured as a function of incubation time. Afterward, 5% aqueous Triton X-100 (reduced form, 5.0 ?L) was added to totally break up the liposomes and the final DXR fluorescence was measured to give the 100% release value. The extent of release was observed by comparing to the maximum release value determined by addition of 5% aqueous Triton X-100 (reduced form, 5.0 ?L). 8 Conjugation of Azido-ethidium to Alkyne-modified PCN by Click Chemistry (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5 in ESI</xref>) Due to the duplication of fluorescence spectra between ethidium and DXR, empty PCNs were used in this experiment. To a solution containing the alkyne-modified PCNs (1.0 mL of a 10.642 mM solution), ethidium bromide monoazide (2 mg, 4.758 ?mol), CuSO4·5H2O (2 mM), and a freshly prepared sodium ascorbate solution (2.0 mg, 10 ?mol) was added. The reaction mixture was wrapped with aluminum foil and stirred at room temperature for 5 h in dark. The resulting folate-conjugated PCNDXR solution was purified by Sephadex G-50 gel-filtration chromatography that has been pre-equilibrated with HEPES buffer (20 mM; [NaCl] = 150 mM, pH 7.4) (10 mL total volume for the equilibrated stationary phase). The fluorescent spectrum of the isolated product was then obtained to determine the extent of conjugation. As a control experiment, the same conjugation described above was carried out without Cu catalyst. Synthesis of the Azido-PEG-folate Targeting Ligand Azido-PEG-folate was synthesized by reacting O -(2-aminoethyl)- O ?-(2-azidoethyl)octaethylene glycol (456.1 umol, Aldrich) with folic acid (547.3 umol, Aldrich) in a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution (5 mL) containing dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 547.3 umol) and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP, 45.6 umol). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight in the dark at room temperature during which time dicyclohexylurea formed as a precipitate. After the urea byproduct was removed by filtration, the product was precipitated from the reaction mixture by addition of an excess amount of cold diethyl ether. The precipitated crude product was purified by silica gel flash chromatography, eluting with a stepwise gradient of methanol (20 to 80% v/v) in chloroform that has been modified with triethylamine (0.1% v/v). The solid product was further purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC using method 1. In HPLC analysis, two different ?- and ?-modified folate isomers were observed (in the ratio of 46% and 54%) and both were used as targeting ligands without further separation due to the well-known targeting ability of both isomers to FR-positive cells. 27 , 46 IR(KBr): 3295, 2114, 1697, 1609, 1514, 1304, 1109 cm-1 . ESIMS: m/z = 862.46 observed; 862.40 calculated. The concentration of folic acid in azido-PEG-folate was determined by quantitative UV-vis spectroscopy in water based on the extinction coefficient ( ? ) of folic acid (27022 M-1 cm-1 at ?max = 278 nm). Conditions for the Click Reaction between Azido-PEG-folate and Alkyne-Modified Diamine Crosslinker (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Scheme 3</xref>) In the search for the conditions to carry out the ‘click’ reaction between the azido-PEG-folate reagent and the alkyne-modified diamine crosslinker, the Fmoc-protected diamine crosslinker was used without removal of protecting group so that it can serve as a UV-vis tag in HPLC analysis ( ? = 14246 M-1cm-1 at ?max = 263 nm). To a solution containing the alkyne-modified diamine crosslinker (1.146 ?mol), azido-PEG-folate (1.146 ?mol), and CuSO4·5H2O (2 mM) in 20-mM HEPES buffer (500 ?L, pH 7.4, [NaCl] = 150 mM) was added a freshly prepared sodium ascorbate solution (0.5 mL of a 300-mM solution; final concentration of ascorbate is 50 mM in water). The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 h before being filtered through a syringe filter. The collected filtrate was analyzed by HPLC (method 1, Figure 2a ), MALDI-TOF MS ( Figure 2b ), and FTIR ( Figure S3 in the SI ), which show complete formation of the desired product. Conjugation of Azido-PEG-folate to Alkyne-modified PCN<sub>DXR</sub> by Click Chemistry (Preparation of f-PCN<sub>DXR</sub>) To a solution containing the alkyne-modified PCNDXR (570 ?L of a 2.169-mM solution), azido-PEG-folate (24.72 nmol, ? 1 mol% of the total lipid content), CuSO4·5H2O (2 mM), and a freshly prepared sodium ascorbate solution (1.2 mg in 300 ?L of water, 6.18 ?mol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The resulting folate-conjugated PCNDXR solution was purified by Sephadex G-50 (10 mL) gel-filtration chromatography that has been pre-equilibrated with HEPES buffer (20 mM; [NaCl] = 150 mM, pH 7.4). To determine the final concentration of DXR in the as-prepared f-PCNDXR, a small amount of this solution was first broken up in 20-mM HEPES buffer solution (pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) including reduced Triton X-100 (? 5 ?L of a 5 vol% aqueous solution). The dissolved doxorubicin concentration was then measured using UV-vis spectroscopy based on the extinction coefficient ( ? ) of free DXR at known isosbestic point 72 (3530.6 M-1cm-1 at ? = 543 nm). To determine the yield of the click reaction, the same conjugation described above was carried out with alkyne-modified empty PCNs (vide supra). This was necessary to avoid the overlapping UV-vis absorbances between DXR and folate in f-PCNDXR. The yield of the conjugation with folate was determined by quantitative UV-vis spectroscopy based on the extinction coefficient (?) of folic acid (27022 M-1cm-1 at ?max = 278 nm, Figure S4 ). Cell Culture a. Medium Folate-free Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 cell culture medium (containing (L)-glutamine and phenol red) and trypsin solution (0.25%, containing EDTA) was purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Penicillin-Streptomycin, (L)-glutamine, Fungizone, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 1× without calcium and magnesium, Catalog # 21-040) solutions were purchased from Mediatech (Manassas, VA). Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). b. Cell Lines Human epithelial nasopharyngeal carcinoma (KB) cells and epithelial ovarian carcinoma (OvCa432) cells were continuously cultured in folate-free RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.5% (v/v) Penicillin-Streptomycin solution at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Human mammary carcinoma (MCF7) cells were continuously cultured in EMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) Penicillin-Streptomycin solution, 1% (v/v) (L)-glutamine solution, and 1% (v/v) Fungizone solution at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) Study (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) KB and OvCa432 cells were planted in 12-well plate containing a sterilized glass coverslip (2 mL/well, 25 kcell/mL) for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before each experiment. Each cell was incubated with the appropriate drug formulation in folate-free medium (500 ?L, [DXR] = 20 ?M) for 2 or 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After the removal of drug-containing medium, the cell layers were washed with cold PBS (4 × 2 mL) and fixed with PBS-buffered 4% formaldehyde for 5 min, then washed with PBS (3 × 2 mL). Next, the coverslips were placed on slides (Superfrost plus, 25 × 75 × 1 mm, VWR) coated with PBS (50 ?L). CLSM images were observed with inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 510 META) with excitation at 488 nm. At this wavelength, no observable background fluorescence was detected from the cell lines ( Figure S6 in ESI ). A water immersion objective, C-Apochromat 40x/1.20 W korr. UV-Vis-IR M27 was used. Obtained images were converted to TIFF format by using ZEN 2007 Light Edition SP1 software (Carl Zeiss). Cytotoxicity Assays (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) The cells were seeded in 48-well plates (200 ?L/well) with a concentration of 100,000 cells/mL in folate-free RPMI-1640 medium and were incubated to grow for 24 h. The media in the wells were replaced with the pre-prepared growth media containing the appropriate drug formulation (200 ?L of solution at the appropriate doxorubicin concentrations). For exposure regime 1, the drug-treated cells were then further incubated for 2 h in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C, after which the drug-containing media were removed by aspiration. The remaining cell layers were washed with PBS buffer (2 × 250 ?L) followed by replacement with fresh growth media (200 ?L). The plates were then maintained in the incubator at 37 °C for a further 46 h. For exposure regime 2, the drug-treated cells were incubated for continuous 48 h in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C, after which the cells were washed with PBS buffer (2 × 250 ?L). The viable and nonviable cells from cultures were differentially stained with Guava Viacount reagent (Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA) which contains two fluorescence dyes (a cell membrane-permeable dye and an impermeable dye except for the cells that have lost membrane integrity), allowing assessment of the viable, dead, and midapoptotic cells. 58 Then the absolute number of viable cells was counted by Guava ViaCount Assay 59 and the relative cell survival percentages compared to the drug-free control were plotted against the total DXR concentration in logarithmic scale. The data reported represent an average of five measurements from different batches. The dose-response curves were obtained by sigmoidal logistic fitting using Origin 6.1 73 and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined on the basis of the fitted data. Relative Determination of Folate Receptor Levels in Cell Lines via Quantification of f-PCN<sub>DXR</sub> Uptake (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) KB, OvCa432, and MCF7 cells were plated in two 12-well plates for 24 h before experiment (2 mL/well, 250 kcells/mL, plate 1 for quantification of DXR and plate 2 for cell counting). Cells were exposed to f-PCNDXR ([DXR] = 10 ?M) for 2 h and washed with cold PBS buffer (3 × 2 mL). After trypsinized, each cell line was washed with cold PBS (2 mL/well) and pelleted by centrifugation (1500 rpm, 4 °C, 5 min). After removing the supernatant, cells were re-suspended in cold (4 °C) PBS solution (2 mL) followed by centrifugation. After washing by suspension/centrifugation process three times, cells from plate 1 were solubilized by adding an aqueous solution of Triton-X 100 (?10 ?L or more of a 5 vol% solution until the cells are completely dissolved) and diluted to 200 ?L total volume with EDTA-modified HEPES buffer (20 mM; [NaCl] = 150 mM, [EDTA] = 1 mM, pH 7.4). The cell-associated DXR fluorescence was measured (?ex = 478 nm, ?em = 580 nm, slit = 14 nm) and the amount of DXR was calculated using a pre-determined calibration curve. The numbers of DXR molecules per cell were determined against the total number of cells obtained with Guava ViaCount Assay 59 using the samples from plate 2.

The final Fmoc group was not removed so that it can serve as a UV-vis tag in further analyses (see below). IR(CH2Cl2): 2934, 1682, 1539, 1203, 1136, 837, 800, 721 cm-1. ESIMS: m/z = 389.92 observed for M2+, 388.23 calculated.  Preparation of Alkyne-modified, Doxorubicin-loaded Polymer-Caged Nanobins Doxorubicin-loaded bare liposome was prepared using a modified literature procedure. 37 To a cylindrical glass vial (15 mm × 45 mm) was added DPPC (18.048 ?mol), DOPG (1.152 ?mol), and cholesterol (12.8 ?mol, 40 mol% of the total membrane components; this number is chosen to eliminate the thermal instability of the liposomes that is attributable to the intrinsic phase-transition temperature of the lipid 70 , 71 ), followed by chloroform (0.5 mL) to make a colorless solution. After vortexing (30 sec), the solvent was removed by passing a stream of nitrogen over the solution while the vial was warmed in a 50 °C water bath. The resulting dry film was further dried under vacuum on a Schlenk line (< 30 mTorr) for one hour. Next, the dry lipid films were hydrated in 250 mM aqueous ammonium sulfate solution (500 ?L) followed by vigorous vortexing (3-5 min on a Vortex Mixer, American Scientific Products) to form a dispersion of multilamellar vesicles. After this dispersion was subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles, it was extruded ten times through two stacked polycarbonate extrusion membranes (80-nm pore-size) that are maintained at 50 °C in a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). The excess ammonium sulfate outside liposome was removed by Sephadex G-50 (10 mL) gel-filtration chromatography pre-equilibrated with 150-mM NaCl solution. To the collected liposome solution (? 600-800 ?L of a solution with 4-mM lipid concentration) was added doxorubicin (DXR, 0.35 equiv of the total lipid content) followed by incubation at 50 °C for 24 h. The excess DXR outside of the liposome was then removed by Dowex 50WX4 cation-exchange resin. The loading of the DXR was determined by breaking up the DXR-loaded liposome in a 75-mM HCl solution in 90% 2-propanol and measuring the dissolved doxorubicin concentration using UV-vis spectroscopy based on the extinction coefficient ( ? ) of DXR (11207 M-1cm-1 at ?max = 480 nm). Mean hydrodynamic diameter ( D H) of 108 ± 17 nm was determined by DLS measurements ( Figure S1 in the SI ). The DXR-loaded bare liposomes (BLDXR) is next subjected to the PCN fabrication process as reported previously. 8 For this process, 10 mol% of the Chol-PAA modifier was chosen to maximize the amount of the modifier while preventing local phase-segregation of all the cholesterol in the membrane. Additionally, 50% of acrylate repeating units in Chol-PAA chains were crosslinked with alkyne-modified diamine crosslinker (25 mol%; if >35 mol% of the crosslinker is used, precipitation will occur, presumably due to interparticle crosslinkings). Mean D H of 124 ± 21 nm was determined by DLS measurements ( Figure S1 in the SI ). The resulting alkyne-modified, DXR-loaded PCN (PCNDXR) can then be used directly in the conjugation with azido-PEG-folate (see below).  DXR-Release Assay under Various pH Conditions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) Solutions of BLDXR, PCNDXR, and f-PCNDXR (1 mM of lipids in 20 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.0, 150 mM NaCl), 20 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl), and 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl)) were incubated in a 1-mL Quarz SUPRASIL fluorescence cell (Hellma Cells Inc., Plainview, NY) at either 37 °C or 25 °C with magnetic stirring. The fluorescence from the liposome-encapsulated DXR was self-quenched due to its high concentration inside the liposome. 39 Hence, only the fluorescence from the DXR that has released out of the liposome was measured as a function of incubation time. Afterward, 5% aqueous Triton X-100 (reduced form, 5.0 ?L) was added to totally break up the liposomes and the final DXR fluorescence was measured to give the 100% release value. The extent of release was observed by comparing to the maximum release value determined by addition of 5% aqueous Triton X-100 (reduced form, 5.0 ?L). 8  Conjugation of Azido-ethidium to Alkyne-modified PCN by Click Chemistry (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5 in ESI</xref>) Due to the duplication of fluorescence spectra between ethidium and DXR, empty PCNs were used in this experiment. To a solution containing the alkyne-modified PCNs (1.0 mL of a 10.642 mM solution), ethidium bromide monoazide (2 mg, 4.758 ?mol), CuSO4·5H2O (2 mM), and a freshly prepared sodium ascorbate solution (2.0 mg, 10 ?mol) was added. The reaction mixture was wrapped with aluminum foil and stirred at room temperature for 5 h in dark. The resulting folate-conjugated PCNDXR solution was purified by Sephadex G-50 gel-filtration chromatography that has been pre-equilibrated with HEPES buffer (20 mM; [NaCl] = 150 mM, pH 7.4) (10 mL total volume for the equilibrated stationary phase). The fluorescent spectrum of the isolated product was then obtained to determine the extent of conjugation. As a control experiment, the same conjugation described above was carried out without Cu catalyst.  Synthesis of the Azido-PEG-folate Targeting Ligand Azido-PEG-folate was synthesized by reacting O -(2-aminoethyl)- O ?-(2-azidoethyl)octaethylene glycol (456.1 umol, Aldrich) with folic acid (547.3 umol, Aldrich) in a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution (5 mL) containing dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 547.3 umol) and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP, 45.6 umol). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight in the dark at room temperature during which time dicyclohexylurea formed as a precipitate. After the urea byproduct was removed by filtration, the product was precipitated from the reaction mixture by addition of an excess amount of cold diethyl ether. The precipitated crude product was purified by silica gel flash chromatography, eluting with a stepwise gradient of methanol (20 to 80% v/v) in chloroform that has been modified with triethylamine (0.1% v/v). The solid product was further purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC using method 1. In HPLC analysis, two different ?- and ?-modified folate isomers were observed (in the ratio of 46% and 54%) and both were used as targeting ligands without further separation due to the well-known targeting ability of both isomers to FR-positive cells. 27 , 46 IR(KBr): 3295, 2114, 1697, 1609, 1514, 1304, 1109 cm-1 . ESIMS: m/z = 862.46 observed; 862.40 calculated. The concentration of folic acid in azido-PEG-folate was determined by quantitative UV-vis spectroscopy in water based on the extinction coefficient ( ? ) of folic acid (27022 M-1 cm-1 at ?max = 278 nm).  Conditions for the Click Reaction between Azido-PEG-folate and Alkyne-Modified Diamine Crosslinker (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Scheme 3</xref>) In the search for the conditions to carry out the ‘click’ reaction between the azido-PEG-folate reagent and the alkyne-modified diamine crosslinker, the Fmoc-protected diamine crosslinker was used without removal of protecting group so that it can serve as a UV-vis tag in HPLC analysis ( ? = 14246 M-1cm-1 at ?max = 263 nm). To a solution containing the alkyne-modified diamine crosslinker (1.146 ?mol), azido-PEG-folate (1.146 ?mol), and CuSO4·5H2O (2 mM) in 20-mM HEPES buffer (500 ?L, pH 7.4, [NaCl] = 150 mM) was added a freshly prepared sodium ascorbate solution (0.5 mL of a 300-mM solution; final concentration of ascorbate is 50 mM in water). The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 h before being filtered through a syringe filter. The collected filtrate was analyzed by HPLC (method 1, Figure 2a ), MALDI-TOF MS ( Figure 2b ), and FTIR ( Figure S3 in the SI ), which show complete formation of the desired product.  Conjugation of Azido-PEG-folate to Alkyne-modified PCN<sub>DXR</sub> by Click Chemistry (Preparation of f-PCN<sub>DXR</sub>) To a solution containing the alkyne-modified PCNDXR (570 ?L of a 2.169-mM solution), azido-PEG-folate (24.72 nmol, ? 1 mol% of the total lipid content), CuSO4·5H2O (2 mM), and a freshly prepared sodium ascorbate solution (1.2 mg in 300 ?L of water, 6.18 ?mol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The resulting folate-conjugated PCNDXR solution was purified by Sephadex G-50 (10 mL) gel-filtration chromatography that has been pre-equilibrated with HEPES buffer (20 mM; [NaCl] = 150 mM, pH 7.4). To determine the final concentration of DXR in the as-prepared f-PCNDXR, a small amount of this solution was first broken up in 20-mM HEPES buffer solution (pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) including reduced Triton X-100 (? 5 ?L of a 5 vol% aqueous solution). The dissolved doxorubicin concentration was then measured using UV-vis spectroscopy based on the extinction coefficient ( ? ) of free DXR at known isosbestic point 72 (3530.6 M-1cm-1 at ? = 543 nm). To determine the yield of the click reaction, the same conjugation described above was carried out with alkyne-modified empty PCNs (vide supra). This was necessary to avoid the overlapping UV-vis absorbances between DXR and folate in f-PCNDXR. The yield of the conjugation with folate was determined by quantitative UV-vis spectroscopy based on the extinction coefficient (?) of folic acid (27022 M-1cm-1 at ?max = 278 nm, Figure S4 ).

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) Study (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) KB and OvCa432 cells were planted in 12-well plate containing a sterilized glass coverslip (2 mL/well, 25 kcell/mL) for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before each experiment. Each cell was incubated with the appropriate drug formulation in folate-free medium (500 ?L, [DXR] = 20 ?M) for 2 or 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After the removal of drug-containing medium, the cell layers were washed with cold PBS (4 × 2 mL) and fixed with PBS-buffered 4% formaldehyde for 5 min, then washed with PBS (3 × 2 mL). Next, the coverslips were placed on slides (Superfrost plus, 25 × 75 × 1 mm, VWR) coated with PBS (50 ?L). CLSM images were observed with inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 510 META) with excitation at 488 nm. At this wavelength, no observable background fluorescence was detected from the cell lines ( Figure S6 in ESI ). A water immersion objective, C-Apochromat 40x/1.20 W korr. UV-Vis-IR M27 was used. Obtained images were converted to TIFF format by using ZEN 2007 Light Edition SP1 software (Carl Zeiss).  Cytotoxicity Assays (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) The cells were seeded in 48-well plates (200 ?L/well) with a concentration of 100,000 cells/mL in folate-free RPMI-1640 medium and were incubated to grow for 24 h. The media in the wells were replaced with the pre-prepared growth media containing the appropriate drug formulation (200 ?L of solution at the appropriate doxorubicin concentrations). For exposure regime 1, the drug-treated cells were then further incubated for 2 h in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C, after which the drug-containing media were removed by aspiration. The remaining cell layers were washed with PBS buffer (2 × 250 ?L) followed by replacement with fresh growth media (200 ?L). The plates were then maintained in the incubator at 37 °C for a further 46 h. For exposure regime 2, the drug-treated cells were incubated for continuous 48 h in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C, after which the cells were washed with PBS buffer (2 × 250 ?L). The viable and nonviable cells from cultures were differentially stained with Guava Viacount reagent (Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA) which contains two fluorescence dyes (a cell membrane-permeable dye and an impermeable dye except for the cells that have lost membrane integrity), allowing assessment of the viable, dead, and midapoptotic cells. 58 Then the absolute number of viable cells was counted by Guava ViaCount Assay 59 and the relative cell survival percentages compared to the drug-free control were plotted against the total DXR concentration in logarithmic scale. The data reported represent an average of five measurements from different batches. The dose-response curves were obtained by sigmoidal logistic fitting using Origin 6.1 73 and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined on the basis of the fitted data.  Relative Determination of Folate Receptor Levels in Cell Lines via Quantification of f-PCN<sub>DXR</sub> Uptake (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) KB, OvCa432, and MCF7 cells were plated in two 12-well plates for 24 h before experiment (2 mL/well, 250 kcells/mL, plate 1 for quantification of DXR and plate 2 for cell counting). Cells were exposed to f-PCNDXR ([DXR] = 10 ?M) for 2 h and washed with cold PBS buffer (3 × 2 mL). After trypsinized, each cell line was washed with cold PBS (2 mL/well) and pelleted by centrifugation (1500 rpm, 4 °C, 5 min). After removing the supernatant, cells were re-suspended in cold (4 °C) PBS solution (2 mL) followed by centrifugation. After washing by suspension/centrifugation process three times, cells from plate 1 were solubilized by adding an aqueous solution of Triton-X 100 (?10 ?L or more of a 5 vol% solution until the cells are completely dissolved) and diluted to 200 ?L total volume with EDTA-modified HEPES buffer (20 mM; [NaCl] = 150 mM, [EDTA] = 1 mM, pH 7.4). The cell-associated DXR fluorescence was measured (?ex = 478 nm, ?em = 580 nm, slit = 14 nm) and the amount of DXR was calculated using a pre-determined calibration curve. The numbers of DXR molecules per cell were determined against the total number of cells obtained with Guava ViaCount Assay 59 using the samples from plate 2.  Supplementary Material 1_si_001  Results and Discussion DXR was first loaded into bare liposomes using an ammonium sulfate gradient. The resulting DXR-loaded bare liposomes (BLDXR, DXR/lipid = 0.3 mol/mol) was then modified with 10 mol% (compared to the total amount of phospholipids in liposome) of Chol-PAA ( M? n: 3,700 Da, PDI: 1.2), previously synthesized via nitroxide-mediated controlled radical polymerization. The grafted polymers on the liposomal surface were subsequently crosslinked with a newly designed alkyne-modified diamine linker ( Scheme 2 ) to yield DXR-loaded polymer-caged nanobin (PCNDXR; zeta potential ? = -15.04 ± 0.96 mV at pH 7.4, 25 °C; hydrodynamic diameter D H = 124 ± 21 nm as measured by dynamic light scattering, Figure S1 in Electronic Supporting Information (ESI) ). After PCNDXR formation, the majority of encapsulated DXR was still present inside the intact liposome (DXR/lipid = 0.28-0.30 mol/mol). The drug-releasing kinetics for PCNDXR was monitored under acidic conditions ( Figure 1a ). Because the emission intensity from PCNDXR was substantially self-quenched when DXR is highly loaded inside the liposome, 39 the amount of drug released is conveniently monitored using fluorescent spectroscopy against the total release obtained by the treatment of the liposomes with Triton X-100 ( Figure 1b ). 3 , 8 As expected, PCNDXR was quite stable at pH 7.4, with 30% release of DXR after 3 days at 37 °C. At pH 5.0 and 37 °C, however, ?75% of DXR was released from PCNDXR during the initial 24 h and complete release was achieved at 36 h (>90% release). In contrast, 55% release was achieved from BLDXR at pH 5.0 and 37 °C after 3 days ( Figure S2 in ESI , see also Table S1 in ESI for a list of apparent DXR-release rates from PCNDXR at different pH conditions). The enhanced releasing property of the PCN platform under acidic condition, comparing to that of BL, has been ascribed to the structural change of encapsulating polymer cage, resulting in the formation of transient pores on liposomal membrane. 8 , 40 Although we have previously observed acid-triggered release of the anionic probe calcein from PCN, 8 the release rate of DXR from PCNs, as reported herein, is significantly faster and may be additionally attributed to both the intrinsic lipophilicity of DXR and the cationic character of protonated DXR inside liposome. 37 While similar preference for cation permeation has been observed for a lipid membrane modified with acrylate-based polymers, 41 the non-crosslinked precursor of PCN does not have the significant acid-triggered releasing property. 8 In this sense, the crosslinked PAA cages in the PCN system can play a very important role in triggering the release of DXR under acidic condition. We note that acid-triggered release of physically entrapped doxorubicin has been observed in shell-crosslinked knedel-like naoparticles 42 and PEGylated nanogels, 43 albeit with different physical mechanisms. Folic acid was next conjugated to alkyne-functionalized PCNDXR via an azide-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacer ( Scheme 1 ). The PEG spacer was included to enhance aqueous solubility; its inclusion has also been shown to enhance the targeting activity of surface-attached folate. 44 - 46 The required azido-PEG-folate reagent was synthesized in one step from FA and a commercially available azido-PEG amine via DCC-mediated amide coupling. To establish the conditions for the click reaction, equimolar amounts of azido-PEG-folate reagent and alkyne-functionalized diamine crosslinker were reacted together in the presence of CuSO4 and sodium ascorbate ( Scheme 3 ), with the triazole product verified by reverse-phase HPLC analyses ( Figure 2a ), MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry ( Figure 2b ), and FT-IR spectroscopy ( Figure S3 in ESI ). The parent alkyne-functionalized PCNDXR were then treated with 1 mol% (compared to total lipids in PCNs) of the azido-PEG-folate reagent under similar conditions. (The level of folate-conjugation on PCNs was kept below 1 mol% compared to the amount of lipids, because ?0.5 mol% of folate per liposome was reported as an optimized value for targeting. 47 ) After click reaction and purification, the resulting folate-conjugated PCNs (f-PCNs) contains about 0.73 mol% of folate ligand as determined by UV-vis spectroscopy ( Figure S4 in ESI ). The modular versatility of the alkyne groups on the surface of PCNs was also demonstrated with click-conjugation of an azido-ethidium dye to empty PCNs ( Figure S5 in ESI ). To verify that f-PCNDXR can be uptaken into cells via FR-mediated endocytosis, FR-overexpressing KB human epithelial nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells (?2.8 × 10 5 FRs per cell) 47 were exposed to f-PCNDXR, either alone or in the presence of 2-mM free folate ligand for 2 h and 4 h. Confocal laser-scanning fluorescent microscopy images were obtained for all incubated cells based on the fluorescence of DXR (?em > 570 nm, no observable background fluorescence was detected from the cell lines at this wavelength, Figure S6 in ESI ). More DXR fluorescence was detected from the KB cells exposed to f-PCNDXR alone ( Figure 3a ) than from those incubated with free folate ( Figure 3b ), suggesting the internalization of f-PCNDXR was drastically hindered by free folate ligand. After 4 h of incubation, increased accumulation of DXR in the cells that were incubated with f-PCNDXR alone was very apparent: they have more intense cytosolic fluorescence ( Figure 3c ), 48 suggesting that more f-PCNDXR have been internalized via FR-mediated endocytosis, In contrast, cytosolic fluorescence from the cells that were incubated with both f-PCNDXR and free ligand remains low, indicating that FR-mediated endocytosis of f-PCNDXR was mostly blocked by free folates ( Figure 3d ). The cellular internalization efficiencies of f-PCNDXR, PCNDXR, and BLDXR were evaluated by incubating them with KB cells and OvCa432 epithelial ovarian carcinoma cells that are known to have expressed FR but at a level that is lower than that of KB cells. 49 , 50 Incubations with free DXR were also carried out as controls. After 4 h, CLSM images were obtained for all incubated cells based on DXR fluorescence ( Figure 4 ). Among the images shown in Figure 4 , the cultured cells that have been exposed to free DXR are the brightest ( Figures 4d and 4h ), consistent with free DXR being able to enter the cells rapidly by free diffusion. 51 For both KB and OvCa432 cells, the intracellular fluorescence from PCNDXR ( Figures 4b and 4f ) was significantly higher than those from BLDXR ( Figures 4a and 4e ). While both types of liposome might be internalized by non-specific adsorptive endocytosis 52 into the endosomes which have acidic environment (pH = 5 - 6), 53 the pH-sensitive polymer cages in PCNDXR can more efficiently transfer DXR into the cytoplasm by destabilizing both liposomal and endosomal membrane. 30 , 54 , 55 For KB cells incubated with f-PCNDXR ( Figure 4c ), brighter fluorescence intensities than those incubated with PCNDXR ( Figure 4b ) were observed, due to the enhanced cellular uptake via FR-mediated endocytosis. While similar cellular fluorescence images with dark nuclear regions were also observed in OvCa432 cells that has been incubated with f-PCNDXR ( Figure 4g ), the fluorescence intensity was lower than that observed for the KB cells, consistent with the lower level of FR expression in OvCa432. Analogous low associations of folate-targeted carriers have been reported for HeLa cells that have lower level of FR expression compared to KB cells. 56 , 57 The cytotoxicities of the PCN formulations were evaluated in FR-positive KB and OvCa432 cells, and in FR-deficient MCF7 human mammary carcinoma cells. 49 , 56 Each cell line was exposed to the drug preparations (free DXR, BLDXR, PCNDXR, or f-PCNDXR) in folate-free growth media under two different exposure regimes: 1) a 2-h pulsed exposure to drugs followed by a 46-h post-incubation in drug-free media, or 2) a continuous 48-h incubation in drug-containing media. The absolute numbers of both viable and dead cells were counted using Guava ViaCount assays 58 , 59 and the relative dose-responsive cell survival percentages compared to the drug-free control were plotted against the total DXR concentration ( Figures 5a-5f ). Half-maximum inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values as determined from the dose-response curves, Table 1 ) and degrees of potentiation 60 (DOP = [IC50(free drug)/IC50(drug in carrier)] × 100, Figure 5g ) clearly show the relative potency of BLDXR, PCNDXR, and f-PCNDXR compared to free DXR. For KB cells, f-PCNDXR (DOP = 144%) is about 50-fold more potent (potency = DOP of drug formulation 1/DOP of drug formulation 2) 61 than non-targeted PCNDXR (DOP = 3.1%) in exposure regime 1. In the presence of free folate ligands (1 mM), the cytotoxicity of f-PCNDXR, as indicated by the IC50 value, was reduced about four-folds but not completely blocked, suggesting an enhanced binding affinity 62 resulting from the multivalent binding nature of f-PCNDXR. In exposure regime 2 (continuous 48-h incubation with the drug formulations), the difference in cytotoxicities toward KB cells between f-PCNDXR and PCNDXR was reduced, due to the sufficient internalization of non-targeted PCNDXR (through non-specific adsorptive endocytosis) 52 , 63 over this long period ( Figure 5b ). Consistent with a mechanism where targeting can enhance drug efficacy, FR-negative MCF7 cells show no measurable difference in cell viability responses toward f-PCNDXR and PCNDXR for both incubation regimes ( Figures 5e and 5f ). However, both formulations still showed better efficacy than BLDXR, possibly due to the acid-triggered drug-releasing property of PCNs. For OvCa432 cells, where the level of FR-expression is low, a slight enhancement in targeting efficiency was observed for f-PCNDXR over non-targeted PCNDXR in exposure regime 1 ( Figure 5c ). Presumably, the low level of expressed FRs on OvCa432 was not sufficient to allow for large enhancements in cellular uptake of DXR from f-PCNDXR within a short exposure time. While the exact mechanism is still under debate, 64 such uptake has been shown to depend on the density of receptor on cell surface. 45 , 47 In addition, the net cellar accumulation of drugs via FR-mediated endocytosis depends on the time required for the internalized FRs recycling back to cell surface after unloading the ligands inside endosomal compartments, which is ranging from 8 to 12 h. 24 , 65 Given these criteria, an appropriately longer incubation should allow for enhanced uptake and lead to improved therapeutic efficacy of f-PCNDXR over non-targeted PCNDXR ( Figure 5d ) for OvCa432. We note that similar low targeting efficiency has been reported for a low FR-expressing cell line during short exposure to a folate-toxin conjugate. 66 In addition, a 10 5 receptors/cell level has been suggested as a threshold below which targeted therapy become ineffective. 67 The bar graphs of Figure 5h provide several comparisons of the DOP values for each of the three cell lines in this study. Because the intrinsic toxicity of DXR is different for every cell line, DOP is a more appropriate indicator of the targeting effectiveness of f-PCNDXR than IC50 value. However, this parameter depends greatly on the exposure time. In the short-exposure regime 1, the DOP clearly reflects the level of FR-expression in each cell line, suggesting that f-PCNDXR can discriminate the cell lines depending on the level of FR-expression by multivalent interactions. 68 In contrast, little selectivity was observed in the long-exposure regime 2 where non-specific absorption became the main contributor to the cellular uptake of PCNDXR. The above data suggests that the optimized therapeutic window for any drug formulations must be derived separately for each cell type depending on the level of target receptor expression. The exposure time of a specific cancer cell to multivalent receptor-targeted therapeutics such as f-PCNDXR should be long enough to maximize effective receptor-mediated endocytosis but not so long as to have the uptake advantages being nullified by non-specific processes. In this sense, our click-based drop-in strategy for the preparation of f-PCNDXR provides a facile and modular strategy for tuning the density and morphology of targeting ligands to match the spectrum of biological receptor expression on the cell surface and arrive at the optimum therapeutic window. Conclusions In conclusion, we have demonstrated a facile, modular strategy for the production of a targeted drug delivery system based on polymer-caged nanobins. Our data shows that these nanobins can effectively deliver a significant bolus of therapeutic agent to cancer cells. Once inside the cell, these nanobins undergo triggered-release of the drug in cellular acidic microenviroments such as endosome. The incorporation of a terminal alkyne handle into the polymer cage enables a modular, drop-in strategy for PCN functionalization and allows for the conjugation of virtually any azide-modifiable targeting group onto PCNs without the loss of structural integrity or multivalent targeting capability. Coupled to the pronounced pH-sensitive release trigger of the polymer cage, the ‘clickable’ PCN platform can facilitate the synthesis of a broad range of targeted therapeutics. As a proof of concept shown herein, folate-conjugated PCNs can be engineered to deliver drug payload to specific receptor-positive tumor cells with high selectivity. The ability to engender stability, multivalent targeting capability, release trigger, and other functionalities into nanoscale drug delivery vehicles in a facile and modular fashion should make PCN a highly versatile platform that can significantly enhance the utility of liposomal delivery technology in tumors.

Tert -butyl acrylate was stirred over CaH2 under nitrogen and fractionated by vacuum transfer right before use. Cholesterol-terminated poly(acrylic acid) was prepared using a literature procedure. 8 Ultrapure deionized water was obtained from a Millipore system (18.2 M? cm resistivity). Measurements Fourier-transformed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed on a Varian INOVA-500 MHz spectrometer in the Northwestern Integrated Molecular Structure Education and Research Center (IMSERC) facilities. Chemical shifts of 1H NMR spectra are reported in ppm against residual solvent resonance as the internal standard (CHCl3 = 7.27 ppm, CHD2COCD3 = 2.05 ppm, CHD2OD = 3.31 ppm). Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad FTS-60 FTIR. FTIR spectra of small-molecule compounds were measured by dropping a CH2Cl2 solution of the compound on a NaCl plate and allowing the solvent to evaporate prior to measurements. KBr-pellets were prepared for FTIR measurements of azido-PEG-folate, alkyne-modified diamine crosslinker, and click products. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained on a Jobin Yvon Fluorolog fluorometer (?ex = 475 nm, ?em = 596 nm, slith width = 3 nm for doxorubicin; ?ex = 475 nm, ?em = 610 nm, slith width = 5 nm for ethidium bromide monoazide). UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained on a CARY 300 Bio UV-vis spectrophotometer. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) studies were peformed on a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 META microscope. Electrospray-ionization mass spectrometric (ESIMS) data were obtained on a Micromass Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Phosphorus concentration was determined using a Varian Vista MPX simultaneous inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed on a PE Voyager DE-Pro MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer in positive ionization mode, using 3-indoleacrylic acid as a matrix. Polymer molecular weights were measured relative to polystyrene standards on a Waters gel-permeation chromatograph (GPC) equipped with Breeze software, a 717 autosampler, Shodex KF-G guard column, KF-803L and KF-806L columns in series, a Waters 2440 UV detector, and a 410 RI detector. HPLC-grade THF was used as an eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and the instrument was calibrated using polystyrene standards (Aldrich, 15 standards, 760-1,800,000 Daltons). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on an Agilent 1100 instrument equipped with a Jupiter 4u Proteo 90-Å semiprep reverse phase column (250 mm × 10.0 mm) at a flow rate of 2 mL/min, using gradient eluent derived from two different solvent mixtures: A (0.1% TFA in water) and B (0.1% TFA in acetonitrile). Method 1 (for purification of azido-PEG-folate and analyses of click reaction products): at 0 min, solvent mixture A/B = 95/5 v/v; at 25 min, solvent mixture A/B = 50/50 v/v; at 35 min, solvent mixture A/B = 10/90 v/v; at 40 min, solvent mixture A/B = 0/100 v/v. Method 2 (for purification of alkyne-modified diamine crosslinker): at 0 min, solvent mixture A/B = 95/5 v/v; at 30 min, solvent mixture A/B = 5/90 v/v; at 40 min, solvent mixture A/B = 0/100 v/v. Zeta potential and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed on a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Marvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) with a He-Ne laser (633 nm). Non-invasive backscatter method (detection at 173o scattering angle) was used. Correlation data were fitted, using the method of cumulants, to the logarithm of the correlation function, yielding the diffusion coefficient, D . The hydrodynamic diameters ( D H) of the BLs and PCNs were calculated using D and the Stokes-Einstein equation ( D H = k BT/3??D , where k B is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and ? is the solvent viscosity ( ? = 0.8872 cP for water)). The polydispersity index (PDI) of liposomes— represented as 2c/b 2 , where b and c are first and second order coefficients, respectively, in a polynomial of a semi-log correlation function—was calculated by the cumulants analysis. Size distribution of vesicles was obtained by the non-negative least squares (NNLS) analysis. 69 Unless noted otherwise, all samples were dispersed in 10-mM HEPES solution (pH 7.4, 150-mM NaCl) for DLS measurements. The data reported represent an average of ten measurements with five scans each. Synthesis of Alkyne-Modified Diamine Crosslinker (2-(2-(2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy)-acetamido)-<italic>N</italic>-(2-(2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl)pent-4-ynamide) (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Scheme 2</xref>) The alkyne-modified cross-linker was synthesized using a solid-phase methodology on O -bis(aminoethyl)ethylene glycol trityl resin using a fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-based double-coupling strategy ( Scheme 2 ) on a CS-Bio CS136 peptide synthesizer (Menlo Park, CA). N ?-Fmoc-(L)-2-propargylglycine was first coupled to the resin mediated by HBTU in DMF. After deprotection of the Fmoc carbamate group (by the addition of 20% v/v piperidine (PIP) in DMF), subsequent coupling of {2-[2-(Fmoc-amino)ethoxy]ethoxy}acetic acid with HBTU was carried out. The synthesized crosslinker was detached from the resin using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC using method 2 (see measurements). The final Fmoc group was not removed so that it can serve as a UV-vis tag in further analyses (see below). IR(CH2Cl2): 2934, 1682, 1539, 1203, 1136, 837, 800, 721 cm-1. ESIMS: m/z = 389.92 observed for M2+, 388.23 calculated. Preparation of Alkyne-modified, Doxorubicin-loaded Polymer-Caged Nanobins Doxorubicin-loaded bare liposome was prepared using a modified literature procedure. 37 To a cylindrical glass vial (15 mm × 45 mm) was added DPPC (18.048 ?mol), DOPG (1.152 ?mol), and cholesterol (12.8 ?mol, 40 mol% of the total membrane components; this number is chosen to eliminate the thermal instability of the liposomes that is attributable to the intrinsic phase-transition temperature of the lipid 70 , 71 ), followed by chloroform (0.5 mL) to make a colorless solution. After vortexing (30 sec), the solvent was removed by passing a stream of nitrogen over the solution while the vial was warmed in a 50 °C water bath. The resulting dry film was further dried under vacuum on a Schlenk line (< 30 mTorr) for one hour. Next, the dry lipid films were hydrated in 250 mM aqueous ammonium sulfate solution (500 ?L) followed by vigorous vortexing (3-5 min on a Vortex Mixer, American Scientific Products) to form a dispersion of multilamellar vesicles. After this dispersion was subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles, it was extruded ten times through two stacked polycarbonate extrusion membranes (80-nm pore-size) that are maintained at 50 °C in a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). The excess ammonium sulfate outside liposome was removed by Sephadex G-50 (10 mL) gel-filtration chromatography pre-equilibrated with 150-mM NaCl solution. To the collected liposome solution (? 600-800 ?L of a solution with 4-mM lipid concentration) was added doxorubicin (DXR, 0.35 equiv of the total lipid content) followed by incubation at 50 °C for 24 h. The excess DXR outside of the liposome was then removed by Dowex 50WX4 cation-exchange resin. The loading of the DXR was determined by breaking up the DXR-loaded liposome in a 75-mM HCl solution in 90% 2-propanol and measuring the dissolved doxorubicin concentration using UV-vis spectroscopy based on the extinction coefficient ( ? ) of DXR (11207 M-1cm-1 at ?max = 480 nm). Mean hydrodynamic diameter ( D H) of 108 ± 17 nm was determined by DLS measurements ( Figure S1 in the SI ). The DXR-loaded bare liposomes (BLDXR) is next subjected to the PCN fabrication process as reported previously. 8 For this process, 10 mol% of the Chol-PAA modifier was chosen to maximize the amount of the modifier while preventing local phase-segregation of all the cholesterol in the membrane. Additionally, 50% of acrylate repeating units in Chol-PAA chains were crosslinked with alkyne-modified diamine crosslinker (25 mol%; if >35 mol% of the crosslinker is used, precipitation will occur, presumably due to interparticle crosslinkings). Mean D H of 124 ± 21 nm was determined by DLS measurements ( Figure S1 in the SI ). The resulting alkyne-modified, DXR-loaded PCN (PCNDXR) can then be used directly in the conjugation with azido-PEG-folate (see below). DXR-Release Assay under Various pH Conditions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) Solutions of BLDXR, PCNDXR, and f-PCNDXR (1 mM of lipids in 20 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.0, 150 mM NaCl), 20 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl), and 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl)) were incubated in a 1-mL Quarz SUPRASIL fluorescence cell (Hellma Cells Inc., Plainview, NY) at either 37 °C or 25 °C with magnetic stirring. The fluorescence from the liposome-encapsulated DXR was self-quenched due to its high concentration inside the liposome. 39 Hence, only the fluorescence from the DXR that has released out of the liposome was measured as a function of incubation time. Afterward, 5% aqueous Triton X-100 (reduced form, 5.0 ?L) was added to totally break up the liposomes and the final DXR fluorescence was measured to give the 100% release value. The extent of release was observed by comparing to the maximum release value determined by addition of 5% aqueous Triton X-100 (reduced form, 5.0 ?L). 8 Conjugation of Azido-ethidium to Alkyne-modified PCN by Click Chemistry (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5 in ESI</xref>) Due to the duplication of fluorescence spectra between ethidium and DXR, empty PCNs were used in this experiment. To a solution containing the alkyne-modified PCNs (1.0 mL of a 10.642 mM solution), ethidium bromide monoazide (2 mg, 4.758 ?mol), CuSO4·5H2O (2 mM), and a freshly prepared sodium ascorbate solution (2.0 mg, 10 ?mol) was added. The reaction mixture was wrapped with aluminum foil and stirred at room temperature for 5 h in dark. The resulting folate-conjugated PCNDXR solution was purified by Sephadex G-50 gel-filtration chromatography that has been pre-equilibrated with HEPES buffer (20 mM; [NaCl] = 150 mM, pH 7.4) (10 mL total volume for the equilibrated stationary phase). The fluorescent spectrum of the isolated product was then obtained to determine the extent of conjugation. As a control experiment, the same conjugation described above was carried out without Cu catalyst. Synthesis of the Azido-PEG-folate Targeting Ligand Azido-PEG-folate was synthesized by reacting O -(2-aminoethyl)- O ?-(2-azidoethyl)octaethylene glycol (456.1 umol, Aldrich) with folic acid (547.3 umol, Aldrich) in a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution (5 mL) containing dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 547.3 umol) and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP, 45.6 umol). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight in the dark at room temperature during which time dicyclohexylurea formed as a precipitate. After the urea byproduct was removed by filtration, the product was precipitated from the reaction mixture by addition of an excess amount of cold diethyl ether. The precipitated crude product was purified by silica gel flash chromatography, eluting with a stepwise gradient of methanol (20 to 80% v/v) in chloroform that has been modified with triethylamine (0.1% v/v). The solid product was further purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC using method 1. In HPLC analysis, two different ?- and ?-modified folate isomers were observed (in the ratio of 46% and 54%) and both were used as targeting ligands without further separation due to the well-known targeting ability of both isomers to FR-positive cells. 27 , 46 IR(KBr): 3295, 2114, 1697, 1609, 1514, 1304, 1109 cm-1 . ESIMS: m/z = 862.46 observed; 862.40 calculated. The concentration of folic acid in azido-PEG-folate was determined by quantitative UV-vis spectroscopy in water based on the extinction coefficient ( ? ) of folic acid (27022 M-1 cm-1 at ?max = 278 nm). Conditions for the Click Reaction between Azido-PEG-folate and Alkyne-Modified Diamine Crosslinker (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Scheme 3</xref>) In the search for the conditions to carry out the ‘click’ reaction between the azido-PEG-folate reagent and the alkyne-modified diamine crosslinker, the Fmoc-protected diamine crosslinker was used without removal of protecting group so that it can serve as a UV-vis tag in HPLC analysis ( ? = 14246 M-1cm-1 at ?max = 263 nm). To a solution containing the alkyne-modified diamine crosslinker (1.146 ?mol), azido-PEG-folate (1.146 ?mol), and CuSO4·5H2O (2 mM) in 20-mM HEPES buffer (500 ?L, pH 7.4, [NaCl] = 150 mM) was added a freshly prepared sodium ascorbate solution (0.5 mL of a 300-mM solution; final concentration of ascorbate is 50 mM in water). The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 h before being filtered through a syringe filter. The collected filtrate was analyzed by HPLC (method 1, Figure 2a ), MALDI-TOF MS ( Figure 2b ), and FTIR ( Figure S3 in the SI ), which show complete formation of the desired product. Conjugation of Azido-PEG-folate to Alkyne-modified PCN<sub>DXR</sub> by Click Chemistry (Preparation of f-PCN<sub>DXR</sub>) To a solution containing the alkyne-modified PCNDXR (570 ?L of a 2.169-mM solution), azido-PEG-folate (24.72 nmol, ? 1 mol% of the total lipid content), CuSO4·5H2O (2 mM), and a freshly prepared sodium ascorbate solution (1.2 mg in 300 ?L of water, 6.18 ?mol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The resulting folate-conjugated PCNDXR solution was purified by Sephadex G-50 (10 mL) gel-filtration chromatography that has been pre-equilibrated with HEPES buffer (20 mM; [NaCl] = 150 mM, pH 7.4). To determine the final concentration of DXR in the as-prepared f-PCNDXR, a small amount of this solution was first broken up in 20-mM HEPES buffer solution (pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) including reduced Triton X-100 (? 5 ?L of a 5 vol% aqueous solution). The dissolved doxorubicin concentration was then measured using UV-vis spectroscopy based on the extinction coefficient ( ? ) of free DXR at known isosbestic point 72 (3530.6 M-1cm-1 at ? = 543 nm). To determine the yield of the click reaction, the same conjugation described above was carried out with alkyne-modified empty PCNs (vide supra). This was necessary to avoid the overlapping UV-vis absorbances between DXR and folate in f-PCNDXR. The yield of the conjugation with folate was determined by quantitative UV-vis spectroscopy based on the extinction coefficient (?) of folic acid (27022 M-1cm-1 at ?max = 278 nm, Figure S4 ). Cell Culture a. Medium Folate-free Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 cell culture medium (containing (L)-glutamine and phenol red) and trypsin solution (0.25%, containing EDTA) was purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Penicillin-Streptomycin, (L)-glutamine, Fungizone, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 1× without calcium and magnesium, Catalog # 21-040) solutions were purchased from Mediatech (Manassas, VA). Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). b. Cell Lines Human epithelial nasopharyngeal carcinoma (KB) cells and epithelial ovarian carcinoma (OvCa432) cells were continuously cultured in folate-free RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.5% (v/v) Penicillin-Streptomycin solution at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Human mammary carcinoma (MCF7) cells were continuously cultured in EMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) Penicillin-Streptomycin solution, 1% (v/v) (L)-glutamine solution, and 1% (v/v) Fungizone solution at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) Study (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) KB and OvCa432 cells were planted in 12-well plate containing a sterilized glass coverslip (2 mL/well, 25 kcell/mL) for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before each experiment. Each cell was incubated with the appropriate drug formulation in folate-free medium (500 ?L, [DXR] = 20 ?M) for 2 or 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After the removal of drug-containing medium, the cell layers were washed with cold PBS (4 × 2 mL) and fixed with PBS-buffered 4% formaldehyde for 5 min, then washed with PBS (3 × 2 mL). Next, the coverslips were placed on slides (Superfrost plus, 25 × 75 × 1 mm, VWR) coated with PBS (50 ?L). CLSM images were observed with inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 510 META) with excitation at 488 nm. At this wavelength, no observable background fluorescence was detected from the cell lines ( Figure S6 in ESI ). A water immersion objective, C-Apochromat 40x/1.20 W korr. UV-Vis-IR M27 was used. Obtained images were converted to TIFF format by using ZEN 2007 Light Edition SP1 software (Carl Zeiss). Cytotoxicity Assays (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) The cells were seeded in 48-well plates (200 ?L/well) with a concentration of 100,000 cells/mL in folate-free RPMI-1640 medium and were incubated to grow for 24 h. The media in the wells were replaced with the pre-prepared growth media containing the appropriate drug formulation (200 ?L of solution at the appropriate doxorubicin concentrations). For exposure regime 1, the drug-treated cells were then further incubated for 2 h in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C, after which the drug-containing media were removed by aspiration. The remaining cell layers were washed with PBS buffer (2 × 250 ?L) followed by replacement with fresh growth media (200 ?L). The plates were then maintained in the incubator at 37 °C for a further 46 h. For exposure regime 2, the drug-treated cells were incubated for continuous 48 h in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C, after which the cells were washed with PBS buffer (2 × 250 ?L). The viable and nonviable cells from cultures were differentially stained with Guava Viacount reagent (Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA) which contains two fluorescence dyes (a cell membrane-permeable dye and an impermeable dye except for the cells that have lost membrane integrity), allowing assessment of the viable, dead, and midapoptotic cells. 58 Then the absolute number of viable cells was counted by Guava ViaCount Assay 59 and the relative cell survival percentages compared to the drug-free control were plotted against the total DXR concentration in logarithmic scale. The data reported represent an average of five measurements from different batches. The dose-response curves were obtained by sigmoidal logistic fitting using Origin 6.1 73 and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined on the basis of the fitted data. Relative Determination of Folate Receptor Levels in Cell Lines via Quantification of f-PCN<sub>DXR</sub> Uptake (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) KB, OvCa432, and MCF7 cells were plated in two 12-well plates for 24 h before experiment (2 mL/well, 250 kcells/mL, plate 1 for quantification of DXR and plate 2 for cell counting). Cells were exposed to f-PCNDXR ([DXR] = 10 ?M) for 2 h and washed with cold PBS buffer (3 × 2 mL). After trypsinized, each cell line was washed with cold PBS (2 mL/well) and pelleted by centrifugation (1500 rpm, 4 °C, 5 min). After removing the supernatant, cells were re-suspended in cold (4 °C) PBS solution (2 mL) followed by centrifugation. After washing by suspension/centrifugation process three times, cells from plate 1 were solubilized by adding an aqueous solution of Triton-X 100 (?10 ?L or more of a 5 vol% solution until the cells are completely dissolved) and diluted to 200 ?L total volume with EDTA-modified HEPES buffer (20 mM; [NaCl] = 150 mM, [EDTA] = 1 mM, pH 7.4). The cell-associated DXR fluorescence was measured (?ex = 478 nm, ?em = 580 nm, slit = 14 nm) and the amount of DXR was calculated using a pre-determined calibration curve. The numbers of DXR molecules per cell were determined against the total number of cells obtained with Guava ViaCount Assay 59 using the samples from plate 2.  Conclusions In conclusion, we have demonstrated a facile, modular strategy for the production of a targeted drug delivery system based on polymer-caged nanobins. Our data shows that these nanobins can effectively deliver a significant bolus of therapeutic agent to cancer cells. Once inside the cell, these nanobins undergo triggered-release of the drug in cellular acidic microenviroments such as endosome. The incorporation of a terminal alkyne handle into the polymer cage enables a modular, drop-in strategy for PCN functionalization and allows for the conjugation of virtually any azide-modifiable targeting group onto PCNs without the loss of structural integrity or multivalent targeting capability. Coupled to the pronounced pH-sensitive release trigger of the polymer cage, the ‘clickable’ PCN platform can facilitate the synthesis of a broad range of targeted therapeutics. As a proof of concept shown herein, folate-conjugated PCNs can be engineered to deliver drug payload to specific receptor-positive tumor cells with high selectivity. The ability to engender stability, multivalent targeting capability, release trigger, and other functionalities into nanoscale drug delivery vehicles in a facile and modular fashion should make PCN a highly versatile platform that can significantly enhance the utility of liposomal delivery technology in tumors.
