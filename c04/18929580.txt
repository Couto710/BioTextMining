Acute kidney injury and lung dysfunction: a paradigm for remote organ effects of kidney disease?  Conclusion The extrarenal effects of AKI represent a clear example of local feedback loops “driving” systemic consequences. Upregulation of cytokine production, modulation of leukocyte function, and deranged NO metabolism have been rigorously examined as regards their effects on local organ function- e.g., renal function, recovery, or progression. However, we are increasingly aware that systemic dysregulation of such modulators arising due to AKI can have serious consequences for organ systems remote from the kidney. The data for such consequences of AKI are strongest for the lungs, but accumulating for other organ systems as well. Such effects likely contribute to the poor survival of patients suffering AKI despite excellent electrolyte, acid-base, volume, and small solute clearance. Recognition of the mediators and mechanisms by which AKI leads to lung changes is important for both improving dialytic management during AKI as well as development of novel therapeutics for this frequently fatal disease.
