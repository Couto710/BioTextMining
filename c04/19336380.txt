Lysosomal Storage Disorders in the Newborn Lysosomal storage disorders are rare inborn errors of metabolism, with a combined incidence of 1 in 1500 to 7000 live births. These relatively rare disorders are seldom considered when evaluating a sick newborn. A significant number of the >50 different lysosomal storage disorders, however, do manifest in the neonatal period and should be part of the differential diagnosis of several perinatal phenotypes. We review the earliest clinical features, diagnostic tests, and treatment options for lysosomal storage disorders that can present in the newborn. Although many of the lysosomal storage disorders are characterized by a range in phenotypes, the focus of this review is on the specific symptoms and clinical findings that present in the perinatal period, including neurologic, respiratory, endocrine, and cardiovascular manifestations, dysmorphic features, hepatosplenomegaly, skin or ocular involvement, and hydrops fetalis/congenital ascites. A greater awareness of these features may help to reduce misdiagnosis and promote the early detection of lysosomal storage disorders. Implementing therapy at the earliest stage possible is crucial for several of the lysosomal storage disorders; hence, an early appreciation of these disorders by physicians who treat newborns is essential.  CONCLUSIONS The LSDs are rare diseases that are caused by deficient lysosomal enzyme activity or by a deficient lysosomal protein that interferes with enzyme activity. The accumulation of substrates within the lysosomes of cells is believed to contribute to the disease manifestations. Clinically, these disorders can have multiorgan presentations, resulting from different patterns of substrate accumulation. Because most patients appear normal at birth, it is likely that these disorders are underdiagnosed and their incidence is underestimated. This review highlights the different neonatal presentations of LSDs in order to enhance physician awareness of these disorders in the newborn. LSDs need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of many diverse neonatal symptoms. A high index of suspicion is essential, because treatment, when available, is most likely to be effective when begun early in the course of the disease. Prompt diagnosis may enable both early treatment to prevent irreversible clinical sequelae and timely genetic counseling.
