Englerin A, a Selective Inhibitor of Renal Cancer Cell Growth, from Phyllanthus engleri An extract from Phyllanthus engleri was identified in a bioinformatic analysis of NCI 60-cell natural product extract screening data, that selectively inhibited the growth of renal cancer cell lines. Bioassay guided fractionation yielded two new guaiane sesquiterpenes, englerins A (1) and B (2). Englerin A showed 1000-fold selectivity against 6 of 8 renal cancer cell lines with GI50 values ranging from 1-87 nM. The structures of 1 and 2 and their relative stereochemistry were established by spectroscopic methods.
