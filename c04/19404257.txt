Autism genome-wide copy number variation reveals ubiquitin and neuronal genes Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are childhood neurodevelopmental disorders with complex genetic origins 1 – 4 . Previous studies focusing on candidate genes or genomic regions have identified several copy number variations (CNVs) that are associated with an increased risk of ASDs 5 – 9 . Here we present the results from a whole-genome CNV study on a cohort of 859 ASD cases and 1,409 healthy children of European ancestry who were genotyped with ~550,000 single nucleotide polymorphism markers, in an attempt to comprehensively identify CNVs conferring susceptibility to ASDs. Positive findings were evaluated in an independent cohort of 1,336 ASD cases and 1,110 controls of European ancestry. Besides previously reported ASD candidate genes, such as NRXN1 (ref. 10 ) and CNTN4 (refs 11 , 12 ), several new susceptibility genes encoding neuronal cell-adhesion molecules, including NLGN1 and ASTN2 , were enriched with CNVs in ASD cases compared to controls ( P = 9.5 × 10?3). Furthermore, CNVs within or surrounding genes involved in the ubiquitin pathways, including UBE3A , PARK2 , RFWD2 and FBXO40 , were affected by CNVs not observed in controls ( P = 3.3 × 10?3). We also identified duplications 55 kilobases upstream of complementary DNA AK123120 ( P = 3.6 × 10?6). Although these variants may be individually rare, they target genes involved in neuronal cell-adhesion or ubiquitin degradation, indicating that these two important gene networks expressed within the central nervous system may contribute to the genetic susceptibility of ASD.  METHODS SUMMARY All genome-wide SNP genotyping was performed using the InfiniumII HumanHap550 BeadChip at the Center for Applied Genomics at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). We called CNVs with the PennCNV algorithm 15 , which combines multiple values, including Log R Ratio, B Allele Frequency, SNP spacing and population frequency of the B allele into a hidden Markov model. The term ‘CNV’ represents individual CNV calls, whereas ‘CNVR’ refers to population-level variation. Quality control thresholds included a high success rate of attempted SNPs, low standard deviation of normalized intensity, genetically inferred European ancestry, low genomic wave artefacts, count of CNV calls per subject, and genotypic duplicate removal ( Supplementary Table 4 ). CNV frequency between cases and controls was evaluated at each SNP using Fisher’s exact test. We report statistical local minimums in reference to a region of nominal significance including SNPs residing within 1Mb of each other ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Resulting significant CNVRs were excluded if they were (1) residing on telomere or centromere proximal cytobands; (2) arising from a ‘peninsula’ of common CNV ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ); (3) genomic regions with extremes in GC content 27 ; or (4) samples contributing to multiple CNVRs. To adjust for siblings in the AGRE data, we calculated a permutation-based P value (×1,000), in which disease labels for siblings were permutated together. DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) 28 assessed the significance of functional annotation clustering. We considered loci significant between cases and controls ( P < 0.05) where ACC discovery cases had overlapping variation, replicated in AGRE or were not observed in control subjects, and validated with another method (qPCR Roche Universal Probe Library using qBase 29 , MRC-Holland MLPA, and Affymetrix 5.0 from Broad). Statistical correction of five deletion and nine duplication CNVRs, on the basis of discovery cohort (ACC) significance and signal review is appropriate for our study (‘CNV Filtering Steps’ in Supplementary Materials ).

The AGRE Affymetrix Replication track is on the basis of genome-wide 5.0 SNP genotyping data from the Broad Institute (see Supplementary Methods and Acknowledgements), and were generated using the PennCNV-Affy algorithm (see Supplementary Methods ), to serve as a further means to validate the Illumina-based CNV calls.
