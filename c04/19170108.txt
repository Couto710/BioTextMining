Mitochondrial localization, ELK-1 transcriptional regulation and Growth inhibitory functions of BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in families with breast and ovarian cancer. Several BRCA1 splice variants are found in different tissues, but their subcellular localization and functions are poorly understood at the moment. We previously described BRCA1 splice variant BRCA1a to induce apoptosis and function as a tumor suppressor of triple negative breast, ovarian and prostate cancers. In this study we have analyzed the function of BRCA1 isoforms (BRCA1a and BRCA1b) and compared them to the wild type BRCA1 protein using several criteria like studying expression in normal and tumor cells by RNase protection assays, sub cellular localization/fractionation by immunofluorescence microscopy and western blot analysis, transcription regulation of biological relevant proteins and growth suppression in breast cancer cells. We are demonstrating for the first time that ectopically expressed GFP-tagged BRCA1, BRCA1a, and BRCA1b proteins are localized to the mitochondria, repress ELK-1 transcriptional activity and possess antiproliferative activity on breast cancer cells. These results suggest that the exon 9,10 and 11 sequences (aa 263 – 1365) which contain two nuclear localization signals, p53, Rb, c-Myc, ?- tubulin, Stat, Rad 51, Rad 50 binding domains, angiopoietin-1 repression domain are not absolutely required for mitochondrial localization and growth suppressor function of these proteins. Since mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of cancer, we can speculate that the mitochondrial localization of BRCA1 proteins may be functionally significant in regulating both the mitochondrial DNA damage as well as apoptotic activity of BRCA1 proteins and mislocalization causes cancer.

Cells were stained for colonies approximately 21 days after transfections using crystal violet blue as described previously [ Chai, et al., 2001 ].  Analysis of Expression of BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b Transcripts by RNAase protection assay We studied the expression of BRCA1, BRCA1a, BRCA1b transcripts in different human normal and cancer cells using Ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) which is a very sensitive procedure for the detection and quantification of RNA. We observed expression of BRCA1 and BRCA1a/1b transcripts as represented by the predicted 220 bp (BRCA1) and 118 bp (BRCA1a and BRCA1b) protected fragment in normal mammary gland as well as in several cancer cells ( Figure 3 , HBL-100, CAL-51, NIH OVCAR3, COLO320, MOLT-4 and K562 cells). In some cancer cells like MCF-7 (lane 3), NIH OVCAR3 (lane 6), A431 (lane 9), MOLT4 (lane 11) and K562 (lane 12) the ratio of full length to the isoforms was altered when compared to normal mammary gland. It should be noted that RNAase protection assay does not distinguish between BRCA1a and BRCA1b transcripts.  Effect of BRCA1a and BRCA1b on GAL4-Elk1 Transcriptional Activation Elk-1 is an ETS-like gene that codes for a DNA binding protein that is involved in transcriptional activation, proliferation, differentiation, an activator of MAP kinases and induces apoptosis [ Shao, et al., 1998 ; Rao, et al., 1989 ; Hipskind, et al., 1991 ; Rao, 1994 ]. Elk-1 forms a ternary complex in conjunction with the serum response element (SRE) and serum response factor (SRF) to activate c-Fos [ Rao, 1994 ]. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown the splice variants BRCA1a and BRCA1b to associate with Elk-1 and to inhibit MAP kinase induced activity of c-Fos [ Chai, et al., 2001 ]. In order to determine any difference between wild type and mutant BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins on GAL4-Elk1 transcriptional activation, MCF7 breast cancer cells and HLR-ELK1 cells were transfected with various concentrations of BRCA1a and BRCA1b. HLR-ELK1 cells are a double-stable cell line that contains pFR-Luc and pFA2-Elk1 plasmids stably integrated within their genome. Phosphorylation of the transcriptional activation domain of Elk-1 by MAP kinase will activate transcription of a luciferase reporter plasmid in these cells. Luciferase activity levels serve as an indication of the activation or repression of signaling events. Similarly, MCF7 breast cancer cells were cotransfected with GAL4-Elk1 (305-428), MEK, E1bLuciferase reporter and pCMV ?– Gal and various concentrations of BRCA1a and BRCA1b. Both BRCA1a and BRCA1b were shown to decrease the relative luciferase activity as compared to the empty vector control ( Figure 4a ), indicating inhibition of Elk1 transcriptional activity. Because HLR-ELK1 cells already contain Elk1 and a luciferase reporter plasmid integrated in the genome, these cells were cotransfected with MEK, pCMV ?–Gal, BRCA1a and BRCA1b. Both BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins were shown to decrease the relative luciferase activity and therefore Elk-1 activity in HLR-ELK1 cells ( Figure 4b ). Several germ line mutations in the BRCA1 gene have been identified and are known to be associated with the early onset of breast and ovarian cancers. The change of a tyrosine to a stop codon at position 1853 of BRCA1 (Y1853 ter mutant) leads to a truncated protein eleven amino acids from the C-terminal end [ Monteiro, et al., 1996 ; Friedman, et al., 1994 ]. Because this mutation is located within the BRCA1 BRCT domain, which is involved in transcriptional activation and protein interactions, it is hypothesized that this mutation will disrupt the ability of BRCA1 to transcriptionally activate or repress Elk-1 [ Monteiro, et al., 1996 ]. MCF7 breast cancer cells and HLR-ELK1 cells were cotransfected with BRCA1a and BRCA1b Y1853 ter mutants. These mutants failed to repress the activation of Elk-1 ( Figures 4a and b ). These results suggest BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins to regulate the activity of ELK-1 protein.  Sub cellular Localization of BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins The sub cellular localization of BRCA1 and its splice variants have remained controversial. We have found wild type BRCA1 and BRCA1a to be localized in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm [ Wang, et al., 1997 ; Rao, et al., 1996 ]. Others have shown BRCA1 to be a nuclear protein that resides in secretory granules and also in the cytoplasm [ Chen, et al., 1995 ; Jensen, et al., 1996 ; Thakur, et al., 1997 ; Wang, et al., 1997 ]. Recent studies using immunoelectron microscopy results show endogenous BRCA1 protein to be localized in the mitochondria [ Coene, et al., 2005 ]. To study the localization of BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins within the cell, we have used GFP -tagged BRCA1 proteins. Immunofluorescence in MCF7 cells that have been transfected with EGFP-BRCA1/BRCA1a/BRCA1b using GFP antibodies showed the localization of BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins also in the mitochondria ( Figure5a ). The distribution of BRCA1/BRCA1a/BRCA1b differed between cell to cell as observed previously with BRCA1 using different antibodies ( Wang, et al,. 1997 ; Coene, et al., 2005 ; Rao, et al., 1996 .). COS1 cells were transfected with pCDNA3-BRCA1, EGFP-BRCA1a, EGFP-BRCA1b and nuclear, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial extracts were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using BRCA1 and GFP antibodies. Both endogenous as well as ectopically expressed BRCA1 proteins were found in the nucleus; cytoplasm as well as mitochondria using different BRCA1 antibodies ( Figure 5b ). Coene et al. used confocal and immunoelectron microscopy to illustrate the presence of endogenous BRCA1 in the mitochondria, similar to our results [ Coene, et al., 2005 ]. The EGFP-BRCA1a and EGFP-BRCA1b fusion protein at 137 and 127 kDa, respectively, were also found in mitochondrial, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions with anti-GFP and anti-BRCA1 antibodies via Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence ( Figure 5c ). Western blotting of the mitochondrial fractions with cytochrome C further supports the mitochondrial localization of these proteins ( Figure 5c ). We have found for the first time that epitope-tagged BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins to be located within mitochondria similar to endogenous BRCA1. Based on these observations we can speculate that the mitochondrial localization of BRCA1 proteins may be linked to their apoptotic function.  BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins suppress growth of human breast cancer cells BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins have been shown to inhibit the growth of breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer cells [ Chai, et al., 2007 ; Holt, et al., 1996 ; Aprelikova, et al., 1999 ]. In an attempt to compare the growth suppressive function of BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins MCF-7 breast cancer cells were transfected with either a BRCA1 or BRCA1a or BRCA1b or empty vector and selected with G418 and the colonies were counted after 21 days following staining with crystal violet. Over expression of BRCA1 and BRCA1a resulted in 50 – 60% and BRCA1b 50% reduction in the number of G418 – resistant colonies compared to vector alone ( Figure 6 ). These results suggest BRCA1a and BRCA1b to inhibit growth of breast cancer cells similar to BRCA1.  Results In vivo expression of BRCA1a and BRCA1b Proteins In order to determine if the BRCA1 splice variants could be expressed in vivo , COS-1 cells were transfected with BRCA1a or BRCA1b using FLAG and GFP vectors. Both BRCA1a (110 kDa) and BRCA1b (100 kDa) were expressed in COS1 cells using an anti-FLAG antibody ( Figure 2 ). Analysis of Expression of BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b Transcripts by RNAase protection assay We studied the expression of BRCA1, BRCA1a, BRCA1b transcripts in different human normal and cancer cells using Ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) which is a very sensitive procedure for the detection and quantification of RNA.

Immunofluorescence in MCF7 cells that have been transfected with EGFP-BRCA1/BRCA1a/BRCA1b using GFP antibodies showed the localization of BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins also in the mitochondria ( Figure5a ). The distribution of BRCA1/BRCA1a/BRCA1b differed between cell to cell as observed previously with BRCA1 using different antibodies ( Wang, et al,. 1997 ; Coene, et al., 2005 ; Rao, et al., 1996 .). COS1 cells were transfected with pCDNA3-BRCA1, EGFP-BRCA1a, EGFP-BRCA1b and nuclear, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial extracts were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using BRCA1 and GFP antibodies. Both endogenous as well as ectopically expressed BRCA1 proteins were found in the nucleus; cytoplasm as well as mitochondria using different BRCA1 antibodies ( Figure 5b ). Coene et al. used confocal and immunoelectron microscopy to illustrate the presence of endogenous BRCA1 in the mitochondria, similar to our results [ Coene, et al., 2005 ]. The EGFP-BRCA1a and EGFP-BRCA1b fusion protein at 137 and 127 kDa, respectively, were also found in mitochondrial, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions with anti-GFP and anti-BRCA1 antibodies via Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence ( Figure 5c ). Western blotting of the mitochondrial fractions with cytochrome C further supports the mitochondrial localization of these proteins ( Figure 5c ). We have found for the first time that epitope-tagged BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins to be located within mitochondria similar to endogenous BRCA1. Based on these observations we can speculate that the mitochondrial localization of BRCA1 proteins may be linked to their apoptotic function. BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins suppress growth of human breast cancer cells BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins have been shown to inhibit the growth of breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer cells [ Chai, et al., 2007 ; Holt, et al., 1996 ; Aprelikova, et al., 1999 ]. In an attempt to compare the growth suppressive function of BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins MCF-7 breast cancer cells were transfected with either a BRCA1 or BRCA1a or BRCA1b or empty vector and selected with G418 and the colonies were counted after 21 days following staining with crystal violet. Over expression of BRCA1 and BRCA1a resulted in 50 – 60% and BRCA1b 50% reduction in the number of G418 – resistant colonies compared to vector alone ( Figure 6 ). These results suggest BRCA1a and BRCA1b to inhibit growth of breast cancer cells similar to BRCA1.  Results In vivo expression of BRCA1a and BRCA1b Proteins In order to determine if the BRCA1 splice variants could be expressed in vivo , COS-1 cells were transfected with BRCA1a or BRCA1b using FLAG and GFP vectors. Both BRCA1a (110 kDa) and BRCA1b (100 kDa) were expressed in COS1 cells using an anti-FLAG antibody ( Figure 2 ). Analysis of Expression of BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b Transcripts by RNAase protection assay We studied the expression of BRCA1, BRCA1a, BRCA1b transcripts in different human normal and cancer cells using Ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) which is a very sensitive procedure for the detection and quantification of RNA. We observed expression of BRCA1 and BRCA1a/1b transcripts as represented by the predicted 220 bp (BRCA1) and 118 bp (BRCA1a and BRCA1b) protected fragment in normal mammary gland as well as in several cancer cells ( Figure 3 , HBL-100, CAL-51, NIH OVCAR3, COLO320, MOLT-4 and K562 cells). In some cancer cells like MCF-7 (lane 3), NIH OVCAR3 (lane 6), A431 (lane 9), MOLT4 (lane 11) and K562 (lane 12) the ratio of full length to the isoforms was altered when compared to normal mammary gland. It should be noted that RNAase protection assay does not distinguish between BRCA1a and BRCA1b transcripts. Effect of BRCA1a and BRCA1b on GAL4-Elk1 Transcriptional Activation Elk-1 is an ETS-like gene that codes for a DNA binding protein that is involved in transcriptional activation, proliferation, differentiation, an activator of MAP kinases and induces apoptosis [ Shao, et al., 1998 ; Rao, et al., 1989 ; Hipskind, et al., 1991 ; Rao, 1994 ]. Elk-1 forms a ternary complex in conjunction with the serum response element (SRE) and serum response factor (SRF) to activate c-Fos [ Rao, 1994 ]. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown the splice variants BRCA1a and BRCA1b to associate with Elk-1 and to inhibit MAP kinase induced activity of c-Fos [ Chai, et al., 2001 ]. In order to determine any difference between wild type and mutant BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins on GAL4-Elk1 transcriptional activation, MCF7 breast cancer cells and HLR-ELK1 cells were transfected with various concentrations of BRCA1a and BRCA1b. HLR-ELK1 cells are a double-stable cell line that contains pFR-Luc and pFA2-Elk1 plasmids stably integrated within their genome. Phosphorylation of the transcriptional activation domain of Elk-1 by MAP kinase will activate transcription of a luciferase reporter plasmid in these cells. Luciferase activity levels serve as an indication of the activation or repression of signaling events. Similarly, MCF7 breast cancer cells were cotransfected with GAL4-Elk1 (305-428), MEK, E1bLuciferase reporter and pCMV ?– Gal and various concentrations of BRCA1a and BRCA1b. Both BRCA1a and BRCA1b were shown to decrease the relative luciferase activity as compared to the empty vector control ( Figure 4a ), indicating inhibition of Elk1 transcriptional activity. Because HLR-ELK1 cells already contain Elk1 and a luciferase reporter plasmid integrated in the genome, these cells were cotransfected with MEK, pCMV ?–Gal, BRCA1a and BRCA1b. Both BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins were shown to decrease the relative luciferase activity and therefore Elk-1 activity in HLR-ELK1 cells ( Figure 4b ). Several germ line mutations in the BRCA1 gene have been identified and are known to be associated with the early onset of breast and ovarian cancers. The change of a tyrosine to a stop codon at position 1853 of BRCA1 (Y1853 ter mutant) leads to a truncated protein eleven amino acids from the C-terminal end [ Monteiro, et al., 1996 ; Friedman, et al., 1994 ]. Because this mutation is located within the BRCA1 BRCT domain, which is involved in transcriptional activation and protein interactions, it is hypothesized that this mutation will disrupt the ability of BRCA1 to transcriptionally activate or repress Elk-1 [ Monteiro, et al., 1996 ]. MCF7 breast cancer cells and HLR-ELK1 cells were cotransfected with BRCA1a and BRCA1b Y1853 ter mutants. These mutants failed to repress the activation of Elk-1 ( Figures 4a and b ). These results suggest BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins to regulate the activity of ELK-1 protein. Sub cellular Localization of BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins The sub cellular localization of BRCA1 and its splice variants have remained controversial. We have found wild type BRCA1 and BRCA1a to be localized in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm [ Wang, et al., 1997 ; Rao, et al., 1996 ]. Others have shown BRCA1 to be a nuclear protein that resides in secretory granules and also in the cytoplasm [ Chen, et al., 1995 ; Jensen, et al., 1996 ; Thakur, et al., 1997 ; Wang, et al., 1997 ]. Recent studies using immunoelectron microscopy results show endogenous BRCA1 protein to be localized in the mitochondria [ Coene, et al., 2005 ]. To study the localization of BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins within the cell, we have used GFP -tagged BRCA1 proteins. Immunofluorescence in MCF7 cells that have been transfected with EGFP-BRCA1/BRCA1a/BRCA1b using GFP antibodies showed the localization of BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins also in the mitochondria ( Figure5a ). The distribution of BRCA1/BRCA1a/BRCA1b differed between cell to cell as observed previously with BRCA1 using different antibodies ( Wang, et al,. 1997 ; Coene, et al., 2005 ; Rao, et al., 1996 .).

Both endogenous as well as ectopically expressed BRCA1 proteins were found in the nucleus; cytoplasm as well as mitochondria using different BRCA1 antibodies ( Figure 5b ). Coene et al. used confocal and immunoelectron microscopy to illustrate the presence of endogenous BRCA1 in the mitochondria, similar to our results [ Coene, et al., 2005 ]. The EGFP-BRCA1a and EGFP-BRCA1b fusion protein at 137 and 127 kDa, respectively, were also found in mitochondrial, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions with anti-GFP and anti-BRCA1 antibodies via Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence ( Figure 5c ). Western blotting of the mitochondrial fractions with cytochrome C further supports the mitochondrial localization of these proteins ( Figure 5c ). We have found for the first time that epitope-tagged BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins to be located within mitochondria similar to endogenous BRCA1. Based on these observations we can speculate that the mitochondrial localization of BRCA1 proteins may be linked to their apoptotic function. BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins suppress growth of human breast cancer cells BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins have been shown to inhibit the growth of breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer cells [ Chai, et al., 2007 ; Holt, et al., 1996 ; Aprelikova, et al., 1999 ].

These results suggest BRCA1a and BRCA1b to inhibit growth of breast cancer cells similar to BRCA1.  In vivo expression of BRCA1a and BRCA1b Proteins In order to determine if the BRCA1 splice variants could be expressed in vivo , COS-1 cells were transfected with BRCA1a or BRCA1b using FLAG and GFP vectors. Both BRCA1a (110 kDa) and BRCA1b (100 kDa) were expressed in COS1 cells using an anti-FLAG antibody ( Figure 2 ).  In vivo expression of BRCA1a and BRCA1b Proteins In order to determine if the BRCA1 splice variants could be expressed in vivo , COS-1 cells were transfected with BRCA1a or BRCA1b using FLAG and GFP vectors. Both BRCA1a (110 kDa) and BRCA1b (100 kDa) were expressed in COS1 cells using an anti-FLAG antibody ( Figure 2 ).  Discussion In the present report, we have presented data concerning the structure/functional relationship of the BRCA1 splice variants BRCA1a and BRCA1b to wild type BRCA1. Our results compare the in vivo expression, sub cellular localization, transcriptional regulation and growth suppression of BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins. Both variants are missing the majority of the exon 11 sequences (263-1365) while BRCA1b contains an additional deletion of exons 9 and 10. We have studied the expression of BRCA1 and its isoforms using Western blot analysis and RNase protection assays (RPA). BRCA1a/1b was expressed in COS1 cells using FLAG vectors. Using RPA, we were able to illustrate RNA expression of BRCA1 and BRCA1a/BRCA1b in normal human mammary gland and several cancer cells like HBL-100, A-431, CAL-51, COLO 320, HeLa, HL-60, K-562, MCF7, MOLT-4, and NIH: OVCAR-3 and SK-OV-3 ( Figure 3 ). In some of the cancer cells like MCF-7, NIH OVCAR3, A431, MOLT4 and K562 cells the ratio of full length to the isoforms was altered compared to the normal mammary gland. These results suggest that mere down regulation of expression of BRCA1a or BRCA1b can cause cancers. Elk-1 is an ETS-related gene that plays a role in transcriptional activation, proliferation, and differentiation. Elk-1 also induces apoptosis and forms a ternary complex with SRE and SRF to activate the c-Fos gene [ Shao, et al., 1998 ; Rao, et al., 1989 ; Hipskind, et al., 1991 ; Rao, 1994 ]. We have previously shown BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins to associate with Elk-1 and inhibit c-Fos Oncogene activation mediated by MAP kinases [ Chai, et al., 2001 ]. Fos plays a pivotal role in the regulation of normal cell growth and transformation and is induced by growth factors and estrogen in breast cancer cells. To study the effect of wild type and disease associated Y1853 termination mutant BRCA1a/BRCA1b proteins on Elk-1 transcriptional activation we used a GAL4-Elk-1 fusion vector. Phosphorylation of the transcriptional activation domain of Elk-1 by a MAP kinase activates transcription of a luciferase reporter plasmid and the luciferase activity will serve as an indication of signaling events. Our results indicate BRCA1a and BRCA1b to inhibit Elk-1 transcriptional activation as shown by the decrease in luciferase activity in MCF7 breast cancer cells and the double stable cell line HLR-ELK1. Several germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene are located within the BRCA1 C-terminal region [ Mullan, et al., 2006 ; Monteiro, et al., 1996 ; Anderson, et al., 1998 ; Chapman, 1996 ]. The BRCT domain plays an important role in BRCA1 transcriptional activation and interaction with various other proteins. It has been suggested that mutations within this region predispose women to develop cancer due to the inability of BRCA1 to activate the transcription of genes [ Monteiro, et al., 1996 ]. Therefore, we hypothesized that BRCA1a/BRCA1b Y1853 termination mutants would fail to inhibit Elk-1 activation. The results presented in this study show that the mutants were impaired in their ability to inhibit Elk-1 activation. Previously estrogen (E2) -induced activation (phosphorylation) of Elk-1 protein was shown to be an important downstream target of E2-dependent Ras-MAPK signaling to proliferation in breast cancer cells ( Duan, et al., 2001 ). These results suggest that one of the mechanisms whereby BRCA1 isoforms suppress cell growth is through inhibition of Elk-1 transcriptional activation. Our results also indicate that BRCA1 mutations within the BRCT domain predispose women to breast and/or ovarian cancer development by failing to inhibit Elk-1 activation, a gene involved in cell growth and proliferation. As mentioned previously, the sub cellular localization of BRCA1 has been controversial. Researchers have shown BRCA1 to be a mainly nuclear localized protein that is also found in the cytoplasm and secretory granules [ Chen, et al., 1995 ; Jensen, et al., 1996 ; Thakur, et al., 1997 ; Wang, et al., 1997 ; Rao, et al., 1996 ]. More recent studies have illustrated mitochondrial localization of phosphorylated BRCA1 [ Coene, et al., 2005 ]. A variant of BRCA1, BRCA1 delta 672-4095, in which the entire exon 11 sequences is missing, produces a 97 kDa protein that is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm [ Thakur, et al., 1997 ]. This led to the conclusion that there is a nuclear localization signal within exon 11 [ Thakur, et al., 1997 ]. Others have identified a splice variant called BRCA1 delta 11b, which is equivalent to BRCA1a, to be found exclusively in the cytoplasm [ Wilson, et al., 1997 ]. A recently identified BRCA1 locus product, BRCA1-IRIS, whose mRNA contains an uninterrupted open reading frame from codon 1 of full-length BRCA1 and continues 34 triplets into intron 11, has been shown to positively influence DNA replication and is exclusively nuclear and chromatin-associated [ Elshamy, 2004 ; Kvist, et al., 2005 ; Elshamy, 2005 ]. We have previously observed BRCA1 and BRCA1a to be localized to both nucleus as well as cytoplasm [ Wang, et al., 1997 ]. Here we have used immunofluorescence and sub cellular fractionation followed by Western blot analysis to determine the location of BRCA1a/1b within the cell. The results of our immunofluorescence and Western blot studies showed BRCA1a and BRCA1b to be localized both in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The fact that BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins are localized in the nucleus even though they are missing the majority of exon 11 which includes the NLS sequences indicates that the BRCA1 splice variants may contain a cryptic NLS or may use an alternate mechanism for their nuclear import [ Fabbro, et al., 2002 ; Au, 2005 ]. Our studies demonstrate for the first time the mitochondrial localization of BRCA1 splice variants BRCA1a and BRCA1b using immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. The presence of BRCA1a and BRCA1b within the mitochondria seems logical due to the role of BRCA1 and the splice variants in apoptosis [ Henderson, 2005 ; Shao, et al., 1996 ; Fabbro, et al., 2002 ]. Mitochondria synthesize their own DNA [ Coene, et al., 2005 ] but rely upon the cell nucleus for repair, transcription, translation and replication [ Penta, et al., 2001 ]. Mitochondrial DNA mutations and genome instability have been reported in breast cancer [ Penta, et al., 2001 ; Bianchi, et al., 2001 ; Parrella, et al., 2001 ]. Proteins are imported into the mitochondria by a translocation system in the outer and inner membranes [ Paschen, 2001 ]. Although NLS sequences have been identified in BRCA1, no such sequences have been identified that target BRCA1 to mitochondria. Localization of BRCA1, BRCA1a, and BRCA1b in mitochondria leads one to propose that these proteins may also be involved in mitochondrial DNA repair. Therefore, it remains to be determined if patients who develop cancer due to BRCA1 mutations are impaired in apoptotic function due to mislocalization of BRCA1. In summary, the results in this present study show the BRCA1 proteins to be multifunctional proteins that are associated with proteins involved in transcriptional activation and/or repression, cell cycle regulation, growth suppression and apoptosis [ Rosen, et al., 2006 ; Boulton, 2006 ; Wang, et al., 1997 ; Shao, et al., 1996 ; Mullan, et al., 2006 ; Shao, et al., 1998 ; Rao, et al., 1996 ; Lu, 2000 ]. We have compared the structure & function of BRCA1a/1b and compared them to wild type BRCA1 using in vivo expression, RNase protection assays, transcriptional regulation using biologically relevant promoters to study their role in transcriptional activation/repression, growth suppression, and subcellular localization studies using immunofluorescence and Western blotting analysis. We demonstrated the anti proliferative function of BRCA1 proteins using growth suppression assays. The results from these studies suggest that the BRCA1 isoforms have overlapping functions and they possess antiproliferative activity in breast cancer cells. The exon 9,10 and 11 sequences possess two nuclear localization signals and binding domains for p53, Rb, c-Myc, STAT1, Rad50 and Rad51, which are absent in the variants BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins. The absence of this region illustrates that these sequences are not necessary for the growth/tumor suppressor function of the BRCA1 splice variants. Since mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of cancer, we can speculate that the mitochondrial localization of BRCA1 proteins may be functionally significant for the tumor suppressive and apoptotic activity of BRCA1 proteins.  Discussion In the present report, we have presented data concerning the structure/functional relationship of the BRCA1 splice variants BRCA1a and BRCA1b to wild type BRCA1. Our results compare the in vivo expression, sub cellular localization, transcriptional regulation and growth suppression of BRCA1, BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins. Both variants are missing the majority of the exon 11 sequences (263-1365) while BRCA1b contains an additional deletion of exons 9 and 10.
