Therapeutic Targets in Malignant Glioblastoma Microenvironment There is considerable evidence that the tissue microenvironment can suppress cancer, and that microenvironment disruption is required for cancer growth and progression. Distortion of the microenvironment by tumor cells can promote growth, recruit nonmalignant cells that provide physiological resources, and facilitate invasion. Compared to the variable routes taken by cells to become cancers, the response of normal tissue to cancer is relatively consistent such that controlling cancer may be more readily achieved indirectly via the microenvironment. Here, we discuss three ideas about how the microenvironment, consisting of a vasculature, inflammatory cells, immune cells, growth factors and extracellular matrix, might provide therapeutic targets in glioblastoma (GBM) in the context of radiotherapy (RT). First, that viable therapeutic targets exist in the GBM microenvironment; second, that RT alters the microenvironment of tissues and tumors; and third, that potential benefit may be achieved by targeting the microenvironments induced by RT.
