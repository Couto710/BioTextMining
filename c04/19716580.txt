Genomic diversity and interspecies host infection of Macaca fascicularis papillomaviruses (MfPVs) within the alpha papillomavirus ?12 species Alpha human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are among the most common sexually transmitted agents of which a subset causes cervical neoplasia and cancer in humans. Alpha-PVs have also been identified in non-human primates although few studies have systematically characterized such mucosal PVs. We cloned and characterized 10 distinct types of PVs from exfoliated cervicovaginal cells from different populations of female cynomolgus macaques ( Macaca fascicularis ) originating from China and Indonesia. These include 5 novel genotypes and 5 previously identified genotypes found in rhesus ( Macaca mulatta ) (RhPV-1, RhPV-a, RhPV-b and RhPV-d) and cynomolgus macaques (MfPV-a). Type-specific primers were designed to amplify the complete PV genomes using an overlapping PCR method. Four MfPVs were associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The most prevalent virus type was MfPV-3 (formerly RhPV-d), which was identified in 60% of animals with CIN. In addition, the complete genomes of variants of MfPV-3 and RhPV-1 were characterized. These variants are 97.1% and 97.7% similar across the L1 nucleotide sequences with the prototype genomes, respectively. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses indicate that these novel MfPVs cluster together within the alpha PV ?12 species closely related to the ?9 (e.g., HPV16) and ?11 species (e.g., HPV34), and all share a most recent common ancestor. Our data expand the molecular diversity of non-human primate PVs and suggest the recent expansion of alpha PV species groups. Moreover, identification of an overlapping set of MfPVs in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques indicates that non-human primate alpha PVs might not be strictly species specific and that “subtypes” may represent recent divergence of host species or past interspecies infection.  Introduction Cervical cancer is the most frequent gynecologic malignancy and one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in women worldwide ( Parkin and Bray, 2006 ; Parkin et al., 2005 ). Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections and the principal cause of cervical cancer and its precursor, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Papillomaviruses (PVs) comprise a diverse group of small epitheliotropic viruses with circular double-stranded DNA genomes about 8 kb in size. PVs are highly species-specific pathogens that cause proliferation of predominantly epithelial cells in a wide range of host species. For a PV to be recognized as a distinct type, the DNA sequence of the L1 open reading frame (ORF) of the cloned genome should be no more than 90% similar to previously typed PVs; a HPV genome whose L1 nucleotide sequence is greater than 2% and less than 10% different from that of the closest type is defined as “subtype” ( de Villiers et al., 2004 ). Currently, over 100 types of HPVs and 47 types of non-human PVs have been fully characterized. Based on the L1 ORF, PVs have recently been classified into alpha-PV (mucosal/genital), beta-PV (cutaneous), and gamma-PV (cutaneous), in addition to at least 13 other genera ( de Villiers et al., 2004 ). All mucosal HPVs associated with cervical cancer are members of the alpha-PV (?-PV) genus, which collectively contains the largest proportion of currently identified HPV types ( de Villiers et al., 2004 ; Munoz et al., 2003 ). Non-human primate mucosal PVs have been detected from a wide range of apes and monkeys including rhesus ( Macaca mulatta ) and cynomolgus macaques ( Macaca fascicularis ), common ( Pan troglodytes ) and pygmy chimpanzees ( Pan paniscus ), and gorillas ( Gorilla gorilla ) ( Antonsson and Hansson, 2002 ; Chan et al., 1997 ; Van Ranst et al., 1991 ). At least 30 non-human primate PV types have been identified; however, only 3 have been completely characterized. Two chimpanzee PV subtypes, PtPV-1 (Common chimpanzee PV type 1) and PpPV-1 (Pygmy chimpanzee PV type 1), the latter from an oral focal epithelial hyperplasia in the pygmy chimpanzee, cluster into the alpha PV ?10 species group together with HPV6, HPV11 and HPV13 ( Van Ranst et al., 1991 ). RhPV-1, isolated from a rhesus macaque metastatic penile squamous cell carcinoma ( Kloster et al., 1988 ; Ostrow, LaBresh, and Faras, 1991 ), is contained within the ?12 species group and is phylogenetically closely related to HPV16 (?9 species) and HPV34 (?11 species) ( de Villiers et al., 2004 ). In addition, 13 RhPVs previously identified by sequencing small PCR fragments from cervical samples from rhesus monkeys formed three new clades/species within the alpha PV group, which do not include any HPV types ( Chan et al., 1997 ). In a recent survey of naturally occurring PVs associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in female cynomolgus macaques, Wood et al. (2007) identified a PV type (RhPV-d) that was closely related to HPV16, experimentally transmissible, and capable of inducing early cervical neoplasia ( Wood et al., 2007 ). In this study, we characterized macaque PV genomes identified in genital samples from female cynomolgus macaques ( Macaca fascicularis ). Ten distinct macaque PVs were identified, including 5 novel types and 5 types previously identified in rhesus macaques and cynomolgus macaques ( Chan et al., 1997 ). The complete genomes were cloned and characterized to investigate the molecular diversity and the evolutionary history of primate PVs associated with cervical lesions.  Materials and Methods Animal specimens and sampling Adult female cynomolgus macaques ( Macaca fascicularis ) were originally imported from Indonesia and China. Animals originated from 4 separate study groups (A-E). Animals in groups A-D were housed in all-female social groups with no breeding contact for at least 3.5 years, while animals in group E were mixed-origin breeding colony founders with more recent breeding histories ( Table 1 ). Exfoliated cervical cytology samples were obtained as previously described ( Wood et al., 2007 ). All procedures involving these animals were conducted in compliance with State and Federal laws, standards of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and guidelines established by the Wake Forest University Animal Care and Use Committee. PV DNA screening and typing Briefly, DNA was partially purified from exfoliated cervical cells and amplified by PCR using Ampli Taq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with MY09/11, GP5+/6+, and FAP primer sets targeting conserved regions within the L1 gene ( Burk et al., 1996 ; Castle et al., 2002 ; Forslund et al., 1999 ). A subset of PCR-positive samples that failed to hybridize to available probes from previously identified monkey PVs were sequenced to identify novel types and allow the development of additional probes in a reiterative process ( Wood et al., 2007 ). Sequences from PCR products were compared with known PV types from the NCBI GenBank database and the lab database using a BLAST searching algorithm. Viruses with sequences less than 90% similar to previously typed PVs were considered novel MfPVs and further characterized. PV genome cloning and sequencing For genome analysis, type specific primer sets were designed based on available sequences including a consensus region within the E1 ORF to allow amplification of the complete genome in 2 - 3 overlapping fragments ( Terai and Burk, 2001a ; Terai and Burk, 2002 ). Oligonucleotide primer sequences are available from the authors. For overlapping PCR, an equal mixture of the AmpliTaq Gold Taq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) and Pwo Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (High Fidelity, Invitrogen, USA) were utilized as previously described ( Terai and Burk, 2001b ). PCR products of appropriate size were cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) or TOPO TA pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced in the Einstein Sequencing Facility, New York. Subsequent sequencing was performed using primer walking. The complete genomic sequences were compiled from the sequences of overlapping cloned PCR products and were deposited into NCBI/GenBank as described in Table 1 . Phylogenetic analysis and tree construction The concatenated amino acid and nucleotide sequences of early ORFs (E6, E7, E1 and E2) and late ORFs (L2 and L1) from closely related representative PV types were used to evaluate the molecular diversity and phylogenetic relationships of genital macaque PVs. Sequences of the related PVs analyzed in this work are available from the NCBI GenBank database. Sequences were aligned with ClustalX ( Thompson et al., 1997 ) and Codon Align (ver 1.0) (available from website http://www.sinauer.com/hall/ ) software packages as previously described ( Chen et al., 2007 ). MrBayes v3.1.2 ( Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001 ; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003 ) with 10,000,000 cycles for the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was used to generate phylogenetic trees. For Bayesian tree construction, the computer program ModelTest v3.7 ( Posada and Crandall, 1998 ) was used to identify the best evolutionary model; the identified gamma model was set for among-site rate variation and allowed all substitution rates of aligned sequence to be different. Maximum parsimony (MP) and neighbor joining (NJ) trees were calculated by an heuristic search in PAUP* v4.0b10 ( Swofford, 1998 ). For maximum parsimony analyses, amino acid and nucleotide sequences were reduced to parsimony informative sites. Data were bootstrap resampled 1,000 times. In order to assess the relative degrees of incongruence across different node/partition pairs ( Narechania et al., 2005 ), a computational algorithm to test the incongruence length difference (ILD) was performed by treating early and late genes of PVs as separate partitions. The ILD values were calculated with the partition homogeneity test employed in PAUP* v4.0b10 ( Swofford, 1998 ).

The ILD values were calculated with the partition homogeneity test employed in PAUP* v4.0b10 ( Swofford, 1998 ).  Results and Discussion Mucosal PV and cervical neoplasia in macaques PV DNA was detected in 24.9% (45/181) of adult female cynomolgus macaques originating from Indonesia or China ( Table 1 ) ( Wood et al., 2007 ). Characterization of these genomes revealed 5 novel macaque PVs and 5 previously identified types, four in rhesus macaques (RhPV-1, RhPV-a, RhPV-b and RhPV-d) and one in a cynomolgus macaque (MfPV-a) ( Chan et al., 1997 ; Ostrow, LaBresh, and Faras, 1991 ). Except for RhPV-1 that was previously characterized ( Ostrow, LaBresh, and Faras, 1991 ), we cloned and sequenced the complete genomes of these putative novel types that are named Macaca fascicularis PV-number (MfPV-3 to -11) ( Table 1 ). All macaque samples were negative for over 40 common HPVs by oligonucleotide hybridization. Four different macaque PV types were associated with histologically-confirmed CIN (MfPV-3, -4, -5, and -8) ( Table 1 ). Prevalence of different PVs in the collection of samples confirmed that MfPV-3 (formerly RhPV-d in Wood et al. 2007 ) was the most common macaque PV, and we infer that in these animals it was both persistent (based on animals with no breeding contact for over 3.5 years) and oncogenic ( Wood et al., 2007 ). Characterizations of the novel MfPV complete genomes Analysis of novel MfPV genome sequences revealed sizes of 7920 - 8063 bp, with a GC content between 46.02% and 50.35% ( Table 1 ). They all contain the classical six early (E6, E7, E1, E2, E4 and E5) and two late (L2 and L1) ORFs ( Supplement 1 ). The putative E6 ORFs of genital MfPVs contain two zinc-binding domains (CxxC(x)29CxxC), separated by 36 amino acids. An additional upstream in frame ATG was identified in the MfPV-10 and RhPV-1 E6 ORFs ( Supplement 2 ) ( Ostrow, LaBresh, and Faras, 1991 ). However, these upstream nucleotides (MfPV-10, nt 7840-7920; RhPV-1, 7948-8028) overlap a classical TATAA box and potentially encode amino acids not related to the canonical E6 genes of the other genital MfPV types, making it unlikely to be the E6 translation initiation codon. Accordingly, we suggest that a conserved downstream ATG of the E6 ORF is the translational start site and we use it to position the first nucleotide of the complete genome ( Supplement 1 ). All MfPV E6s have a splice donor / acceptor pair that allows them to generate a spliced E6 (E6*) (data not shown). Alpha HPVs associated with malignant progression (e.g., HPV16, HPV18) have splice donor / acceptor sites and generate a small protein corresponding to E6*, which appears to be critical in the generation of an mRNA for E7 expression. In contrast, viruses lacking this splice donor / acceptor site (e.g., HPV11, HPV6) transcribe a major collinear E6-E7 mRNA, responsible for generation of E7 from a promoter located within the E6 gene ( Sedman et al., 1991 ; Smotkin, Prokoph, and Wettstein, 1989 ). Interestingly, a PDZ-binding motif (x-T/S-x-V/L), which is highly conserved in alpha PV ?5-7, ?9, ?11 species HPV E6s, many of which are associated with cancer, is present in the carboxy terminus of MfPV-3, -4, -6, -7, -8 -10 and -11, but absent in that of MfPV-5, -9 and RhPV-1. PDZ-domain-containing proteins are involved in a variety of cellular functions such as cell signaling and cell adhesion. High-risk HPV E6s (e.g., HPV16, HPV18) but not low-risk HPV E6s (e.g., HPV6, HPV11) have been shown to interact with these proteins through the C-terminal motif, leading to their degradation ( Kiyono et al., 1997 ). However, RhPV-1 isolated from a penile squamous cell carcinoma ( Schneider et al., 1991 ) lacks a PDZ-binding motif indicating that this motif may not be essential to E6-induced carcinogenesis and host cell transformation. Alternatively, other virus protein functions may complement the lack of a PDZ binding domain. The putative E7 ORFs of these genital MfPVs contain a conserved zinc-binding domain, CxxC(x)29CxxC, and a pRB binding motif (LxCxE). Similar to genital HPV types, the carboxy-terminal region of the E1 proteins contains the highly conserved binding site of the ATP-dependent helicase (GPP/ANTGKS). Although both the putative E4 and E5 ORFs show significant homology with known HPV E4 and E5 genes (e.g., HPV16, HPV34), no initiation / start codon was identified, suggesting that these ORFs are translated from a spliced transcript. These macaque PVs contain E5 homologues to carcinogenic alpha HPVs within the ?5 -7, ?9 and ?11 species, and the members of the ?1, ?8 and ?10 species causing venereal warts ( Schiffman et al., 2005 ). A polyadenylation consensus sequence (AATAAA) for processing of early viral mRNA transcripts is present at the beginning of the L2 gene. The major (L1) and minor (L2) capsid proteins of both types contain a nuclear localization signal at their 3? end. The upstream regulatory regions (URRs) of genital MfPVs is located between the stop codon of L1 and the first start codon of the E6 ORF consisting of 764 - 803 bp, similar in length to the URRs of alpha HPVs, and contain many cis -acting regulatory sequences that control viral transcription and replication ( Supplement 3 ). Four canonical palindromic E2-binding sites [ACC(N)6GGT] are present within the URR regions of all genital MfPVs, with an E1 binding site located between two E2-binding sites. Binding sites for transcriptional regulatory factors including AP-1 ( Chan et al., 1990 ), NF-1 ( Apt et al., 1993 ), SP-1 ( Gloss and Bernard, 1990 ), transcriptional enhancer factors (TEF)-1 ( Ishiji et al., 1992 ), and YY-1 ( Dong et al., 1994 ) were also present within the URR regions. Regulatory sites include a polyadenylation site (AATAAA) processing L1 / L2 capsid mRNA transcripts at the URR 5? end (except for RhPV-1), and a TATA box representing the E6/E7 promoter at the 3? end ( Supplement 3 ). Phylogeny of mucosal MfPVs In order to assess the phylogenetic relationships of these novel primate PVs, trees inferred from the concatenated amino acids and nucleotide sequences of early ORFs (E6, E7, E1, and E2) and late ORFs (L2 and L1) were constructed using multiple algorithms ( Fig. 1 ). Representative types within the alpha HPVs were selected for analysis. Three cutaneous types, HPV4, HPV5 and MfPV-1 (NCBI access number EF028290, unpublished), were set as the “referent out-group”. The topologies strongly support the existence of a monophyletic clade grouping MfPV-3 to -11 together with RhPV-1, expanding the genomic diversity of the ?12 species ( Fig. 1a ). The members of the ?12 species are closely related to the members of ?9 (HPV16) and ?11 species (HPV34), suggesting that these three species share a most recent common ancestor (MRCA). Within the ?12 species, however, the position of RhPV-1 is variable depending on the region used for phylogeny. In the “late ORF” trees, RhPV-1 is most closely related to MfPV-3 and -10, while the “early ORF” trees revealed similar distances of RhPV-1 to MfPV-3/-10 and MfPV-4/-5/-9 clades (ILD-test p-value = 0.001) ( Fig. 1b ). It has been demonstrated that incongruence of phylogeny exists among different ORFs/regions of alpha PVs ( Narechania et al., 2005 ). Natural selection appears to have converged on either a single solution for the late genes or a single solution for oncogenicity. The variable position of RhPV-1 within the ?12 species in the tree topologies between early and late genes indicates that such selection may occur at any time during PV evolution, suggesting that selective pressure works differently on separate parts of the genome. Recombination has recently been suggested as a possible driving force in the evolution of PVs ( Rector et al., 2008 ); however, we did not detect any proof for recombination of MfPVs (data not shown). Previous phylogenetic analysis has revealed that HPVs form three main clusters; the alpha-PV genus contains types infecting mucosal/genital lesions, while types associated with cutaneous lesions or epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) make up the beta- and gamma-PV genera ( de Villiers et al., 2004 ). Interestingly, primate PVs with similar tissue tropism (mucosal vs cutaneous) cluster together, rather than PV types infecting the same primate host species. For example, MfPVs from mucosal lesions of macaques cluster into the alpha PV group (e.g., MfPV-3 to -11) ( Chan et al., 1997 ), while cutaneous MfPV-1 is closely related to HPV5 within the beta-gene ( Fig. 1a ). Some PV types from healthy skin of non-human primate animals distribute into the beta- and gamma-PVs ( Antonsson and Hansson, 2002 ), supporting evolution of PVs adapted to specific biological niches. Taken together, these data suggest that divergence of a common ancient PV into different host ecosystems ( Grice et al., 2009 ) (e.g., tissue tropisms -- genital/mucosal vs cutaneous) must have existed prior to primate host speciation events, followed by the co-evolution of these ancestral viruses with their hosts to give rise to the wide radiation among primate PVs. Genomic diversity of mucosal MfPVs Alignments and comparisons of the L1 and E1 ORFs of these genital MfPVs (MfPV-3 to -11 and RhPV-1) indicate that they are most closely related to each other, sharing on average 77.7% (73.2 - 86.5%) and 76.8% (70.7 - 90.5%) nucleotide similarity across the L1 and E1 ORFs, respectively ( Supplement 4 ). Phylogenetic analyses classified these macaque PVs as a clade within the previously designated ?12 species ( Fig. 1 ). As a group, they share approximately 70.1% and 65.9% similarities within the respective L1 and E1 ORFs with their closest relatives, the ?9 (e.g., HPV16) and ?11 species (e.g., HPV34) ( de Villiers et al., 2004 ). Two chimpanzee PV subtypes, PtPV-1 and PpPV-1, are grouped within the ?10 species (e.g., HPV11 and HPV13), sharing approximately 87.4% (L1) and 90.1% (E1) similarities with HPV13, and approximately 66.9% (L1) and 64.0% (E1) similarities with members of the ?12 species. MfPV-1 was isolated from skin warts removed from the extremities of a cynomolgus macaque and shares 74.5% and 73.8% similarities with HPV-5, a member of the cutaneous beta-PV group, while on average only 60.8% and 57.5% similarities with the ?12 species MfPVs within the L1 and E1 ORFs, respectively. These findings support the idea that viral adaption to a host ecosystem (e.g., tissue tropism -- mucosal vs cutaneous) drives the phylogenetic positions of primate PVs more than host phylogeny, arguing against the strict application of virus-host co-evolution ( Hafner and Nadler, 1988 ). Variants of MfPV-3 and RhPV-1 Variants of MfPV-3 and RhPV-1 isolated from different geographic regions (China vs Indonesia) were cloned and sequenced to determine variations across the genome ( Table 1 ). The virus isolated from sample Mac171 is 2.9% (L1) and 2.8% (E1) dissimilar with MfPV-3 prototype (sample Mac26), respectively; this variant represents another lineage of MfPV-3 and was named MfPV-3b. Two variants of RhPV-1, named RhPV-1b (isolates Mac170 and Mac686) share 99.8% (L1) and 99.6% (E1) similarities to each other, and 97.7% (L1) and 97.1% (E1) similarities with the RhPV-1 prototype, respectively. As shown in Figure 2 , variations can be determined across all of 8 ORFs, while indel (insertion and/or deletion) events only occur within the non-codon regions (NCR) including the URR (upstream regular region), NCR1 (region between E2 and E5 ORFs), and NCR2 (region between E5 and L2 ORFs). Among variants, the ratio of the number of non-synonymous changes to the number of synonymous changes per codon was >1 within the E4, E5, E6 and E7 ORFs for RhPV-1 and the E5 and E6 ORFs for MfPV-3, suggesting potential Darwinian selection within these ORFs. MfPV-3 and RhPV-1 variants are 3.8% dissimilar (both types) across the complete genomes. This is more variable than HPV16 European and non-European variants (2.3%), and HPV18 African and non-African variants (2.6%) ( Chen et al., 2009 ; Chen et al., 2005 ). Assuming similar evolutionary rates among alpha PVs, the variants of MfPVs diverged from their MRCAs longer ago than that of HPVs, suggesting an earlier origin of MfPVs (Chen et. al., manuscript in preparation). Interspecies host infection of MfPVs The nucleotide sequences of the MY09/11 region within the L1 ORF of MfPV-3, -5, -8 and -11 share >90% similarities with PCR fragment sequences reported from a previous study ( Chan et al., 1997 ). This allowed us to classify MfPV-5 as a variant of MfPV-a (100% similarity), while MfPV-3 is a subtype of RhPV-d (93.9% similarity), MfPV-8 is a subtype of RhPV-a (94.6% similarity), and MfPV-11 is a subtype of RhPV-b (93.2% similarity) ( Table 1 ). We identified an overlapping set of PVs for MfPV-3, -8, -11 and RhPV-1 infecting both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques ( Chan et al., 1997 ). Interestingly, variants of MfPV-3, -8 and -11 isolated from different species of macaques (cynomolgus vs rhesus) showed variability consistent with “subtypes” ( Table 1 ). Accordingly, two chimpanzee PV subtypes, PtPV-1 and PpPV-1, sharing 93.2% similarity across the L1 nucleotide sequence, were also isolated from different species of chimpanzees (common and pygmy chimpanzees, respectively). This suggests that (non-human primate) alpha PVs might not be strictly species-specific and that “subtypes” may represent more recent divergence of host species or past interspecies infection ( Tosi, Morales, and Melnick, 2002 ). While areas of hydribization between cynomolgus and rhesus macaques have been described (in regions of Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand) ( Tosi, Morales, and Melnick, 2002 ), it should be noted that no species overlap exists in the area of Indonesia (Bogor) where all Indonesian animals surveyed in this study originated. However, RhPV-1 variants infecting cynomolgus and rhesus macaques appear to be an exception, with L1 dissimilarities less than 3%. Identification of additional RhPV-1 variants in rhesus macaques would help further address the questions of alpha PV genomic diversity and possible genetic factors involved in interspecies host infection.  Results and Discussion Mucosal PV and cervical neoplasia in macaques PV DNA was detected in 24.9% (45/181) of adult female cynomolgus macaques originating from Indonesia or China ( Table 1 ) ( Wood et al., 2007 ). Characterization of these genomes revealed 5 novel macaque PVs and 5 previously identified types, four in rhesus macaques (RhPV-1, RhPV-a, RhPV-b and RhPV-d) and one in a cynomolgus macaque (MfPV-a) ( Chan et al., 1997 ; Ostrow, LaBresh, and Faras, 1991 ).

All MfPV E6s have a splice donor / acceptor pair that allows them to generate a spliced E6 (E6*) (data not shown). Alpha HPVs associated with malignant progression (e.g., HPV16, HPV18) have splice donor / acceptor sites and generate a small protein corresponding to E6*, which appears to be critical in the generation of an mRNA for E7 expression. In contrast, viruses lacking this splice donor / acceptor site (e.g., HPV11, HPV6) transcribe a major collinear E6-E7 mRNA, responsible for generation of E7 from a promoter located within the E6 gene ( Sedman et al., 1991 ; Smotkin, Prokoph, and Wettstein, 1989 ). Interestingly, a PDZ-binding motif (x-T/S-x-V/L), which is highly conserved in alpha PV ?5-7, ?9, ?11 species HPV E6s, many of which are associated with cancer, is present in the carboxy terminus of MfPV-3, -4, -6, -7, -8 -10 and -11, but absent in that of MfPV-5, -9 and RhPV-1. PDZ-domain-containing proteins are involved in a variety of cellular functions such as cell signaling and cell adhesion. High-risk HPV E6s (e.g., HPV16, HPV18) but not low-risk HPV E6s (e.g., HPV6, HPV11) have been shown to interact with these proteins through the C-terminal motif, leading to their degradation ( Kiyono et al., 1997 ). However, RhPV-1 isolated from a penile squamous cell carcinoma ( Schneider et al., 1991 ) lacks a PDZ-binding motif indicating that this motif may not be essential to E6-induced carcinogenesis and host cell transformation. Alternatively, other virus protein functions may complement the lack of a PDZ binding domain. The putative E7 ORFs of these genital MfPVs contain a conserved zinc-binding domain, CxxC(x)29CxxC, and a pRB binding motif (LxCxE). Similar to genital HPV types, the carboxy-terminal region of the E1 proteins contains the highly conserved binding site of the ATP-dependent helicase (GPP/ANTGKS). Although both the putative E4 and E5 ORFs show significant homology with known HPV E4 and E5 genes (e.g., HPV16, HPV34), no initiation / start codon was identified, suggesting that these ORFs are translated from a spliced transcript. These macaque PVs contain E5 homologues to carcinogenic alpha HPVs within the ?5 -7, ?9 and ?11 species, and the members of the ?1, ?8 and ?10 species causing venereal warts ( Schiffman et al., 2005 ). A polyadenylation consensus sequence (AATAAA) for processing of early viral mRNA transcripts is present at the beginning of the L2 gene. The major (L1) and minor (L2) capsid proteins of both types contain a nuclear localization signal at their 3? end. The upstream regulatory regions (URRs) of genital MfPVs is located between the stop codon of L1 and the first start codon of the E6 ORF consisting of 764 - 803 bp, similar in length to the URRs of alpha HPVs, and contain many cis -acting regulatory sequences that control viral transcription and replication ( Supplement 3 ). Four canonical palindromic E2-binding sites [ACC(N)6GGT] are present within the URR regions of all genital MfPVs, with an E1 binding site located between two E2-binding sites. Binding sites for transcriptional regulatory factors including AP-1 ( Chan et al., 1990 ), NF-1 ( Apt et al., 1993 ), SP-1 ( Gloss and Bernard, 1990 ), transcriptional enhancer factors (TEF)-1 ( Ishiji et al., 1992 ), and YY-1 ( Dong et al., 1994 ) were also present within the URR regions. Regulatory sites include a polyadenylation site (AATAAA) processing L1 / L2 capsid mRNA transcripts at the URR 5? end (except for RhPV-1), and a TATA box representing the E6/E7 promoter at the 3? end ( Supplement 3 ). Phylogeny of mucosal MfPVs In order to assess the phylogenetic relationships of these novel primate PVs, trees inferred from the concatenated amino acids and nucleotide sequences of early ORFs (E6, E7, E1, and E2) and late ORFs (L2 and L1) were constructed using multiple algorithms ( Fig. 1 ). Representative types within the alpha HPVs were selected for analysis. Three cutaneous types, HPV4, HPV5 and MfPV-1 (NCBI access number EF028290, unpublished), were set as the “referent out-group”. The topologies strongly support the existence of a monophyletic clade grouping MfPV-3 to -11 together with RhPV-1, expanding the genomic diversity of the ?12 species ( Fig. 1a ). The members of the ?12 species are closely related to the members of ?9 (HPV16) and ?11 species (HPV34), suggesting that these three species share a most recent common ancestor (MRCA). Within the ?12 species, however, the position of RhPV-1 is variable depending on the region used for phylogeny. In the “late ORF” trees, RhPV-1 is most closely related to MfPV-3 and -10, while the “early ORF” trees revealed similar distances of RhPV-1 to MfPV-3/-10 and MfPV-4/-5/-9 clades (ILD-test p-value = 0.001) ( Fig. 1b ). It has been demonstrated that incongruence of phylogeny exists among different ORFs/regions of alpha PVs ( Narechania et al., 2005 ). Natural selection appears to have converged on either a single solution for the late genes or a single solution for oncogenicity. The variable position of RhPV-1 within the ?12 species in the tree topologies between early and late genes indicates that such selection may occur at any time during PV evolution, suggesting that selective pressure works differently on separate parts of the genome. Recombination has recently been suggested as a possible driving force in the evolution of PVs ( Rector et al., 2008 ); however, we did not detect any proof for recombination of MfPVs (data not shown). Previous phylogenetic analysis has revealed that HPVs form three main clusters; the alpha-PV genus contains types infecting mucosal/genital lesions, while types associated with cutaneous lesions or epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) make up the beta- and gamma-PV genera ( de Villiers et al., 2004 ). Interestingly, primate PVs with similar tissue tropism (mucosal vs cutaneous) cluster together, rather than PV types infecting the same primate host species. For example, MfPVs from mucosal lesions of macaques cluster into the alpha PV group (e.g., MfPV-3 to -11) ( Chan et al., 1997 ), while cutaneous MfPV-1 is closely related to HPV5 within the beta-gene ( Fig. 1a ). Some PV types from healthy skin of non-human primate animals distribute into the beta- and gamma-PVs ( Antonsson and Hansson, 2002 ), supporting evolution of PVs adapted to specific biological niches. Taken together, these data suggest that divergence of a common ancient PV into different host ecosystems ( Grice et al., 2009 ) (e.g., tissue tropisms -- genital/mucosal vs cutaneous) must have existed prior to primate host speciation events, followed by the co-evolution of these ancestral viruses with their hosts to give rise to the wide radiation among primate PVs. Genomic diversity of mucosal MfPVs Alignments and comparisons of the L1 and E1 ORFs of these genital MfPVs (MfPV-3 to -11 and RhPV-1) indicate that they are most closely related to each other, sharing on average 77.7% (73.2 - 86.5%) and 76.8% (70.7 - 90.5%) nucleotide similarity across the L1 and E1 ORFs, respectively ( Supplement 4 ). Phylogenetic analyses classified these macaque PVs as a clade within the previously designated ?12 species ( Fig. 1 ). As a group, they share approximately 70.1% and 65.9% similarities within the respective L1 and E1 ORFs with their closest relatives, the ?9 (e.g., HPV16) and ?11 species (e.g., HPV34) ( de Villiers et al., 2004 ). Two chimpanzee PV subtypes, PtPV-1 and PpPV-1, are grouped within the ?10 species (e.g., HPV11 and HPV13), sharing approximately 87.4% (L1) and 90.1% (E1) similarities with HPV13, and approximately 66.9% (L1) and 64.0% (E1) similarities with members of the ?12 species. MfPV-1 was isolated from skin warts removed from the extremities of a cynomolgus macaque and shares 74.5% and 73.8% similarities with HPV-5, a member of the cutaneous beta-PV group, while on average only 60.8% and 57.5% similarities with the ?12 species MfPVs within the L1 and E1 ORFs, respectively. These findings support the idea that viral adaption to a host ecosystem (e.g., tissue tropism -- mucosal vs cutaneous) drives the phylogenetic positions of primate PVs more than host phylogeny, arguing against the strict application of virus-host co-evolution ( Hafner and Nadler, 1988 ). Variants of MfPV-3 and RhPV-1 Variants of MfPV-3 and RhPV-1 isolated from different geographic regions (China vs Indonesia) were cloned and sequenced to determine variations across the genome ( Table 1 ). The virus isolated from sample Mac171 is 2.9% (L1) and 2.8% (E1) dissimilar with MfPV-3 prototype (sample Mac26), respectively; this variant represents another lineage of MfPV-3 and was named MfPV-3b. Two variants of RhPV-1, named RhPV-1b (isolates Mac170 and Mac686) share 99.8% (L1) and 99.6% (E1) similarities to each other, and 97.7% (L1) and 97.1% (E1) similarities with the RhPV-1 prototype, respectively. As shown in Figure 2 , variations can be determined across all of 8 ORFs, while indel (insertion and/or deletion) events only occur within the non-codon regions (NCR) including the URR (upstream regular region), NCR1 (region between E2 and E5 ORFs), and NCR2 (region between E5 and L2 ORFs). Among variants, the ratio of the number of non-synonymous changes to the number of synonymous changes per codon was >1 within the E4, E5, E6 and E7 ORFs for RhPV-1 and the E5 and E6 ORFs for MfPV-3, suggesting potential Darwinian selection within these ORFs. MfPV-3 and RhPV-1 variants are 3.8% dissimilar (both types) across the complete genomes. This is more variable than HPV16 European and non-European variants (2.3%), and HPV18 African and non-African variants (2.6%) ( Chen et al., 2009 ; Chen et al., 2005 ). Assuming similar evolutionary rates among alpha PVs, the variants of MfPVs diverged from their MRCAs longer ago than that of HPVs, suggesting an earlier origin of MfPVs (Chen et. al., manuscript in preparation). Interspecies host infection of MfPVs The nucleotide sequences of the MY09/11 region within the L1 ORF of MfPV-3, -5, -8 and -11 share >90% similarities with PCR fragment sequences reported from a previous study ( Chan et al., 1997 ). This allowed us to classify MfPV-5 as a variant of MfPV-a (100% similarity), while MfPV-3 is a subtype of RhPV-d (93.9% similarity), MfPV-8 is a subtype of RhPV-a (94.6% similarity), and MfPV-11 is a subtype of RhPV-b (93.2% similarity) ( Table 1 ). We identified an overlapping set of PVs for MfPV-3, -8, -11 and RhPV-1 infecting both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques ( Chan et al., 1997 ). Interestingly, variants of MfPV-3, -8 and -11 isolated from different species of macaques (cynomolgus vs rhesus) showed variability consistent with “subtypes” ( Table 1 ). Accordingly, two chimpanzee PV subtypes, PtPV-1 and PpPV-1, sharing 93.2% similarity across the L1 nucleotide sequence, were also isolated from different species of chimpanzees (common and pygmy chimpanzees, respectively). This suggests that (non-human primate) alpha PVs might not be strictly species-specific and that “subtypes” may represent more recent divergence of host species or past interspecies infection ( Tosi, Morales, and Melnick, 2002 ). While areas of hydribization between cynomolgus and rhesus macaques have been described (in regions of Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand) ( Tosi, Morales, and Melnick, 2002 ), it should be noted that no species overlap exists in the area of Indonesia (Bogor) where all Indonesian animals surveyed in this study originated. However, RhPV-1 variants infecting cynomolgus and rhesus macaques appear to be an exception, with L1 dissimilarities less than 3%. Identification of additional RhPV-1 variants in rhesus macaques would help further address the questions of alpha PV genomic diversity and possible genetic factors involved in interspecies host infection.  Mucosal PV and cervical neoplasia in macaques PV DNA was detected in 24.9% (45/181) of adult female cynomolgus macaques originating from Indonesia or China ( Table 1 ) ( Wood et al., 2007 ). Characterization of these genomes revealed 5 novel macaque PVs and 5 previously identified types, four in rhesus macaques (RhPV-1, RhPV-a, RhPV-b and RhPV-d) and one in a cynomolgus macaque (MfPV-a) ( Chan et al., 1997 ; Ostrow, LaBresh, and Faras, 1991 ). Except for RhPV-1 that was previously characterized ( Ostrow, LaBresh, and Faras, 1991 ), we cloned and sequenced the complete genomes of these putative novel types that are named Macaca fascicularis PV-number (MfPV-3 to -11) ( Table 1 ). All macaque samples were negative for over 40 common HPVs by oligonucleotide hybridization. Four different macaque PV types were associated with histologically-confirmed CIN (MfPV-3, -4, -5, and -8) ( Table 1 ). Prevalence of different PVs in the collection of samples confirmed that MfPV-3 (formerly RhPV-d in Wood et al. 2007 ) was the most common macaque PV, and we infer that in these animals it was both persistent (based on animals with no breeding contact for over 3.5 years) and oncogenic ( Wood et al., 2007 ).  Mucosal PV and cervical neoplasia in macaques PV DNA was detected in 24.9% (45/181) of adult female cynomolgus macaques originating from Indonesia or China ( Table 1 ) ( Wood et al., 2007 ). Characterization of these genomes revealed 5 novel macaque PVs and 5 previously identified types, four in rhesus macaques (RhPV-1, RhPV-a, RhPV-b and RhPV-d) and one in a cynomolgus macaque (MfPV-a) ( Chan et al., 1997 ; Ostrow, LaBresh, and Faras, 1991 ). Except for RhPV-1 that was previously characterized ( Ostrow, LaBresh, and Faras, 1991 ), we cloned and sequenced the complete genomes of these putative novel types that are named Macaca fascicularis PV-number (MfPV-3 to -11) ( Table 1 ). All macaque samples were negative for over 40 common HPVs by oligonucleotide hybridization. Four different macaque PV types were associated with histologically-confirmed CIN (MfPV-3, -4, -5, and -8) ( Table 1 ). Prevalence of different PVs in the collection of samples confirmed that MfPV-3 (formerly RhPV-d in Wood et al. 2007 ) was the most common macaque PV, and we infer that in these animals it was both persistent (based on animals with no breeding contact for over 3.5 years) and oncogenic ( Wood et al., 2007 ).  Characterizations of the novel MfPV complete genomes Analysis of novel MfPV genome sequences revealed sizes of 7920 - 8063 bp, with a GC content between 46.02% and 50.35% ( Table 1 ). They all contain the classical six early (E6, E7, E1, E2, E4 and E5) and two late (L2 and L1) ORFs ( Supplement 1 ). The putative E6 ORFs of genital MfPVs contain two zinc-binding domains (CxxC(x)29CxxC), separated by 36 amino acids. An additional upstream in frame ATG was identified in the MfPV-10 and RhPV-1 E6 ORFs ( Supplement 2 ) ( Ostrow, LaBresh, and Faras, 1991 ). However, these upstream nucleotides (MfPV-10, nt 7840-7920; RhPV-1, 7948-8028) overlap a classical TATAA box and potentially encode amino acids not related to the canonical E6 genes of the other genital MfPV types, making it unlikely to be the E6 translation initiation codon. Accordingly, we suggest that a conserved downstream ATG of the E6 ORF is the translational start site and we use it to position the first nucleotide of the complete genome ( Supplement 1 ). All MfPV E6s have a splice donor / acceptor pair that allows them to generate a spliced E6 (E6*) (data not shown). Alpha HPVs associated with malignant progression (e.g., HPV16, HPV18) have splice donor / acceptor sites and generate a small protein corresponding to E6*, which appears to be critical in the generation of an mRNA for E7 expression. In contrast, viruses lacking this splice donor / acceptor site (e.g., HPV11, HPV6) transcribe a major collinear E6-E7 mRNA, responsible for generation of E7 from a promoter located within the E6 gene ( Sedman et al., 1991 ; Smotkin, Prokoph, and Wettstein, 1989 ). Interestingly, a PDZ-binding motif (x-T/S-x-V/L), which is highly conserved in alpha PV ?5-7, ?9, ?11 species HPV E6s, many of which are associated with cancer, is present in the carboxy terminus of MfPV-3, -4, -6, -7, -8 -10 and -11, but absent in that of MfPV-5, -9 and RhPV-1. PDZ-domain-containing proteins are involved in a variety of cellular functions such as cell signaling and cell adhesion. High-risk HPV E6s (e.g., HPV16, HPV18) but not low-risk HPV E6s (e.g., HPV6, HPV11) have been shown to interact with these proteins through the C-terminal motif, leading to their degradation ( Kiyono et al., 1997 ). However, RhPV-1 isolated from a penile squamous cell carcinoma ( Schneider et al., 1991 ) lacks a PDZ-binding motif indicating that this motif may not be essential to E6-induced carcinogenesis and host cell transformation. Alternatively, other virus protein functions may complement the lack of a PDZ binding domain. The putative E7 ORFs of these genital MfPVs contain a conserved zinc-binding domain, CxxC(x)29CxxC, and a pRB binding motif (LxCxE). Similar to genital HPV types, the carboxy-terminal region of the E1 proteins contains the highly conserved binding site of the ATP-dependent helicase (GPP/ANTGKS). Although both the putative E4 and E5 ORFs show significant homology with known HPV E4 and E5 genes (e.g., HPV16, HPV34), no initiation / start codon was identified, suggesting that these ORFs are translated from a spliced transcript. These macaque PVs contain E5 homologues to carcinogenic alpha HPVs within the ?5 -7, ?9 and ?11 species, and the members of the ?1, ?8 and ?10 species causing venereal warts ( Schiffman et al., 2005 ). A polyadenylation consensus sequence (AATAAA) for processing of early viral mRNA transcripts is present at the beginning of the L2 gene. The major (L1) and minor (L2) capsid proteins of both types contain a nuclear localization signal at their 3? end. The upstream regulatory regions (URRs) of genital MfPVs is located between the stop codon of L1 and the first start codon of the E6 ORF consisting of 764 - 803 bp, similar in length to the URRs of alpha HPVs, and contain many cis -acting regulatory sequences that control viral transcription and replication ( Supplement 3 ). Four canonical palindromic E2-binding sites [ACC(N)6GGT] are present within the URR regions of all genital MfPVs, with an E1 binding site located between two E2-binding sites. Binding sites for transcriptional regulatory factors including AP-1 ( Chan et al., 1990 ), NF-1 ( Apt et al., 1993 ), SP-1 ( Gloss and Bernard, 1990 ), transcriptional enhancer factors (TEF)-1 ( Ishiji et al., 1992 ), and YY-1 ( Dong et al., 1994 ) were also present within the URR regions. Regulatory sites include a polyadenylation site (AATAAA) processing L1 / L2 capsid mRNA transcripts at the URR 5? end (except for RhPV-1), and a TATA box representing the E6/E7 promoter at the 3? end ( Supplement 3 ).

Phylogeny of mucosal MfPVs In order to assess the phylogenetic relationships of these novel primate PVs, trees inferred from the concatenated amino acids and nucleotide sequences of early ORFs (E6, E7, E1, and E2) and late ORFs (L2 and L1) were constructed using multiple algorithms ( Fig. 1 ). Representative types within the alpha HPVs were selected for analysis. Three cutaneous types, HPV4, HPV5 and MfPV-1 (NCBI access number EF028290, unpublished), were set as the “referent out-group”. The topologies strongly support the existence of a monophyletic clade grouping MfPV-3 to -11 together with RhPV-1, expanding the genomic diversity of the ?12 species ( Fig. 1a ). The members of the ?12 species are closely related to the members of ?9 (HPV16) and ?11 species (HPV34), suggesting that these three species share a most recent common ancestor (MRCA). Within the ?12 species, however, the position of RhPV-1 is variable depending on the region used for phylogeny. In the “late ORF” trees, RhPV-1 is most closely related to MfPV-3 and -10, while the “early ORF” trees revealed similar distances of RhPV-1 to MfPV-3/-10 and MfPV-4/-5/-9 clades (ILD-test p-value = 0.001) ( Fig. 1b ). It has been demonstrated that incongruence of phylogeny exists among different ORFs/regions of alpha PVs ( Narechania et al., 2005 ). Natural selection appears to have converged on either a single solution for the late genes or a single solution for oncogenicity. The variable position of RhPV-1 within the ?12 species in the tree topologies between early and late genes indicates that such selection may occur at any time during PV evolution, suggesting that selective pressure works differently on separate parts of the genome. Recombination has recently been suggested as a possible driving force in the evolution of PVs ( Rector et al., 2008 ); however, we did not detect any proof for recombination of MfPVs (data not shown). Previous phylogenetic analysis has revealed that HPVs form three main clusters; the alpha-PV genus contains types infecting mucosal/genital lesions, while types associated with cutaneous lesions or epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) make up the beta- and gamma-PV genera ( de Villiers et al., 2004 ).

For example, MfPVs from mucosal lesions of macaques cluster into the alpha PV group (e.g., MfPV-3 to -11) ( Chan et al., 1997 ), while cutaneous MfPV-1 is closely related to HPV5 within the beta-gene ( Fig. 1a ). Some PV types from healthy skin of non-human primate animals distribute into the beta- and gamma-PVs ( Antonsson and Hansson, 2002 ), supporting evolution of PVs adapted to specific biological niches. Taken together, these data suggest that divergence of a common ancient PV into different host ecosystems ( Grice et al., 2009 ) (e.g., tissue tropisms -- genital/mucosal vs cutaneous) must have existed prior to primate host speciation events, followed by the co-evolution of these ancestral viruses with their hosts to give rise to the wide radiation among primate PVs.

Some PV types from healthy skin of non-human primate animals distribute into the beta- and gamma-PVs ( Antonsson and Hansson, 2002 ), supporting evolution of PVs adapted to specific biological niches. Taken together, these data suggest that divergence of a common ancient PV into different host ecosystems ( Grice et al., 2009 ) (e.g., tissue tropisms -- genital/mucosal vs cutaneous) must have existed prior to primate host speciation events, followed by the co-evolution of these ancestral viruses with their hosts to give rise to the wide radiation among primate PVs.  Genomic diversity of mucosal MfPVs Alignments and comparisons of the L1 and E1 ORFs of these genital MfPVs (MfPV-3 to -11 and RhPV-1) indicate that they are most closely related to each other, sharing on average 77.7% (73.2 - 86.5%) and 76.8% (70.7 - 90.5%) nucleotide similarity across the L1 and E1 ORFs, respectively ( Supplement 4 ). Phylogenetic analyses classified these macaque PVs as a clade within the previously designated ?12 species ( Fig. 1 ). As a group, they share approximately 70.1% and 65.9% similarities within the respective L1 and E1 ORFs with their closest relatives, the ?9 (e.g., HPV16) and ?11 species (e.g., HPV34) ( de Villiers et al., 2004 ). Two chimpanzee PV subtypes, PtPV-1 and PpPV-1, are grouped within the ?10 species (e.g., HPV11 and HPV13), sharing approximately 87.4% (L1) and 90.1% (E1) similarities with HPV13, and approximately 66.9% (L1) and 64.0% (E1) similarities with members of the ?12 species. MfPV-1 was isolated from skin warts removed from the extremities of a cynomolgus macaque and shares 74.5% and 73.8% similarities with HPV-5, a member of the cutaneous beta-PV group, while on average only 60.8% and 57.5% similarities with the ?12 species MfPVs within the L1 and E1 ORFs, respectively. These findings support the idea that viral adaption to a host ecosystem (e.g., tissue tropism -- mucosal vs cutaneous) drives the phylogenetic positions of primate PVs more than host phylogeny, arguing against the strict application of virus-host co-evolution ( Hafner and Nadler, 1988 ).  Genomic diversity of mucosal MfPVs Alignments and comparisons of the L1 and E1 ORFs of these genital MfPVs (MfPV-3 to -11 and RhPV-1) indicate that they are most closely related to each other, sharing on average 77.7% (73.2 - 86.5%) and 76.8% (70.7 - 90.5%) nucleotide similarity across the L1 and E1 ORFs, respectively ( Supplement 4 ).

These findings support the idea that viral adaption to a host ecosystem (e.g., tissue tropism -- mucosal vs cutaneous) drives the phylogenetic positions of primate PVs more than host phylogeny, arguing against the strict application of virus-host co-evolution ( Hafner and Nadler, 1988 ).  Variants of MfPV-3 and RhPV-1 Variants of MfPV-3 and RhPV-1 isolated from different geographic regions (China vs Indonesia) were cloned and sequenced to determine variations across the genome ( Table 1 ). The virus isolated from sample Mac171 is 2.9% (L1) and 2.8% (E1) dissimilar with MfPV-3 prototype (sample Mac26), respectively; this variant represents another lineage of MfPV-3 and was named MfPV-3b. Two variants of RhPV-1, named RhPV-1b (isolates Mac170 and Mac686) share 99.8% (L1) and 99.6% (E1) similarities to each other, and 97.7% (L1) and 97.1% (E1) similarities with the RhPV-1 prototype, respectively. As shown in Figure 2 , variations can be determined across all of 8 ORFs, while indel (insertion and/or deletion) events only occur within the non-codon regions (NCR) including the URR (upstream regular region), NCR1 (region between E2 and E5 ORFs), and NCR2 (region between E5 and L2 ORFs). Among variants, the ratio of the number of non-synonymous changes to the number of synonymous changes per codon was >1 within the E4, E5, E6 and E7 ORFs for RhPV-1 and the E5 and E6 ORFs for MfPV-3, suggesting potential Darwinian selection within these ORFs. MfPV-3 and RhPV-1 variants are 3.8% dissimilar (both types) across the complete genomes. This is more variable than HPV16 European and non-European variants (2.3%), and HPV18 African and non-African variants (2.6%) ( Chen et al., 2009 ; Chen et al., 2005 ). Assuming similar evolutionary rates among alpha PVs, the variants of MfPVs diverged from their MRCAs longer ago than that of HPVs, suggesting an earlier origin of MfPVs (Chen et. al., manuscript in preparation).  Variants of MfPV-3 and RhPV-1 Variants of MfPV-3 and RhPV-1 isolated from different geographic regions (China vs Indonesia) were cloned and sequenced to determine variations across the genome ( Table 1 ).

Assuming similar evolutionary rates among alpha PVs, the variants of MfPVs diverged from their MRCAs longer ago than that of HPVs, suggesting an earlier origin of MfPVs (Chen et. al., manuscript in preparation).  Interspecies host infection of MfPVs The nucleotide sequences of the MY09/11 region within the L1 ORF of MfPV-3, -5, -8 and -11 share >90% similarities with PCR fragment sequences reported from a previous study ( Chan et al., 1997 ). This allowed us to classify MfPV-5 as a variant of MfPV-a (100% similarity), while MfPV-3 is a subtype of RhPV-d (93.9% similarity), MfPV-8 is a subtype of RhPV-a (94.6% similarity), and MfPV-11 is a subtype of RhPV-b (93.2% similarity) ( Table 1 ). We identified an overlapping set of PVs for MfPV-3, -8, -11 and RhPV-1 infecting both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques ( Chan et al., 1997 ). Interestingly, variants of MfPV-3, -8 and -11 isolated from different species of macaques (cynomolgus vs rhesus) showed variability consistent with “subtypes” ( Table 1 ). Accordingly, two chimpanzee PV subtypes, PtPV-1 and PpPV-1, sharing 93.2% similarity across the L1 nucleotide sequence, were also isolated from different species of chimpanzees (common and pygmy chimpanzees, respectively). This suggests that (non-human primate) alpha PVs might not be strictly species-specific and that “subtypes” may represent more recent divergence of host species or past interspecies infection ( Tosi, Morales, and Melnick, 2002 ). While areas of hydribization between cynomolgus and rhesus macaques have been described (in regions of Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand) ( Tosi, Morales, and Melnick, 2002 ), it should be noted that no species overlap exists in the area of Indonesia (Bogor) where all Indonesian animals surveyed in this study originated. However, RhPV-1 variants infecting cynomolgus and rhesus macaques appear to be an exception, with L1 dissimilarities less than 3%. Identification of additional RhPV-1 variants in rhesus macaques would help further address the questions of alpha PV genomic diversity and possible genetic factors involved in interspecies host infection.  Interspecies host infection of MfPVs The nucleotide sequences of the MY09/11 region within the L1 ORF of MfPV-3, -5, -8 and -11 share >90% similarities with PCR fragment sequences reported from a previous study ( Chan et al., 1997 ).
