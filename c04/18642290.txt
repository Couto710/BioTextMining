DNA copy number variation and loss of heterozygosity in relation to recurrence of and survival from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: a review Background Genetic aberrations, such as DNA copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), have been implicated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) initiation and progression. This review examines CNV and LOH as predictors of HNSCC recurrence and mortality. Methods We searched PubMed for relevant publications and compared and discussed results from the articles. Results Certain CNV and LOH events have consistently been associated with HNSCC recurrence and survival. The recent high-resolution SNP arrays have the potential to identify many more genetic changes and concurrent genome-wide CNV, copy-neutral and/or allelic imbalance LOH in HNSCC that may bear on prognosis. Conclusions Our review confrms that outcome in HNSCC can be predicted to a considerable extent by the presence of tumor cell genetic aberrations. It points out the limitations of some methodologies that were used in the past and discusses the advantages and challenges of using genome-wide SNP arrays.  Introduction World wide, head and neck cancers (oral cavity, nasopharynx, other pharynx, esophagus, larynx and thyroid) are the second most common malignancy (over 1.2 million new cases annually) and rank second (over 770,000 deaths) as a cause of cancer death 1 ; 2 . The major histological type for head and neck cancer is squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). About 40% of HNSCC cases arise in the oral cavity and oropharynx (oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)) 2 . In the US, patients with OSCC have a 5-year survival of 50–60% 3 . Those patients who survive often suffer disfigurement, loss of eating and speech function and poor quality of life 4 . Prediction of progression of HNSCC can have an important bearing on the aggressiveness of treatment of HNSCC. However, tumor characteristics such as anatomic site, thickness and grade are limited in their ability to predict prognosis and treatment response 5 . HNSCC likely results from cumulative epigenetic and genetic alterations 5 – 11 . Genetic alterations, including copy number variation (CNV – copy number gains or losses) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH – allelic imbalance or copy-neutral LOH), may result in inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes 8 ; 12 ; 13 , which in turn may lead to uncontrolled cell growth and metastasis 12 – 16 . Plausibly, the presence of CNV/LOH has the potential to serve as a prognostic indicator, alone or in combination with other markers, to identify HNSCC patients at high risk of recurrence and death. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge with regards to CNV and LOH as they are related to the prognosis of HNSCC.  Methods We searched PubMed for relevant publications and compared and discussed results from the articles.  Results Certain CNV and LOH events have consistently been associated with HNSCC recurrence and survival. The recent high-resolution SNP arrays have the potential to identify many more genetic changes and concurrent genome-wide CNV, copy-neutral and/or allelic imbalance LOH in HNSCC that may bear on prognosis.  Conclusions Our review confrms that outcome in HNSCC can be predicted to a considerable extent by the presence of tumor cell genetic aberrations. It points out the limitations of some methodologies that were used in the past and discusses the advantages and challenges of using genome-wide SNP arrays.  Methods For this review, we searched the PubMed using the following keys words from MeSH database: “Head and Neck Neoplasms”, “Gene Dosage”, “Gene Amplification”, “Loss of Heterozygosity”, “Prognosis”, “Neoplasm Recurrence, Local”. The main search term combinations included “Head and Neck Neoplasms”[Mesh] AND “Gene Dosage”[Mesh] AND “Prognosis”[Mesh]; “Head and Neck Neoplasms”[Mesh] AND “Gene Dosage”[Mesh] AND “Neoplasm Recurrence, Local”[Mesh]; “Head and Neck Neoplasms”[Mesh] AND “Loss of Heterozygosity”[Mesh] AND “Prognosis”[Mesh]; “Head and Neck Neoplasms”[Mesh] AND “Loss of Heterozygosity”[Mesh] AND “Neoplasm Recurrence, Local”[Mesh]; “Head and Neck Neoplasms”[Mesh] AND “Gene Amplification”[Mesh] AND “Prognosis”[Mesh]; “Head and Neck Neoplasms”[Mesh] AND “Gene Amplification”[Mesh] AND “Neoplasm Recurrence, Local”[Mesh]. We also applied search term combinations [“Head and Neck Neoplasms”[Mesh] and comparative genomic hybridization] and [“Head and Neck Neoplasms”[Mesh] and SNP arrays] to check whether there were any additional reports on genomic aberrations and survival/recurrence that used high throughput array methods.  Results We grouped the studies conducted over the past decades into two categories based on the methodologies used in each of the studies: low throughput/low resolution methods (fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-related methods) to study localized CNV/LOH occurrence; and high throughput/high resolution methods (array-related methods) to identify genome-wide CNV/LOH events. Tables 1 and 2 describe respectively the association between CNV/LOH and HNSCC survival by low throughput methods ( Table 1 ) and high throughput methods ( Table 2 ). Table 3 describes the association between CNV/LOH changes and HNSCC recurrence. When univariate Cox regression p-values are available, these p values are reported; if univariate Cox regression p-values are not available, the log rank test p-values are reported; if neither are available, the multivariate Cox regression p-values are reported. In Table 4 , the number of studies reporting associations between presence of CNV or LOH with survival and recurrence of HNSCC is summarized based on chromosomal arms. Localized CNV and LOH and survival Many studies have applied PCR-based methods and FISH to detect markers which could predict survival of head and neck cancer patients ( Table 1 ). Twelve studies that examined 11q13 found consistent amplification in this region 17 – 28 . Amplification of oncogene CCND1 18 – 20 ; 23 – 25 , EMS1 18 ; 22 , bcl-1 18 ; 25 , Int-2 21 ; 26 ; 27 , bcl-1/CCND1 25 and Int-2/hst- 1 co-amplification 17 located in this region were associated with shorter survival. It is possible that amplification of 11q13 plays an important role in head and neck cancer survival, given the many known oncogenes, such as bcl-1, Int-2, hst-1, EMS1, CCND1/PRAD1 , reside in this region 8 . An increase in the copy number at 3q26-27 29 , CCNL1 (3q25-q29) 30 , EGFR (7p12) 31 ; 32 , BTAK (20q13) and E2F1 (20q11) 33 ; increased c- MYC / CDKN2A (8q24.21/9p21) and CCND1 / CDKN2A (11q13/9p21) ratios 28 , combination of CCND1 amplification and p16 (CDKN2A , 9p21) deletion 23 , and loss of DIAI (22q13) 34 have also been shown to be associated with reduced head and neck cancer survival. Results from close to two dozen studies indicate that many of the LOH events on certain chromosomal regions are associated with shorter survival of HNSCC patients ( Table 1 ). All but one of these studies 35 compared paired tumor tissues and normal blood/tissues either from the same individual or from healthy controls. The regions with LOH changes that were associated with survival included 2q 36 , 3p 37 ; 38 , M6P/IGF2R (6q25-27) 39 , 8p23 40 ; 41 , 8p23-22 41 , 8p21.3-11.21 42 , 9p24.2-21.2 42 , p16 (9p21) 43 , 10q 44 , 13q 45 , 14q 46 , 18q 35 ; 47 . However, some studies reported that such an association was only seen if LOH changes were detected in more than one or two chromosomal regions or genes: in more than one of the 3p13, 3p24-26, 9p21 regions 48 ; 3p21 and/or 9p21 49 ; in more than two loci among 3p21, 3p26, 8p, 13q, 17p 50 ; p53 (17p13) and Rb (13q14) 51 ; or with fractional allelic loss (FAL) score > 0.4 48 . A report by Kim et al 8 indicated that 3p LOH was an early event during the carcinogenesis process. Our review shows that 3p LOH is also associated with survival among patients with HNSCC 49 ; 50 , OSCC 37 ; 48 or nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) 38 , suggesting 3p LOH may be involved in later stages of cancer progression as well. The biological importance of the genomic aberrations present in chromosomes 3 – 13, 16 – 18, 21 – 22 (particularly on chromosomes 3, 9, 11 and 17) and in potentially-affected oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes in OSCC or HNSCC have been nicely summarized by Scully et al 52 . While informative, there are some limitations to the above mentioned studies. The specimens from some of these studies were from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, which could have led to problems with DNA being fragmented or degraded 17 ; 20 ; 21 ; 23 ; 24 ; 27 ; 29 – 31 ; 36 ; 39 ; 41 ; 42 ; 47 ; 53 . Samples with mixed population of cells will have attenuated signals. Some of these studies used microdissection to collect purer cell populations to avoid signal contamination caused by bystander cell populations 25 ; 36 ; 37 ; 39 ; 41 ; 42 ; 47 ; 48 , while other studies did not try to isolate pure cell populations or to provide tumor content in the tissue examined 17 – 23 ; 26 ; 27 ; 29 – 31 ; 33 ; 49 – 51 . Only two studies did not provide information on how the samples were processed or information on tumor contents 35 ; 38 . Most of these studies focused on a few individual genes or microsatellite markers (range 1 to 55) located in quite limited regions of chromosomal arms or cytobands and were conducted by PCR-based methods, FISH, or Southern Blot methods that were not very sensitive 17 ; 18 ; 22 ; 29 ; 34 ; 48 . The pros and cons of various methods used to detect CNV and LOH have been summarized by Wreesmann et al 7 . In general, whole genome-based detection methods, such as comparative genome hybridization (CGH) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays will provide broader coverage of the chromosomal aberrations with more detailed profiling 7 ; 54 ; 55 . Genome-wide CNV and LOH and survival By using CGH, studies have identified some CNV and LOH that were associated with poor prognosis of HNSCC ( Table 2 ). In OSCC, 7p gains were associated with worse survival 56 . In HNSCC, poor prognosis was associated with gains at 2q12, 3q21-29, 3q25-27, 6p21.1, 8p11, 11q13, 12q24, 14q11, 14q23, 14q24, 14q31, 14q32, 15q24, 16q22, 17q23, 17q24, 17q25, 20q13, 22q13; losses at 1p21, 2q34, 5q11, 5q12, 5q14, 5q15, 5q31, 6q14, 6q15, 8p21-22, 10p12, 12q22, 18q11.2, 21p21, 21q11, 21q21, 21q22, 22q 57 – 59 ; and high level of gain at 11q13 (ratio > 2) 57 . In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gains at 5p15, 8q24-qter, 14q21, alone or all three together, predicted shorter survival 60 . Several of these studies had used fresh frozen tissue with tumor content higher than 70% 57 – 59 . One study used microdissected fresh frozen tumor tissues to increase their chances of obtaining high quality tumor DNA 60 . Gebhart et al 56 did not mention how they collected the samples or what the tumor contents were. Localized and genome-wide CNV and LOH and recurrence Tumor recurrence is another important indicator of patient prognosis. Using FISH and PCR-related methods, studies showed amplification at 3q26-27 29 ; amplification at 11q13 region 18 including EMS1 (22) , CCND1 24 ; 25 ; 61 ; 62 , amplification and/or rearrangement of bcl-1/CCND1 25 ; high polysomy and/or amplification at EGFR (7p12) 53 ; copy number of erbB-2 (17q21.1) > 1.2; of erbB- 3 (12q13) < 0.11 63 ; ratio of c-MYC (8q24.21)/ CDKN2A (9p21) >2 28 ; combination of CCND1 (11q13) amplification and CDKN2A ( p16 , 9p21) deletion 23 ; combination of CCND1 (11q13) amplification and p53 (17p13.1) LOH in stage IV patients 61 to be associated with higher risk of HNSCC/OSCC recurrence ( Table 3 ). Two of these studies applied microdissection to enhance collection of pure cell populations 25 ; 62 . Another two studies used tissues with tumor content higher than 70% 28 ; 53 . Other than a few studies that specified the use of fresh frozen tissue 18 ; 22 ; 25 ; 28 , most either did not mention how the tissues were processed 61 or what the tumor content was 22 – 24 ; 29 ; 61 . In HNSCC/OSCC, localized LOH changes associated with recurrence were found in the following regions: LOH ? 2 loci on 2q 64 , 3p 37 , 6p 65 , M6P/IGF2R (6q25-27) in patients who received radiotherapy 39 , 8p23 40 , 9p21 66 , INF? (9p22) 67 , 11q23 68 , 13q 65 , 3p21 and/or 9p21 49 ; LOH at p53 (17p13.1) and amplification at CCND1 (11q13) 61 ; LOH/microsatellite instabilities at p53 (17p13.1), INF? (9p22) within tumor margins 69 . A fractional allelic loss score of ? 0.4, based on 6 SNP markers and 13 microsatellite markers, was associated with OSCC local recurrence 48 . Using fresh frozen tissue with more than 70% tumor content, two CGH studies of HNSCC found the following genomic alterations to be associated with recurrence: gains at 1q32, 1q42-43, 2p24-25, 2q12, 3q21-29, 6p21.1, 6p22-24, 7p22, 11q13, 14q23, 14q24, 14q31, 14q32, 15q24, 16q22, 17q, 20q; losses at 8p21-22, 11q23-25, 18q11.2, 18q21, 19p, 22q; and high level of gains (ratio > 1.5) at 11q13 58 ; 59 . Compared to the low-throughput methods, these studies had a much improved resolution to detect genome-wide CNV and LOH events. However, CGH still has limited resolution (< 5 to 10Mb) 7 compared to a new set of SNP arrays with resolution of 15 – 90 kb 55 . Also, unlike the SNP array, CGH can not detect balanced chromosomal changes, such as copy-neutral LOH 55 ; 70 ; 70 . SNP arrays to detect genome-wide CNV and LOH Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were originally designed to assess associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms and disease risk. However, SNP arrays can also be used as efficient tools to detect CNV and LOH events in cancers by comparing information between tumor and normal reference DNA 55 ; 71 – 73 . To detect LOH, information on SNP genotype from paired tumor and normal DNA was compared to see whether heterozygous loci in the normal reference DNA samples turned into homozygous loci in the tumor DNA samples. To determine CNV, the hybridization signal intensities of corresponding SNP locus in the normal sample and in the tumor sample were compared 55 ; 71 . So far, there have only been a few studies using SNP arrays to detect CNV and LOH in HNSCC; use of the [“Head and Neck Neoplasms”[Mesh] AND SNP array] search term identified only seven papers, and none pertained to the evaluation of HNSCC prognosis. Tong et al 74 identified 6q LOH in OSCC by Affymetrix HuSNP arrays, a result that was confirmed by conventional microsatellite analysis. Zhou et al 72 examined a cell line model for OSCC progression using a 10K SNP array and suggested that CNV and/or LOH at 3pter-3p35.3, 3p14.1-3p13, 11p, 11q14.3-11q22.2, and 11q13.5-11q14.1 might be associated with OSCC progression. Zhou et al also observed concurrent CNV and LOH in region 1q22-24.1 and 1q42.13 in both pre-malignant and malignant cells, but not in normal cells 72 . Frequent allelic imbalances, including losses at 3p, 8p, 9p, and gains at 8q, 11q, and 20q, were detected in advanced stage OSCC samples with the use of 10K and 100K SNP arrays 75 . The 500K Affymetrix SNP array set with 2.5 kb median physical distance and 5.8 kb average distance between SNPs (> 85% of genome within 10 kb of a SNP) 76 ; 77 has been used to simultaneously detect LOH, overall copy number changes and allele-specific copy number changes with very high resolution in various cancers, but not yet in HNSCC 77 . By using a high resolution array such as the Affymetrix 500K SNP array set, researchers may discover genomic alterations that contribute to the various clinical phenotypes and varied disease survival. However, while this new technology holds great promise, it also presents some challenges. With the large numbers of genomic aberrations detected by the SNP arrays, concerns about data complexity, multiple-testing issues, and statistical power of the study need to be addressed. Based on existing cumulative knowledge, survival and recurrence in patients with HNSCC are associated with genomic alterations present in a number of chromosomal regions and genes ( Table 4 ). The most commonly reported CNV associated with survival pertain to chromosomal regions 11q (14 studies), 3q (4 studies), 7p and 22q (3 studies); LOH in 3p (5 studies), 8p and 9p (4 studies), 13q (3 studies). Most of these CNV studies focused on the examinations of specific genes that have been shown to play important roles in head and neck carcinogenesis, e.g. CCND1, EMS1, Int-2, bcl-1 at 11q13; CCNL1 at 3q; EGFR at 7p12; or BTAK or E2F1 at 22q. Most LOH studies tested various micro-satellite markers at certain regions to analyze the association between LOH changes and survival. As far as recurrence is concerned, the most commonly reported CNV/LOH associated with recurrence involved CNV at 11q (11 studies); LOH at 9p (4 studies) and 17p (3 studies). CNV/LOH at other chromosomal areas, as listed in Table 4 , has only been reported by one or two studies. Similar to studies with survival outcomes, these CNV studies with recurrence outcomes focused on some of the specific genes and LOH studies focused on using micro-satellite markers. There were only two papers that combined clinical characteristics, such as tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging or treatment conditions, with CNV or LOH to predict survival 37 ; 39 . Partridge et al found that 3p LOH was associated with poorer survival. The association was present even in patients with early stage I & II tumors 37 . Jamieson et al also showed that in patients who received radiotherapy (RT), 6q LOH was associated with reduced survival 39 . With the advent of SNP array technology and technologies to interrogate transcriptome and proteome, a better picture should emerge regarding the extent CNV/LOH might bear on HNSCC survival and recurrence, the specific CNV and/or LOH that might exert such an effect, and whether certain CNV and/or LOH, alone or in combination with other parameters, such as TNM staging, transcriptome profile, proteome profile, etc., can improve the prediction of HNSCC recurrence and mortality.  Results We grouped the studies conducted over the past decades into two categories based on the methodologies used in each of the studies: low throughput/low resolution methods (fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-related methods) to study localized CNV/LOH occurrence; and high throughput/high resolution methods (array-related methods) to identify genome-wide CNV/LOH events. Tables 1 and 2 describe respectively the association between CNV/LOH and HNSCC survival by low throughput methods ( Table 1 ) and high throughput methods ( Table 2 ). Table 3 describes the association between CNV/LOH changes and HNSCC recurrence. When univariate Cox regression p-values are available, these p values are reported; if univariate Cox regression p-values are not available, the log rank test p-values are reported; if neither are available, the multivariate Cox regression p-values are reported. In Table 4 , the number of studies reporting associations between presence of CNV or LOH with survival and recurrence of HNSCC is summarized based on chromosomal arms.

While informative, there are some limitations to the above mentioned studies. The specimens from some of these studies were from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, which could have led to problems with DNA being fragmented or degraded 17 ; 20 ; 21 ; 23 ; 24 ; 27 ; 29 – 31 ; 36 ; 39 ; 41 ; 42 ; 47 ; 53 .

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gains at 5p15, 8q24-qter, 14q21, alone or all three together, predicted shorter survival 60 .

Two of these studies applied microdissection to enhance collection of pure cell populations 25 ; 62 . Another two studies used tissues with tumor content higher than 70% 28 ; 53 . Other than a few studies that specified the use of fresh frozen tissue 18 ; 22 ; 25 ; 28 , most either did not mention how the tissues were processed 61 or what the tumor content was 22 – 24 ; 29 ; 61 . In HNSCC/OSCC, localized LOH changes associated with recurrence were found in the following regions: LOH ? 2 loci on 2q 64 , 3p 37 , 6p 65 , M6P/IGF2R (6q25-27) in patients who received radiotherapy 39 , 8p23 40 , 9p21 66 , INF? (9p22) 67 , 11q23 68 , 13q 65 , 3p21 and/or 9p21 49 ; LOH at p53 (17p13.1) and amplification at CCND1 (11q13) 61 ; LOH/microsatellite instabilities at p53 (17p13.1), INF? (9p22) within tumor margins 69 . A fractional allelic loss score of ? 0.4, based on 6 SNP markers and 13 microsatellite markers, was associated with OSCC local recurrence 48 . Using fresh frozen tissue with more than 70% tumor content, two CGH studies of HNSCC found the following genomic alterations to be associated with recurrence: gains at 1q32, 1q42-43, 2p24-25, 2q12, 3q21-29, 6p21.1, 6p22-24, 7p22, 11q13, 14q23, 14q24, 14q31, 14q32, 15q24, 16q22, 17q, 20q; losses at 8p21-22, 11q23-25, 18q11.2, 18q21, 19p, 22q; and high level of gains (ratio > 1.5) at 11q13 58 ; 59 . Compared to the low-throughput methods, these studies had a much improved resolution to detect genome-wide CNV and LOH events. However, CGH still has limited resolution (< 5 to 10Mb) 7 compared to a new set of SNP arrays with resolution of 15 – 90 kb 55 . Also, unlike the SNP array, CGH can not detect balanced chromosomal changes, such as copy-neutral LOH 55 ; 70 ; 70 . SNP arrays to detect genome-wide CNV and LOH Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were originally designed to assess associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms and disease risk. However, SNP arrays can also be used as efficient tools to detect CNV and LOH events in cancers by comparing information between tumor and normal reference DNA 55 ; 71 – 73 . To detect LOH, information on SNP genotype from paired tumor and normal DNA was compared to see whether heterozygous loci in the normal reference DNA samples turned into homozygous loci in the tumor DNA samples. To determine CNV, the hybridization signal intensities of corresponding SNP locus in the normal sample and in the tumor sample were compared 55 ; 71 . So far, there have only been a few studies using SNP arrays to detect CNV and LOH in HNSCC; use of the [“Head and Neck Neoplasms”[Mesh] AND SNP array] search term identified only seven papers, and none pertained to the evaluation of HNSCC prognosis. Tong et al 74 identified 6q LOH in OSCC by Affymetrix HuSNP arrays, a result that was confirmed by conventional microsatellite analysis. Zhou et al 72 examined a cell line model for OSCC progression using a 10K SNP array and suggested that CNV and/or LOH at 3pter-3p35.3, 3p14.1-3p13, 11p, 11q14.3-11q22.2, and 11q13.5-11q14.1 might be associated with OSCC progression. Zhou et al also observed concurrent CNV and LOH in region 1q22-24.1 and 1q42.13 in both pre-malignant and malignant cells, but not in normal cells 72 . Frequent allelic imbalances, including losses at 3p, 8p, 9p, and gains at 8q, 11q, and 20q, were detected in advanced stage OSCC samples with the use of 10K and 100K SNP arrays 75 . The 500K Affymetrix SNP array set with 2.5 kb median physical distance and 5.8 kb average distance between SNPs (> 85% of genome within 10 kb of a SNP) 76 ; 77 has been used to simultaneously detect LOH, overall copy number changes and allele-specific copy number changes with very high resolution in various cancers, but not yet in HNSCC 77 . By using a high resolution array such as the Affymetrix 500K SNP array set, researchers may discover genomic alterations that contribute to the various clinical phenotypes and varied disease survival. However, while this new technology holds great promise, it also presents some challenges. With the large numbers of genomic aberrations detected by the SNP arrays, concerns about data complexity, multiple-testing issues, and statistical power of the study need to be addressed. Based on existing cumulative knowledge, survival and recurrence in patients with HNSCC are associated with genomic alterations present in a number of chromosomal regions and genes ( Table 4 ). The most commonly reported CNV associated with survival pertain to chromosomal regions 11q (14 studies), 3q (4 studies), 7p and 22q (3 studies); LOH in 3p (5 studies), 8p and 9p (4 studies), 13q (3 studies). Most of these CNV studies focused on the examinations of specific genes that have been shown to play important roles in head and neck carcinogenesis, e.g. CCND1, EMS1, Int-2, bcl-1 at 11q13; CCNL1 at 3q; EGFR at 7p12; or BTAK or E2F1 at 22q. Most LOH studies tested various micro-satellite markers at certain regions to analyze the association between LOH changes and survival. As far as recurrence is concerned, the most commonly reported CNV/LOH associated with recurrence involved CNV at 11q (11 studies); LOH at 9p (4 studies) and 17p (3 studies). CNV/LOH at other chromosomal areas, as listed in Table 4 , has only been reported by one or two studies. Similar to studies with survival outcomes, these CNV studies with recurrence outcomes focused on some of the specific genes and LOH studies focused on using micro-satellite markers. There were only two papers that combined clinical characteristics, such as tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging or treatment conditions, with CNV or LOH to predict survival 37 ; 39 . Partridge et al found that 3p LOH was associated with poorer survival. The association was present even in patients with early stage I & II tumors 37 . Jamieson et al also showed that in patients who received radiotherapy (RT), 6q LOH was associated with reduced survival 39 . With the advent of SNP array technology and technologies to interrogate transcriptome and proteome, a better picture should emerge regarding the extent CNV/LOH might bear on HNSCC survival and recurrence, the specific CNV and/or LOH that might exert such an effect, and whether certain CNV and/or LOH, alone or in combination with other parameters, such as TNM staging, transcriptome profile, proteome profile, etc., can improve the prediction of HNSCC recurrence and mortality.  Localized CNV and LOH and survival Many studies have applied PCR-based methods and FISH to detect markers which could predict survival of head and neck cancer patients ( Table 1 ). Twelve studies that examined 11q13 found consistent amplification in this region 17 – 28 . Amplification of oncogene CCND1 18 – 20 ; 23 – 25 , EMS1 18 ; 22 , bcl-1 18 ; 25 , Int-2 21 ; 26 ; 27 , bcl-1/CCND1 25 and Int-2/hst- 1 co-amplification 17 located in this region were associated with shorter survival. It is possible that amplification of 11q13 plays an important role in head and neck cancer survival, given the many known oncogenes, such as bcl-1, Int-2, hst-1, EMS1, CCND1/PRAD1 , reside in this region 8 . An increase in the copy number at 3q26-27 29 , CCNL1 (3q25-q29) 30 , EGFR (7p12) 31 ; 32 , BTAK (20q13) and E2F1 (20q11) 33 ; increased c- MYC / CDKN2A (8q24.21/9p21) and CCND1 / CDKN2A (11q13/9p21) ratios 28 , combination of CCND1 amplification and p16 (CDKN2A , 9p21) deletion 23 , and loss of DIAI (22q13) 34 have also been shown to be associated with reduced head and neck cancer survival. Results from close to two dozen studies indicate that many of the LOH events on certain chromosomal regions are associated with shorter survival of HNSCC patients ( Table 1 ). All but one of these studies 35 compared paired tumor tissues and normal blood/tissues either from the same individual or from healthy controls. The regions with LOH changes that were associated with survival included 2q 36 , 3p 37 ; 38 , M6P/IGF2R (6q25-27) 39 , 8p23 40 ; 41 , 8p23-22 41 , 8p21.3-11.21 42 , 9p24.2-21.2 42 , p16 (9p21) 43 , 10q 44 , 13q 45 , 14q 46 , 18q 35 ; 47 . However, some studies reported that such an association was only seen if LOH changes were detected in more than one or two chromosomal regions or genes: in more than one of the 3p13, 3p24-26, 9p21 regions 48 ; 3p21 and/or 9p21 49 ; in more than two loci among 3p21, 3p26, 8p, 13q, 17p 50 ; p53 (17p13) and Rb (13q14) 51 ; or with fractional allelic loss (FAL) score > 0.4 48 . A report by Kim et al 8 indicated that 3p LOH was an early event during the carcinogenesis process. Our review shows that 3p LOH is also associated with survival among patients with HNSCC 49 ; 50 , OSCC 37 ; 48 or nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) 38 , suggesting 3p LOH may be involved in later stages of cancer progression as well. The biological importance of the genomic aberrations present in chromosomes 3 – 13, 16 – 18, 21 – 22 (particularly on chromosomes 3, 9, 11 and 17) and in potentially-affected oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes in OSCC or HNSCC have been nicely summarized by Scully et al 52 . While informative, there are some limitations to the above mentioned studies. The specimens from some of these studies were from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, which could have led to problems with DNA being fragmented or degraded 17 ; 20 ; 21 ; 23 ; 24 ; 27 ; 29 – 31 ; 36 ; 39 ; 41 ; 42 ; 47 ; 53 . Samples with mixed population of cells will have attenuated signals. Some of these studies used microdissection to collect purer cell populations to avoid signal contamination caused by bystander cell populations 25 ; 36 ; 37 ; 39 ; 41 ; 42 ; 47 ; 48 , while other studies did not try to isolate pure cell populations or to provide tumor content in the tissue examined 17 – 23 ; 26 ; 27 ; 29 – 31 ; 33 ; 49 – 51 . Only two studies did not provide information on how the samples were processed or information on tumor contents 35 ; 38 . Most of these studies focused on a few individual genes or microsatellite markers (range 1 to 55) located in quite limited regions of chromosomal arms or cytobands and were conducted by PCR-based methods, FISH, or Southern Blot methods that were not very sensitive 17 ; 18 ; 22 ; 29 ; 34 ; 48 . The pros and cons of various methods used to detect CNV and LOH have been summarized by Wreesmann et al 7 . In general, whole genome-based detection methods, such as comparative genome hybridization (CGH) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays will provide broader coverage of the chromosomal aberrations with more detailed profiling 7 ; 54 ; 55 .  Localized CNV and LOH and survival Many studies have applied PCR-based methods and FISH to detect markers which could predict survival of head and neck cancer patients ( Table 1 ).

Genome-wide CNV and LOH and survival By using CGH, studies have identified some CNV and LOH that were associated with poor prognosis of HNSCC ( Table 2 ). In OSCC, 7p gains were associated with worse survival 56 . In HNSCC, poor prognosis was associated with gains at 2q12, 3q21-29, 3q25-27, 6p21.1, 8p11, 11q13, 12q24, 14q11, 14q23, 14q24, 14q31, 14q32, 15q24, 16q22, 17q23, 17q24, 17q25, 20q13, 22q13; losses at 1p21, 2q34, 5q11, 5q12, 5q14, 5q15, 5q31, 6q14, 6q15, 8p21-22, 10p12, 12q22, 18q11.2, 21p21, 21q11, 21q21, 21q22, 22q 57 – 59 ; and high level of gain at 11q13 (ratio > 2) 57 . In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gains at 5p15, 8q24-qter, 14q21, alone or all three together, predicted shorter survival 60 . Several of these studies had used fresh frozen tissue with tumor content higher than 70% 57 – 59 . One study used microdissected fresh frozen tumor tissues to increase their chances of obtaining high quality tumor DNA 60 . Gebhart et al 56 did not mention how they collected the samples or what the tumor contents were.  Genome-wide CNV and LOH and survival By using CGH, studies have identified some CNV and LOH that were associated with poor prognosis of HNSCC ( Table 2 ). In OSCC, 7p gains were associated with worse survival 56 . In HNSCC, poor prognosis was associated with gains at 2q12, 3q21-29, 3q25-27, 6p21.1, 8p11, 11q13, 12q24, 14q11, 14q23, 14q24, 14q31, 14q32, 15q24, 16q22, 17q23, 17q24, 17q25, 20q13, 22q13; losses at 1p21, 2q34, 5q11, 5q12, 5q14, 5q15, 5q31, 6q14, 6q15, 8p21-22, 10p12, 12q22, 18q11.2, 21p21, 21q11, 21q21, 21q22, 22q 57 – 59 ; and high level of gain at 11q13 (ratio > 2) 57 .

Gebhart et al 56 did not mention how they collected the samples or what the tumor contents were.  Localized and genome-wide CNV and LOH and recurrence Tumor recurrence is another important indicator of patient prognosis. Using FISH and PCR-related methods, studies showed amplification at 3q26-27 29 ; amplification at 11q13 region 18 including EMS1 (22) , CCND1 24 ; 25 ; 61 ; 62 , amplification and/or rearrangement of bcl-1/CCND1 25 ; high polysomy and/or amplification at EGFR (7p12) 53 ; copy number of erbB-2 (17q21.1) > 1.2; of erbB- 3 (12q13) < 0.11 63 ; ratio of c-MYC (8q24.21)/ CDKN2A (9p21) >2 28 ; combination of CCND1 (11q13) amplification and CDKN2A ( p16 , 9p21) deletion 23 ; combination of CCND1 (11q13) amplification and p53 (17p13.1) LOH in stage IV patients 61 to be associated with higher risk of HNSCC/OSCC recurrence ( Table 3 ). Two of these studies applied microdissection to enhance collection of pure cell populations 25 ; 62 . Another two studies used tissues with tumor content higher than 70% 28 ; 53 . Other than a few studies that specified the use of fresh frozen tissue 18 ; 22 ; 25 ; 28 , most either did not mention how the tissues were processed 61 or what the tumor content was 22 – 24 ; 29 ; 61 . In HNSCC/OSCC, localized LOH changes associated with recurrence were found in the following regions: LOH ? 2 loci on 2q 64 , 3p 37 , 6p 65 , M6P/IGF2R (6q25-27) in patients who received radiotherapy 39 , 8p23 40 , 9p21 66 , INF? (9p22) 67 , 11q23 68 , 13q 65 , 3p21 and/or 9p21 49 ; LOH at p53 (17p13.1) and amplification at CCND1 (11q13) 61 ; LOH/microsatellite instabilities at p53 (17p13.1), INF? (9p22) within tumor margins 69 . A fractional allelic loss score of ? 0.4, based on 6 SNP markers and 13 microsatellite markers, was associated with OSCC local recurrence 48 . Using fresh frozen tissue with more than 70% tumor content, two CGH studies of HNSCC found the following genomic alterations to be associated with recurrence: gains at 1q32, 1q42-43, 2p24-25, 2q12, 3q21-29, 6p21.1, 6p22-24, 7p22, 11q13, 14q23, 14q24, 14q31, 14q32, 15q24, 16q22, 17q, 20q; losses at 8p21-22, 11q23-25, 18q11.2, 18q21, 19p, 22q; and high level of gains (ratio > 1.5) at 11q13 58 ; 59 .

Two of these studies applied microdissection to enhance collection of pure cell populations 25 ; 62 . Another two studies used tissues with tumor content higher than 70% 28 ; 53 . Other than a few studies that specified the use of fresh frozen tissue 18 ; 22 ; 25 ; 28 , most either did not mention how the tissues were processed 61 or what the tumor content was 22 – 24 ; 29 ; 61 . In HNSCC/OSCC, localized LOH changes associated with recurrence were found in the following regions: LOH ? 2 loci on 2q 64 , 3p 37 , 6p 65 , M6P/IGF2R (6q25-27) in patients who received radiotherapy 39 , 8p23 40 , 9p21 66 , INF? (9p22) 67 , 11q23 68 , 13q 65 , 3p21 and/or 9p21 49 ; LOH at p53 (17p13.1) and amplification at CCND1 (11q13) 61 ; LOH/microsatellite instabilities at p53 (17p13.1), INF? (9p22) within tumor margins 69 . A fractional allelic loss score of ? 0.4, based on 6 SNP markers and 13 microsatellite markers, was associated with OSCC local recurrence 48 . Using fresh frozen tissue with more than 70% tumor content, two CGH studies of HNSCC found the following genomic alterations to be associated with recurrence: gains at 1q32, 1q42-43, 2p24-25, 2q12, 3q21-29, 6p21.1, 6p22-24, 7p22, 11q13, 14q23, 14q24, 14q31, 14q32, 15q24, 16q22, 17q, 20q; losses at 8p21-22, 11q23-25, 18q11.2, 18q21, 19p, 22q; and high level of gains (ratio > 1.5) at 11q13 58 ; 59 . Compared to the low-throughput methods, these studies had a much improved resolution to detect genome-wide CNV and LOH events. However, CGH still has limited resolution (< 5 to 10Mb) 7 compared to a new set of SNP arrays with resolution of 15 – 90 kb 55 . Also, unlike the SNP array, CGH can not detect balanced chromosomal changes, such as copy-neutral LOH 55 ; 70 ; 70 .  SNP arrays to detect genome-wide CNV and LOH Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were originally designed to assess associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms and disease risk. However, SNP arrays can also be used as efficient tools to detect CNV and LOH events in cancers by comparing information between tumor and normal reference DNA 55 ; 71 – 73 . To detect LOH, information on SNP genotype from paired tumor and normal DNA was compared to see whether heterozygous loci in the normal reference DNA samples turned into homozygous loci in the tumor DNA samples. To determine CNV, the hybridization signal intensities of corresponding SNP locus in the normal sample and in the tumor sample were compared 55 ; 71 . So far, there have only been a few studies using SNP arrays to detect CNV and LOH in HNSCC; use of the [“Head and Neck Neoplasms”[Mesh] AND SNP array] search term identified only seven papers, and none pertained to the evaluation of HNSCC prognosis. Tong et al 74 identified 6q LOH in OSCC by Affymetrix HuSNP arrays, a result that was confirmed by conventional microsatellite analysis. Zhou et al 72 examined a cell line model for OSCC progression using a 10K SNP array and suggested that CNV and/or LOH at 3pter-3p35.3, 3p14.1-3p13, 11p, 11q14.3-11q22.2, and 11q13.5-11q14.1 might be associated with OSCC progression. Zhou et al also observed concurrent CNV and LOH in region 1q22-24.1 and 1q42.13 in both pre-malignant and malignant cells, but not in normal cells 72 . Frequent allelic imbalances, including losses at 3p, 8p, 9p, and gains at 8q, 11q, and 20q, were detected in advanced stage OSCC samples with the use of 10K and 100K SNP arrays 75 . The 500K Affymetrix SNP array set with 2.5 kb median physical distance and 5.8 kb average distance between SNPs (> 85% of genome within 10 kb of a SNP) 76 ; 77 has been used to simultaneously detect LOH, overall copy number changes and allele-specific copy number changes with very high resolution in various cancers, but not yet in HNSCC 77 . By using a high resolution array such as the Affymetrix 500K SNP array set, researchers may discover genomic alterations that contribute to the various clinical phenotypes and varied disease survival. However, while this new technology holds great promise, it also presents some challenges. With the large numbers of genomic aberrations detected by the SNP arrays, concerns about data complexity, multiple-testing issues, and statistical power of the study need to be addressed. Based on existing cumulative knowledge, survival and recurrence in patients with HNSCC are associated with genomic alterations present in a number of chromosomal regions and genes ( Table 4 ). The most commonly reported CNV associated with survival pertain to chromosomal regions 11q (14 studies), 3q (4 studies), 7p and 22q (3 studies); LOH in 3p (5 studies), 8p and 9p (4 studies), 13q (3 studies). Most of these CNV studies focused on the examinations of specific genes that have been shown to play important roles in head and neck carcinogenesis, e.g. CCND1, EMS1, Int-2, bcl-1 at 11q13; CCNL1 at 3q; EGFR at 7p12; or BTAK or E2F1 at 22q. Most LOH studies tested various micro-satellite markers at certain regions to analyze the association between LOH changes and survival. As far as recurrence is concerned, the most commonly reported CNV/LOH associated with recurrence involved CNV at 11q (11 studies); LOH at 9p (4 studies) and 17p (3 studies). CNV/LOH at other chromosomal areas, as listed in Table 4 , has only been reported by one or two studies. Similar to studies with survival outcomes, these CNV studies with recurrence outcomes focused on some of the specific genes and LOH studies focused on using micro-satellite markers. There were only two papers that combined clinical characteristics, such as tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging or treatment conditions, with CNV or LOH to predict survival 37 ; 39 . Partridge et al found that 3p LOH was associated with poorer survival. The association was present even in patients with early stage I & II tumors 37 . Jamieson et al also showed that in patients who received radiotherapy (RT), 6q LOH was associated with reduced survival 39 . With the advent of SNP array technology and technologies to interrogate transcriptome and proteome, a better picture should emerge regarding the extent CNV/LOH might bear on HNSCC survival and recurrence, the specific CNV and/or LOH that might exert such an effect, and whether certain CNV and/or LOH, alone or in combination with other parameters, such as TNM staging, transcriptome profile, proteome profile, etc., can improve the prediction of HNSCC recurrence and mortality.  SNP arrays to detect genome-wide CNV and LOH Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were originally designed to assess associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms and disease risk. However, SNP arrays can also be used as efficient tools to detect CNV and LOH events in cancers by comparing information between tumor and normal reference DNA 55 ; 71 – 73 . To detect LOH, information on SNP genotype from paired tumor and normal DNA was compared to see whether heterozygous loci in the normal reference DNA samples turned into homozygous loci in the tumor DNA samples. To determine CNV, the hybridization signal intensities of corresponding SNP locus in the normal sample and in the tumor sample were compared 55 ; 71 . So far, there have only been a few studies using SNP arrays to detect CNV and LOH in HNSCC; use of the [“Head and Neck Neoplasms”[Mesh] AND SNP array] search term identified only seven papers, and none pertained to the evaluation of HNSCC prognosis. Tong et al 74 identified 6q LOH in OSCC by Affymetrix HuSNP arrays, a result that was confirmed by conventional microsatellite analysis. Zhou et al 72 examined a cell line model for OSCC progression using a 10K SNP array and suggested that CNV and/or LOH at 3pter-3p35.3, 3p14.1-3p13, 11p, 11q14.3-11q22.2, and 11q13.5-11q14.1 might be associated with OSCC progression. Zhou et al also observed concurrent CNV and LOH in region 1q22-24.1 and 1q42.13 in both pre-malignant and malignant cells, but not in normal cells 72 . Frequent allelic imbalances, including losses at 3p, 8p, 9p, and gains at 8q, 11q, and 20q, were detected in advanced stage OSCC samples with the use of 10K and 100K SNP arrays 75 .

Conclusions Genomic markers, such as CNV and LOH, have been shown to be associated with disease-specific survival from and recurrence of HNSCC in a number of studies done by low throughput/lower resolution methods. However, most of these studies had some potential limitations, such as poor DNA quality or contaminated signals due to mixed cell populations present in the examined tumor samples. Also, these studies could detect either CNV or LOH, but not both, due to the limitations of their methodology. The current commercially-available SNP arrays have much improved resolution than the previously used methods and can be used to simultaneously detect CNV and LOH (allelic imbalance or copy number-neutral LOH). There have been no studies applying the high resolution SNP arrays, such as the Affymetrix 500K SNP set, to detect genomic aberrations in HNSCC or to predict HNSCC prognosis. While the SNP array approach provides an opportunity to identify potential genomic markers that could be used to better predict prognosis, there are also a number of challenges researchers need to overcome. These challenges pertain largely to the need for high quality DNA from high tumor content samples in large numbers of patients with HNSCC who have been monitored for tumor recurrence and survival.
