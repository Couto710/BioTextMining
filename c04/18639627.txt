Psychological stress exacerbates primary vaginal herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection by impairing both innate and adaptive immune responses Chronic psychological stress is generally immunosuppressive and contributes to an increase in herpes simplex virus (HSV) pathogenicity. We have previously shown that mice experiencing stress at the time of intranasal HSV infection have increased levels of infectious virus in their nasal cavity, as compared to control mice that were not subjected to stress. We have extended our studies to determine the effects of stress at another clinically-relevant mucosal site by examining the immune response to and pathogenesis of vaginal HSV infection. Mice experiencing psychological stress during vaginal HSV infection exhibited an increase in both vaginal viral titers and the pathology associated with this HSV infection. We demonstrate that these observations result from the failure of both the innate and HSV-specific adaptive immune responses. At two days post-infection, NK cell numbers were significantly decreased in mice experiencing restraint stress. Studies examining the adaptive immune response revealed a decrease in the number of HSV-specific CD8+ T cells in not only the vaginal tissue itself but also the draining iliac lymph nodes (ILN). Furthermore, the number of functional cells, in terms of both their degranulation and interferon-? production, in the ILN of stressed mice was decreased as compared to non-stressed mice. We conclude that psychological stress, through its suppression of both innate and adaptive immune responses, may be an important factor in the ability to control vaginal HSV infection.
