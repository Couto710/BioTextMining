Design and Synthesis of Small Molecule Glycerol 3-Phosphate Acyltransferase Inhibitors The incidence of obesity and other diseases associated with an increased triacylglycerol mass is growing rapidly, particularly in the United States. Glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of glycerolipid biosynthesis, the acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate with saturated long chain acyl-CoAs. In an effort to produce small molecule inhibitors of this enzyme, a series of benzoic and phosphonic acids was designed and synthesized. In vitro testing of this series has led to the identification of several compounds, in particular 2-(nonylsulfonamido)benzoic acid ( 15g ), possessing moderate GPAT inhibitory activity in an intact mitochondrial assay.  Introduction Obesity is currently estimated by the World Health Organization to affect at least 400 million adults worldwide. In the U.S. alone, approximately two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese. 1 Various diseases are associated with obesity, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and certain types of cancer. Even though there is a growing need for anti-obesity therapeutics, there are only two drugs approved for long-term use in the U.S. Orlistat functions by blocking the absorption of fat from the diet, 2 and sibutramine affects the central nervous system, reducing energy intake and increasing energy use. 3 Unfortunately, each of these drugs displays limited efficacy and produces undesirable side effects. Anti-obesity drugs currently in development utilize a wide variety of mechanisms, involving both central and peripheral targets. Alteration of lipid metabolism, by decreasing the de novo synthesis of triglycerides while increasing oxidation of stored fats, is a peripheral mechanism. This approach, based on weight loss effects observed with the compounds C75, 4 cerulenin, 5 and hGH(177-191), 6 may be highly valuable in developing anti-obesity drugs. The mitochondrial isoform of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-1 (mtGPAT) catalyzes the esterification of long chain acyl-CoAs with sn -glycerol-3-phosphate to produce lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). This reaction constitutes the first committed and rate-limiting step of glycerolipid biosynthesis. 7 , 8 The purported mechanism of this reaction is similar to that of a serine protease, with the primary hydroxyl group of glycerol-3-phosphate taking the place of serine in the catalytic triad. 9 Next, LPA is esterified further to produce phosphatidic acid, a precursor of various lipids including triacylglycerol (TAG), the main component of animal fat. In addition to obesity, high TAG levels in the bloodstream have been linked to several diseases, notably atherosclerosis and pancreatitis. 10 , 11 There are four known isoforms of GPAT, two microsomal isoforms located in the endoplasmic reticulum (GPAT3 and GPAT4), and two located in mitochondria (mtGPAT1 and mtGPAT2). 12 , 13 mtGPAT1 displays a strong preference for incorporating palmitoyl-CoA (16:0), thereby primarily producing saturated phospholipids, whereas the other three enzymes are not selective. 13 , 14 For recombinant mouse mtGPAT1, activity is 2-fold greater with palmitoyl-CoA than with various unsaturated chains 18 and 20 carbons in length, 15 and in rat liver, kidney, and heart, mtGPAT1 incorporates palmitoyl CoA 3-10 times more effectively than other long chain saturated or unsaturated acyl-CoAs. 14 , 16 - 18 Of the four isoforms, only mtGPAT1 is affected by changes in diet or exercise. When excess calories are available from a high-carbohydrate diet, mtGPAT1 mRNA expression increases, resulting in greater mtGPAT1 activity. 19 - 21 Mice that remain stationary for ten hours following a prolonged exercise regimen experience an increase in mtGPAT1 activity compared to mice that did not exercise at all, resulting in a significant overshoot of triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis. 22 mtGPAT1-deficient mice exhibit lower hepatic TAG levels and secrete less very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) than control mice. 23 In contrast, rat hepatocytes with 2.7-fold increased mtGPAT1 activity demonstrated a significant increase in de novo synthesis of diacylglycerol. 24 Overexpression of mtGPAT1 in vivo , as expected from the previous result, causes the levels of accumulated TAG and diacylglycerol (DAG) in mouse liver to rise dramatically to 12-fold and 7-fold that of normal levels. 25 In addition to producing a certain amount of TAG dependent on the amount of active enzyme present, mtGPAT1 activity is essential for controlling the partitioning of fatty-acyl CoAs to ?-oxidation or glycerolipid synthesis. Both mtGPAT1 and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of ?-oxidation, are located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. 26 This suggests that there is a competition between these enzymes for fatty acyl-CoA substrates. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) by phosphorylation, appears to acutely regulate both of these enzymes. Inactivation of ACC by AMPK prevents the buildup of malonyl-CoA, an allosteric suppressor of CPT-1, resulting in an increase in ?-oxidation. 27 AMPK inhibits mtGPAT1 as well, thereby decreasing the amount of TAG produced. 28 The relationship between these two processes has been demonstrated in vivo . Feeding mtGPAT1-knockout mice a high-fat, high-sugar diet to induce obesity resulted in an increase in oxidation as the long-chain acyl-CoA substrates were partitioned away from the TAG synthetic pathway toward CPT-1 and ?-oxidation. 29 mtGPAT1 overexpression in rat hepatocytes produced an 80% reduction in fatty acid oxidation coupled to an increase in phospholipid biosynthesis. 24 Overexpression in vivo resulted in a decrease in ?-oxidation as well. 25 The evidence suggesting that a drop in mtGPAT1 activity leads to a decrease in TAG levels as well as an increase in the amount of ?-oxidation suggests that inhibition of this enzyme with a small molecule could be an effective treatment for obesity, diabetes, and other health problems associated with increased TAG synthesis. As there are no such studies of small molecule mtGPAT1 inhibitors described in the literature, we set out to design, synthesize, and test a GPAT inhibitor as a potential weight loss strategy.  Chemistry The fundamental design of the compounds comprised structures with a negative charge at physiological pH to mimic the phosphate group of glycerol-3-phosphate and a long saturated chain to mimic the chain of palmitoyl-CoA, the substrate for which mtGPAT1 demonstrates a strong preference. 14 A sulfonamide linker was chosen to represent a stable mimic of the presumed intermediate or transition state of the acylation reaction catalyzed by GPAT ( Figure 1 ). The putative glycerol-3-phosphate binding pocket, as determined in GPAT isolated from squash chloroplasts, consists of several conserved positively charged amino acids, namely His-139, Lys-193, His-194, Arg-235, and Arg-237 in the squash enzyme. 9 This conserved pocket is believed to closely interact with the phosphate of glycerol-3-phosphate, and could play an integral role in binding a carboxylate or phosphonate in an inhibitor. The conserved catalytic histidine, which is thought to deprotonate the primary hydroxyl group involved in the acylation reaction, could interact favorably with the relatively acidic sulfonamide hydrogen ( Figure 1 ). Furthermore, the saturated chain of the alkyl sulfonamide would serve as a palmitoyl-CoA C16 mimic, ideally occupying the hydrophobic palmitoyl-CoA binding site extending from the glycerol-3-phosphate binding site in the classical view of a bisubstrate analog. The spatial relationship between the acyl-CoA and glycerol-3-phosphate in the mammalian GPAT active site is not known, however, so different linkers between the two moieties had to be examined. It was thought the most efficient way to do this would be to synthesize benzoic acids and phosphonic acids with saturated alkyl sulfonamides at each position on the aromatic ring. The distances between the sulfonamide and the carboxylate or phosphonate could also be altered by placing each group one or several methylene units from the ring. The most efficient synthetic pathway for the production of the benzoic acids was the coupling of a primary amine already present on a benzoic acid methyl ester to the alkyl sulfonyl chloride. Saponification of the ester to liberate the carboxylic acid was typically the final step in the synthetic sequence. In the case of the phosphonic acids, the phosphonates were installed through an Arbuzov reaction on a primary bromide or through aryl halide coupling reactions catalyzed by tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0). 30 The protected amine already present was then deprotected, coupled to the sulfonyl chloride, and the ethyl phosphonate was deprotected to yield the phosphonic acid. The compounds produced from these several routes allowed for the determination of a preliminary SAR from the GPAT inhibition assay. The first series of compounds was derived from the variously substituted methyl methylbenzoates ( Scheme 1 ). The meta - and para -amines were made by following a literature protocol. 31 Following radical bromination of the methyl group with NBS in CH3CN, the bromide was displaced by refluxing with NaN3 in EtOH. Under Staudinger conditions, the azide was reduced to the free amine 3 , which could then be coupled to 1-pentane- or 1-nonanesulfonyl chloride, prepared as described. 32 Finally, the methyl ester 4 was converted to the carboxylate product 5 by reaction with potassium t -butoxide in Et2O with water present. The ortho -substituted carboxylates required a different approach than the meta - and para - compounds ( Scheme 2 ). Indolinone 6 , formed in a reaction between the ortho -bromide and ammonia gas in MeOH, 33 was coupled to the alkane sulfonyl chlorides with NaH in DMF, and the resulting ?-lactam bond was readily cleaved with NaOH in THF/H2O to produce carboxylic acids 5e and 5f . The synthesis of the alkyl phosphonates 13a-f commenced with the protection of the starting toluidines as the bis-acylated aniline 8 ( Scheme 3 ). 34 Free-radical bromination with NBS in CH3CN afforded benzyl bromide 9 , which was converted to phosphonate 10 through Arbuzov reaction with triethyl phosphite. The aniline was unmasked by exposure to a refluxing acidic solution of EtOH. Following coupling of the amine with the alkane sulfonyl chloride to produce sulfonamide 12 , the phosphonic acid moiety was revealed by treatment with TMSBr in CH2Cl2 followed by methanolysis. Compounds 15a-i were synthesized by coupling the commercially available starting aniline with a variety of sulfonyl chlorides ( Scheme 4 ). The resulting sulfonamides 14a-i were then converted to the final products by hydrolysis with potassium t -butoxide and water in ether. Aromatic sulfonyl chlorides were used as well as the saturated C9 chain in an attempt to mimic the CoA portion of the acyl-CoA substrate, as opposed to the alkyl chain. Compounds 17a-f were designed to probe the effect of linkers of different length in the aryl sulfonamide portion of the molecule. These were produced in the same manner as 15a-i , starting with the commercially available aniline and coupling to either benzylsulfonyl chloride or phenylethylsulfonyl chloride with pyridine in methylene chloride to yield sulfonamides 16a-f ( Scheme 5 ). The methyl esters were then converted to the carboxylic acids 17a-f with potassium t -butoxide and water in ether. The synthesis of aryl phosphonic acids 21a-c is shown in Scheme 6 . Aryl bromide 18 underwent palladium-catalyzed aryl halide coupling with diethyl phosphite to install the phosphonate functionality. 30 The aniline was then deprotected by refluxing in acidic ethanol, and the free amine was coupled with commercially-available octanesulfonyl chloride to produce 20 . The final compound was then obtained by deprotecting the diethyl phosphonate with TMSBr. Compounds 24a-c , based on 15g , were designed as probes to examine the effect of installing different length alkylsulfonamides on the ortho -substituted analogs ( Scheme 7 ). It was believed that the compound with the saturated C16-chain ( 24c ) would exhibit significantly greater inhibitory activity than 15g , as the enzyme demonstrates a marked preference for palmitoyl-CoA over other long-chain acyl-CoAs. 14 Compounds 24d-f were designed to examine the role of an electronegative group at the 4-position of the benzene ring, which could possibly mimic the electron density of the secondary alcohol on glycerol-3-phosphate. All of these compounds ( 24a-f ) were produced with the same reaction sequence used to produce 15a-f and 17a-f .  Experimental Section General Methods 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker 300 or 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Melting points were determined on a Thomas-Hoover capillary melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel 60 (Merck, 230-400 mesh ASTM). All solvents used for reactions were distilled prior to use (Et2O and THF over Na/benzophenone, CH2Cl2 and CH3CN over CaH). High resolution mass spectra were obtained at the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were performed by Atlantic Microlab, Norcross, GA and were within 0.4% of calculated values.

Anal. (C15H22FNO4S) C, H, N. GPAT Assay The mtGPAT assay has been reported previously. 35 A mitochondrial preparation of glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase was added to the incubation mixture containing 14C-labeled glycerol 3-phosphate, palmitoyl-CoA, and varying inhibitor concentrations to initiate the reaction. After ten min, the reaction was terminated by adding chloroform, methanol, and 1% perchloric acid. Five min later, more chloroform and perchloric acid were added, and the upper aqueous layer was removed. After washing three times with 1% perchloric acid, the organic layer was evaporated under nitrogen, and the amount of 14C present was counted to determine the extent of reaction inhibition. Data points were recorded in triplicate, and IC50 values were calculated based on the amount of test inhibitor necessary to produce 50% of mtGPAT activity observed in the absence of inhibitor but in the presence of DMSO vehicle control.  General Methods 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker 300 or 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Melting points were determined on a Thomas-Hoover capillary melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel 60 (Merck, 230-400 mesh ASTM). All solvents used for reactions were distilled prior to use (Et2O and THF over Na/benzophenone, CH2Cl2 and CH3CN over CaH). High resolution mass spectra were obtained at the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were performed by Atlantic Microlab, Norcross, GA and were within 0.4% of calculated values.  General Procedure for 4a-d To a stirring solution of the appropriate amine 3a-c (1.2 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (4 mL) at 0 °C, the sulfonyl chloride (1.3 mmol) was added dropwise, followed by Et3N (1.3 mmol). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature, where it was stirred for 2-3 h. Saturated NH4Cl solution was added to quench the reaction, and the mixture was extracted with 3 × 10 mL CH2Cl2. The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4, concentrated in vacuo , and the products were purified by flash chromatography (20% EtOAc in hexanes).

GPAT Assay The mtGPAT assay has been reported previously. 35 A mitochondrial preparation of glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase was added to the incubation mixture containing 14C-labeled glycerol 3-phosphate, palmitoyl-CoA, and varying inhibitor concentrations to initiate the reaction. After ten min, the reaction was terminated by adding chloroform, methanol, and 1% perchloric acid. Five min later, more chloroform and perchloric acid were added, and the upper aqueous layer was removed. After washing three times with 1% perchloric acid, the organic layer was evaporated under nitrogen, and the amount of 14C present was counted to determine the extent of reaction inhibition. Data points were recorded in triplicate, and IC50 values were calculated based on the amount of test inhibitor necessary to produce 50% of mtGPAT activity observed in the absence of inhibitor but in the presence of DMSO vehicle control.  Supplementary Material 1_si_001  Results and Discussion All benzoic acids and phosphonic acids produced were then evaluated for their ability to inhibit the acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate in vitro . The acylation reaction between 14C-labelled glycerol-3-phosphate and palmitoyl-CoA, initiated by adding mtGPAT, was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of the inhibitor by scintillation counting. 35 Each reaction was performed in triplicate, and the IC50 values were then calculated based on the amount of inhibitor needed to produce 50% inhibition compared to the DMSO vehicle control. Results are summarized in Tables 1 - 3 . Data obtained from benzoic acids 5a-f indicate that in all cases, regardless of the position of the carboxylate with respect to the sulfonamide, the longer C9 alkyl chain resulted in greater inhibition than the C5 saturated chain. The most effective orientation between the acid and sulfonamide appeared to be ortho -substitution, as 5f (IC50 = 66.5 ?M) is a better inhibitor than either 5b (IC50 = 129 ?M) or 5d (IC50 = 83.5 ?M). The assay data from phosphonic acids 13a-f also indicated that the longer C9 alkyl chain is more effective. In this series of compounds, however, there is no significant difference in activity between the different orientations of the phosphonic acid and the alkyl sulfonamide moiety. The most active compound of this class was 13d (IC50 = 62.8 ?M), the meta -substituted phosphonic acid, though not by much over 13b (IC50 = 81.3 ?M) and 13f (IC50 = 81.1 ?M). Compounds 15b, 15c, 15e, 15f, 15h, 15i and 17a-f were designed to examine the possibility of an appropriately-substituted benzene ring serving as a mimic for the Coenzyme A portion of the fatty acyl-CoA natural substrate. The distance between the benzene ring and the sulfonamide sulfur does not appear to have a significant effect on the inhibitory activity of these compounds, as there is effectively no difference between one methylene and two methylene linkers. It is apparent, however, that the ortho -substituted compounds containing these linker methylenes ( 17e-f ) are slightly more effective than the other substituted benzoic acids ( 17a-d ). For the meta - and para -compounds, inhibitory activity is greater when the benzene ring is directly attached to the sulfur, although the ortho -compounds are all similar. The addition of a para -chloride on the benzene ring does lead to increases in activity for the para - ( 15c ), meta - ( 15f ), and ortho -compounds ( 15i ). Compounds 15a , 15d , and 15g were easily obtainable targets, which allowed for examination of the effect of the methylene linker between the benzene ring and the sulfonamide in 5a-f . For every substitution, these compounds were the most effective GPAT inhibitors, with the ortho -compound ( 15g) demonstrating the greatest activity (IC50 = 24.7 ?M). Based on these results, the long alkyl chain is likely a more effective fatty-acyl CoA recognition element for the enzyme than a simple benzene ring. In view of the increased inhibitory activity of 15g , two other compound series were prepared. The first, 21a-c , probes the effectiveness of an aryl phosphonic acid in place of the benzoic acid moiety. In vitro , the ortho -substituted acid ( 21c ) is less active than 15g , and substitution of the phosphonic acid moiety does not appear to significantly affect activity ( Table 3 ). The other compounds produced ( 24a-f ) indicate the importance of chain length of the alkyl sulfonamide, as well as the effect of adding heteroatoms para - to the sulfonamide. It appears that the longer chain is very important to the activity of these compounds, as a C1-chain ( 24a ) results in significantly less in vitro activity than the C9 chain. Compounds 24b and 24c were produced to determine if the naturally-favored C16 chain is preferred in these compounds over other chain lengths, including the C14 chain. In this case, there is no observed preference for the C16 compound over other long chains, in contrast to that observed with the natural acyl-CoA substrates. 14  Results and Discussion All benzoic acids and phosphonic acids produced were then evaluated for their ability to inhibit the acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate in vitro . The acylation reaction between 14C-labelled glycerol-3-phosphate and palmitoyl-CoA, initiated by adding mtGPAT, was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of the inhibitor by scintillation counting. 35 Each reaction was performed in triplicate, and the IC50 values were then calculated based on the amount of inhibitor needed to produce 50% inhibition compared to the DMSO vehicle control. Results are summarized in Tables 1 - 3 . Data obtained from benzoic acids 5a-f indicate that in all cases, regardless of the position of the carboxylate with respect to the sulfonamide, the longer C9 alkyl chain resulted in greater inhibition than the C5 saturated chain. The most effective orientation between the acid and sulfonamide appeared to be ortho -substitution, as 5f (IC50 = 66.5 ?M) is a better inhibitor than either 5b (IC50 = 129 ?M) or 5d (IC50 = 83.5 ?M). The assay data from phosphonic acids 13a-f also indicated that the longer C9 alkyl chain is more effective. In this series of compounds, however, there is no significant difference in activity between the different orientations of the phosphonic acid and the alkyl sulfonamide moiety. The most active compound of this class was 13d (IC50 = 62.8 ?M), the meta -substituted phosphonic acid, though not by much over 13b (IC50 = 81.3 ?M) and 13f (IC50 = 81.1 ?M). Compounds 15b, 15c, 15e, 15f, 15h, 15i and 17a-f were designed to examine the possibility of an appropriately-substituted benzene ring serving as a mimic for the Coenzyme A portion of the fatty acyl-CoA natural substrate. The distance between the benzene ring and the sulfonamide sulfur does not appear to have a significant effect on the inhibitory activity of these compounds, as there is effectively no difference between one methylene and two methylene linkers. It is apparent, however, that the ortho -substituted compounds containing these linker methylenes ( 17e-f ) are slightly more effective than the other substituted benzoic acids ( 17a-d ). For the meta - and para -compounds, inhibitory activity is greater when the benzene ring is directly attached to the sulfur, although the ortho -compounds are all similar. The addition of a para -chloride on the benzene ring does lead to increases in activity for the para - ( 15c ), meta - ( 15f ), and ortho -compounds ( 15i ). Compounds 15a , 15d , and 15g were easily obtainable targets, which allowed for examination of the effect of the methylene linker between the benzene ring and the sulfonamide in 5a-f . For every substitution, these compounds were the most effective GPAT inhibitors, with the ortho -compound ( 15g) demonstrating the greatest activity (IC50 = 24.7 ?M). Based on these results, the long alkyl chain is likely a more effective fatty-acyl CoA recognition element for the enzyme than a simple benzene ring. In view of the increased inhibitory activity of 15g , two other compound series were prepared. The first, 21a-c , probes the effectiveness of an aryl phosphonic acid in place of the benzoic acid moiety. In vitro , the ortho -substituted acid ( 21c ) is less active than 15g , and substitution of the phosphonic acid moiety does not appear to significantly affect activity ( Table 3 ). The other compounds produced ( 24a-f ) indicate the importance of chain length of the alkyl sulfonamide, as well as the effect of adding heteroatoms para - to the sulfonamide. It appears that the longer chain is very important to the activity of these compounds, as a C1-chain ( 24a ) results in significantly less in vitro activity than the C9 chain. Compounds 24b and 24c were produced to determine if the naturally-favored C16 chain is preferred in these compounds over other chain lengths, including the C14 chain. In this case, there is no observed preference for the C16 compound over other long chains, in contrast to that observed with the natural acyl-CoA substrates. 14  Conclusions The first preliminary structure-activity relationship of mammalian GPAT inhibition has been constructed, utilizing in vitro assay data from several simple sulfonamide-containing benzoic acids and phosphonic acids. It appears that a medium to long chain alkyl sulfonamide is necessary for inhibitory activity, but there is not a significant preference for the naturally-favored palmitoyl chain (C16) over other shorter saturated chains. Replacement of the benzoic acid of 15g with an aryl phosphonic acid moiety results in decreased inhibitory activity, as does the presence of chloride, fluoride, or a hydroxyl group at the 5-position of the benzene ring. The best inhibitor obtained from this study, which possesses modest inhibitory activity in vitro , has been evaluated in relevant biological systems, with the results to be reported in the near future.
