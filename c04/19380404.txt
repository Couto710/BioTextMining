Radiopharmaceuticals in Preclinical and Clinical Development for Monitoring of Therapy with PET This review article discusses PET agents, other than 18F-FDG, with the potential to monitor the response to therapy before, during, or after therapeutic intervention. This review deals primarily with non–18F-FDG PET tracers that are in the final stages of preclinical development or in the early stages of clinical application for monitoring the therapeutic response. Four sections related to the nature of the tracers are included: radiotracers of DNA synthesis, such as the 2 most promising agents, the thymidine analogs 3?-18F-fluoro-3?-deoxythymidine and 18F-1-(2?-deoxy-2?-fluoro-?- d -arabinofuranosyl)thymine; agents for PET imaging of hypoxia within tumors, such as 60/62/64Cu-labeled diacetyl-bis( N 4-methylthiosemicarbazone) and 18F-fluoromisonidazole; amino acids for PET imaging, including the most popular such agent, l -[methyl-11C]methionine; and agents for the imaging of tumor expression of androgen and estrogen receptors, such as 16?-18F-fluoro-5?-dihydrotestosterone and 16?-18F-fluoro-17?-estradiol, respectively.  Conclusion This article has discussed progress in clinical PET research with new PET tracers for evaluating the tumor response at the level of biomolecular therapeutic targets and examining therapeutically relevant phenotypes of cellular biology and the tumor tissue microenvironment. Building on the success of 18F-FDG PET and a worldwide PET infrastructure, both firmly established and continually growing, a revolution is occurring in the detection of the tumor response to therapy. In the coming decade, cancer care specialists can look forward to a wave of noninvasive molecular probes other than 18F-FDG for predicting and characterizing the tumor response to therapy in new ways that are more specific to the therapeutic regimens used. These clinical PET tools should improve therapeutic planning and response assessment and should lead to improved patient outcomes.  Figures and Table FIGURE 1 (A) 18F-FLT. (B) 18F-FMAU.

FIGURE 5 (A) Transaxial CT (top left) and 18F-FDG PET (top right) images of pelvis show intense 18F-FDG uptake within known cervical tumor at site of cervical mass seen on CT. Transaxial 30- to 60-min summed images of 60Cu-ATSM PET (bottom left) and 64Cu-ATSM PET (bottom right) of pelvis at same level demonstrate mildly increased uptake within known primary cervical tumor. There are similar patterns of 60Cu-ATSM and 64Cu-ATSM uptake within tumor. (B) Transaxial coregistered 18F-FDG PET/CT (top left) and 18F-FDG PET (top right) images of pelvis show intense 18F-FDG uptake within known cervical tumor at site of cervical mass seen on CT. Transaxial 30- to 60-min summed images of 60Cu-ATSM PET (bottom left) and 64Cu-ATSM PET (bottom right) of pelvis at same level demonstrate markedly increased uptake within known primary cervical tumor. There are similar patterns of 60Cu-ATSM and 64Cu-ATSM uptake within tumor. (Reprinted with permission of ( 86 ).)

(A) MRI (gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image [T1Gd]) shows large, contrast-enhancing, irregular ring-shaped tumor with necrotic center. Non–contrast-enhanced volume was 20 cm3, T1Gd volume was 80 cm3, and T2-weighted volume was 167 cm3. (B) 18F-FMISO image through same plane. HV was 129 cm3, and T/Bmax ratio was 3.0.

Non–contrast-enhanced volume was 1 cm3, T1Gd volume was 7 cm3, and T2-weighted volume was 37 cm3. (D) 18F-FMISO image through same plane. HV was 5.3 cm3, and T/Bmax ratio was 1.6.

(B) 11C-MET PET image showed obvious accumulation of tracer corresponding to abnormality on MR image. Mean lesion-to-normal tissue ratio was 1.70.
