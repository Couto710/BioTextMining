A Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies A New Ovarian Cancer Susceptibility Locus On 9p22.2 Epithelial ovarian cancer has a major heritable component, but the known susceptibility genes explain less than half the excess familial risk 1 . We performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) to identify common ovarian cancer susceptibility alleles. We evaluated 507,094 SNPs genotyped in 1,817 cases and 2,353 controls from the UK and ~2 million imputed SNPs. We genotyped the 22,790 top ranked SNPs in 4,274 cases and 4,809 controls of European ancestry from Europe, USA and Australia. We identified 12 SNPs at 9p22 associated with disease risk (P<10?8). The most significant SNP (rs3814113; P = 2.5 × 10?17) was genotyped in a further 2,670 ovarian cancer cases and 4,668 controls confirming its association (combined data odds ratio = 0.82 95% CI 0.79 – 0.86, P-trend = 5.1 × 10?19). The association differs by histological subtype, being strongest for serous ovarian cancers (OR 0.77 95% CI 0.73 – 0.81, Ptrend = 4.1 × 10?21).  METHODS Study design The ovarian cancer case-control studies that participated in stages 1, 2 and 3 are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 online. Stage 1 comprised invasive epithelial ovarian cancer cases from UK and genotype data of UK controls from GWAS of other phenotypes. Stage 2 comprised 10 studies from the OCAC. Stage 3 comprised 10 additional studies from the OCAC. For all studies we have data on disease status, age at diagnosis and date of blood draw, self-reported ethnic group and histological subtype. All but 5 studies provided information of reported first-degree family history of ovarian cancer. Genotyping Genotyping for stage 1 cases was conducted using the Illumina Infinium 610K array at Illumina Corporation. Existing data from two sets of controls, genotyped on the Infinium 550k array, were used in stage 1 analyses: the Welcome Trust Case-Control Consortium 1958 birth cohort 14 , and a national colorectal control study 36 using Illumina platform Hap550 array. All cases were from the UK and confirmed as invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. Quality control criteria were applied separately to the cases and each control sets because they were genotyped separately. SNPs were excluded if (1) they deviated from hardy-Weinberg equilibiurm (HWE) at P < 10?4 or (2) had a MAF < 1%, or (3) MAF was between 1% and 5% and call rate < 99% or (4) MAF > 5% and call rate < 95%. We also rejected SNPs if a test for trend by genotype between the two control sets was significant at P < 10?4. This led to 33,479 SNPs being excluded and 507,094 SNPs passing QC. Genotyping the 10 studies in stage 2 was conducted using an Illumina iSelect array at Illumina Corportation. We excluded SNPs (n=1,635) for the stage 2 data if the sum of the test statistics for deviation from HWE for the 10 studies was significant at p < 10?5 or if the SNPs had a call rate of <95% or if the MAF < 0.5%. A total of 21,955 SNPs were available for data analysis in stage 2. We utilized only samples with called genotypes on at least 80% of SNPs. Seventy-three samples were excluded from Stage 1 and 273 from Stage 2. Nineteen samples were included as duplicates in stage 1 and genotype concordance rate for these pairs was 99.99%. One hundred and twenty-two samples were included as duplicates in stage 2 and duplicate concordance rate was 99.99%. Six studies in stage 3 were genotyped for rs3814113 by Taqman using ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system at each laboratory. For three studies (TOR, NCO, MAY) genotype data were available from an independent, ongoing GWAS study that is also used the Illumina Infinium 610K platform. Genotyping and QC was performed at Mayo Clinic genotyping shared resources. For Taqman genotyping quality control, we compared genotype call rates and concordance by study and overall. We used the following criteria as a measure of acceptable genotyping: (1) > 3% sample duplicates included; (2) concordance rate for the duplicates ? 98%; (3) overall call rate (by study) > 95%; (4) call rates > 90% for each individual 384-well plate and (5) no deviation from HWE in controls (P>=0.05). Genotyping consistency across laboratories using Taqman was also evaluated by genotyping a common panel of CEPH-Utah trios including 90 individual DNA samples, 5 duplicate samples and 1 negative control ( http://ccr.coriell.org/ ). The concordance of genotyping results between the centres was required to be greater than 98% in order for the genotype data to be included. The genotyping results from all studies in the stage 3 met the above criteria and were included in the final analysis. Statistics Population stratification For the stage 1 samples, we used the program LAMP 37 to assign intercontinental ancestry based on the Hapmap (release #22) genotype frequency data for European, African and Asian populations. Samples with less than 90% European ancestry were excluded from the analysis (n=73). For the stage 2 data, 800 SNPs that are known to be predictive of ancestry (“Ancestry Informative Markers”) (AIMs) were genotyped. We again used LAMP and the Hapmap data (release #23) on European (CEU), African American (ASW), East Asian (JPT-CHB-CHD), Mexican (MEX) and Indian (GIH) populations to estimate ancestry. Subjects with less than 90 percent European ancestry were excluded from the main analyses (n= 987). We then used the AIMs to calculate principal components for the subjects of European ancestry. The first principal component explained 0.42 percent of the variability and was included as a covariate in subsequent association analyses. Subsequent principal components were not included as they and explained less variability and there was little difference in their Eigenvalues. Imputation We imputed missing genotype data for all the common variants in the Hapmap data for two reasons. Firstly the stage 1 cases and controls were genotyped using slightly different SNP sets and different SNPs may have failed QA in different sample sets. Secondly, imputing SNPs that have not been genotyped increases genome coverage and may improve power. We used an in-house method that combines the features of fastPHASE 38 and IMPUTE 39 to impute the ungenotyped or missing SNPs, utilising the phase2 Hapmap data (CEU) which contains phased haplotypes for 60 individuals on 2.5 million SNPs. For each imputed genotype the expected number of minor alleles carried was estimated (weights). Genotyped SNPs were assigned weights of 0, 1 or 2 (actual number of minor alleles carried). We estimated the accuracy of imputation by calculating the estimated r 2 between the imputed and actual SNP 40 . SNPs with r2<0.64 were excluded (n = 152,401) leaving a total of 2,563,972 SNPs for stage 1 analysis. Statistical Tests of Association We used logistic regression to test for association between genotype and case -control status using the imputed weights and the ethnicity estimates as covariates. SNPs were selected for replication in Stage 2 based on the weighted ranked test statistics from the Stage 1 analysis. The weights were based on whether the SNP was genotyped or imputed (Igenotype = 1 if genotyped” 0 otherwise), the accuracy of imputation ( r 2 ), the association statistic (T) and the design score (s) using somewhat arbitrary formula ((1+0.1Igenotype)*T*r2+2s). SNPs that were correlated with a higher ranked SNP with r2>0.8 were excluded except for those correlated with the 1000 highest ranked SNPs. Using this method we took forward 22,790 SNPs as candidates for association of which 5,380 were purely imputed (not-genotyped). For the stage 2 analysis, we tested for association by performing logistic regression using the imputed values from stage 1, combined with the genotyping results for stage 2. We corrected for the first principal component and the ethnicity estimates in the second stage analysis (all subjects in the first stage were selected to be European) and stratified by study using a Wald test. We corrected for ethnicity in stage 3 using self reported ethnicity and stratified by study. A subgroup analysis was used to compare genotype-specific risks by disease subgroup with controls. The effect of age group, family history and population of origin (European and non-European) was assessed similarly. Modification by these sub-groups was tested by fitting a SNP by subgroup interaction term in a logistic regression model.

Imputation We imputed missing genotype data for all the common variants in the Hapmap data for two reasons. Firstly the stage 1 cases and controls were genotyped using slightly different SNP sets and different SNPs may have failed QA in different sample sets. Secondly, imputing SNPs that have not been genotyped increases genome coverage and may improve power. We used an in-house method that combines the features of fastPHASE 38 and IMPUTE 39 to impute the ungenotyped or missing SNPs, utilising the phase2 Hapmap data (CEU) which contains phased haplotypes for 60 individuals on 2.5 million SNPs. For each imputed genotype the expected number of minor alleles carried was estimated (weights). Genotyped SNPs were assigned weights of 0, 1 or 2 (actual number of minor alleles carried). We estimated the accuracy of imputation by calculating the estimated r 2 between the imputed and actual SNP 40 . SNPs with r2<0.64 were excluded (n = 152,401) leaving a total of 2,563,972 SNPs for stage 1 analysis.

Statistical Tests of Association We used logistic regression to test for association between genotype and case -control status using the imputed weights and the ethnicity estimates as covariates. SNPs were selected for replication in Stage 2 based on the weighted ranked test statistics from the Stage 1 analysis. The weights were based on whether the SNP was genotyped or imputed (Igenotype = 1 if genotyped” 0 otherwise), the accuracy of imputation ( r 2 ), the association statistic (T) and the design score (s) using somewhat arbitrary formula ((1+0.1Igenotype)*T*r2+2s). SNPs that were correlated with a higher ranked SNP with r2>0.8 were excluded except for those correlated with the 1000 highest ranked SNPs. Using this method we took forward 22,790 SNPs as candidates for association of which 5,380 were purely imputed (not-genotyped). For the stage 2 analysis, we tested for association by performing logistic regression using the imputed values from stage 1, combined with the genotyping results for stage 2. We corrected for the first principal component and the ethnicity estimates in the second stage analysis (all subjects in the first stage were selected to be European) and stratified by study using a Wald test. We corrected for ethnicity in stage 3 using self reported ethnicity and stratified by study. A subgroup analysis was used to compare genotype-specific risks by disease subgroup with controls. The effect of age group, family history and population of origin (European and non-European) was assessed similarly. Modification by these sub-groups was tested by fitting a SNP by subgroup interaction term in a logistic regression model.
