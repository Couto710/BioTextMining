Amyloid ?-Protein Dimers Isolated Directly from Alzheimer Brains Impair Synaptic Plasticity and Memory Alzheimer’s disease (AD) constitutes a rising threat to public health. Despite extensive research in cellular and animal models, identifying the pathogenic agent present in the human brain and showing that it confers key features of AD have not been achieved. We extracted soluble amyloid ?–protein (A?) oligomers directly from the cerebral cortex of typical AD subjects. The oligomers potently inhibited long term potentiation (LTP), enhanced long term depression (LTD), and reduced dendritic spine density in normal rodent hippocampus. Soluble A? from AD brain also disrupted the memory of a learned behavior in normal rats. These various effects were specifically attributable to A? dimers. Mechanistically, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) were required for LTD enhancement and NMDA receptors (NMDAR) for spine loss. Co-administering antibodies to the A? N-terminus prevented the LTP and LTD deficits, whereas antibodies to the mid-region or C-terminus were less effective. Insoluble amyloid plaque cores from AD cortex did not impair LTP unless they were first solubilized to release A? dimers, suggesting that plaque cores are largely inactive but sequester A? dimers that are synaptotoxic. We conclude that soluble A? oligomers extracted from AD brains potently impair synapse structure and function and that dimers are the smallest synaptotoxic species.  METHODS Human brain sample preparation Brain specimens from deceased human subjects were collected at autopsy following informed consent from the next of kin under protocols approved by the Partners Human Research Committee at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the ERC/IRB committee at Beaumont Hospital in Dublin, Ireland. Each subject’s clinical and neuropathological diagnoses are provided in Supp. Tables 1 . Frozen human temporal or frontal cortices containing white and grey matter were weighed. Freshly prepared, ice cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS) consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 was added to the frozen cortex at 4:1 (TBS volume:brain wet wt) and homogenized with 25 strokes at a setting of 10 on a mechanical Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was spun at 175,000 g in a TLA100.2 rotor on a Beckman TL 100. The supernate (called TBS extract) was aliquoted and stored at ?80 °C, and the pellet was re-homogenized (4:1 v:w) in TBS + 1% Triton X-100 and spun as above. The resultant sup (called TBS-TX extract) was aliquoted and stored at ?80 °C, and the pellet was re-homogenized in TBS + 5 M guanidine HCl, pH 8.0, and incubated on a Nutator for 12–16 hr at RT; the resultant sup (GuHCl extract) was aliquoted and stored at ?80 °C. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) One mL aliquots of the TBS-soluble AD brain extract were injected onto a Superdex 75 (10/30HR) column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min into 1 ml SEC fractions using 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 8.5. 750 ?L were removed and stored at ?80°C. The remaining 250 ?L were lyophilized, reconstituted in 15 ?L of 2X lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer, heated at 70 °C for 5 min and electrophoresed on a 26-well 4–12% bis-tris gel using MES running buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to 0.2 ?m nitrocellulose and Western blotted (WB) for A? with 1 ?g/ml 2G3 + 21F12 (gifts of Elan, plc) using the LiCor Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. SEC fractions containing higher order A? assemblies, LDS-stable A? dimers or A? monomers were pooled separately prior to lyophilizing into 450 ?L aliquots. Immunoprecipitation (IP)/WB analysis of A? in human brain extracts We used an IP/WB protocol described previously 6 to detect A? in the TBS, TBS-TX and GuHCl extracts. TBS extracts were IP’ed directly with either polyclonal A? antiserum R1282 (1:50) plus Protein A sepharose (PAS; Sigma) or monoclonal A? antibodies 3D6 (3 ?g/mL) or 2G3 + 21F12 (each at 3 ?g/mL) (gifts of Elan, plc) plus Protein G agarose (PGA; Roche) and PAS. GuHCl extracts were diluted 1:40 in DMEM and then IP’ed with R1282 (at 1:50) and PAS or else with 2 ?g/mL 266+2G3+21F12 and PGA and PAS. Silver staining used the SilverQuest kit fast protocol (Invitrogen). Hippocampal slice electrophysiology recording The Harvard Medical School Standing Committee on Animals approved all experiments involving vertebrate animals used for electrophysiology and dendritic spine analysis. Standard field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus were recorded. A unipolar stimulating electrode (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) was placed in the Schaffer collaterals of CA3 neurons to deliver test and conditioning stimuli. A borosilicate glass recording electrode filled with ACSF was positioned in stratum radiatum of CA1, 200–300 ?m from the stimulating electrode. fEPSPs in CA1 were induced by 2 test stimuli at 0.05 Hz with an intensity that elicited a fEPSP amplitude 40~50% of maximum. Once a stable test response was attained for at least 30–60 min, experimental treatments were added to the 9.5 mL ACSF perfusate, and a baseline was recorded for an additional 20 min. These treatments included: 500 ?L TBS extract, 500 ?L TBS vehicle, 50 ?M AP-V, 500 ?M (R/S)-MCPG (Tocris) or 3 ?M SIB1757. Lyophilized 450 ?L aliquots of SEC fractions of GuHCl extracts described above were reconstituted in 500 ?L ACSF and added to the slice perfusates. To induce LTP, we applied two consecutive trains (1 s) of stimuli at 100 Hz separated by 20 s, a protocol that induced LTP lasting approximately 1.5 hr in wt mice of this genetic background. To induce LTD, 300 pulses were delivered at 1 Hz. The field potentials were amplified 100x using an Axon Instruments 200B amplifer and digitized with Digidata 1322A. The data were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Traces were obtained by pClamp 9.2 and analyzed using the Clampfit 9.2 program. LTP and LTD values reported throughout were measured at 60 min after the conditioning stimulus unless stated otherwise. Paired-pulse responses were monitored at 50 ms inter-stimulus intervals. The facilitation ratio was calculated as fEPSP2 slope/fEPSP1 slope. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test were used to determine statistical significance. Passive Avoidance Conditioning Passive avoidance training was performed as described previously 18 (see Supplemental Methods ). Wistar rats were administered AD TBS or AD TBS immunodepleted with R1282 at 0, 3, or 6 hr post-training. Recall of the passive avoidance conditioning was evaluated 24 and 48 hr post-training by recording the latency to enter the dark chamber, with a criterion time of 300 s. Data from the passive avoidance studies were analyzed by ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test. Dendritic spine density analysis The apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in organotypic hippocampal slices were prepared, treated, imaged and analyzed as described 17 (see Supplemental Methods ). Slices were treated for 10 d with AD TBS-SEC or Con TBS-SEC. Pharmacologic treatments were performed with 20 ?M D-CPP or 500 ?M (R/S)-MCPG in the presence or absence of AD TBS-SEC for 10 d.

Supplementary Material  Figures Figure 1 Monomeric and oligomeric A? is detected in brain extracts of humans with clinically and neuropathologically typical late-onset AD. IP/WB analysis (see Methods) was performed on supernatants of the soluble ( a , TBS), membrane-associated ( b , TBS-TX100) and insoluble ( c , GuHCl) sequential extracts of frontal (F) and temporal (T) cortex homogenates from various individuals diagnosed with different forms of dementia (see Supp. Table 1 ). Samples were IP’ed with polyclonal A? antibody R1282 and blotted with monoclonals 2G3 (A?40) + 21F12 (A?42). Subject key: DS, Down’s syndrome with AD; DLB, dementia with Lewy bodies; PCD, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration; AD, Alzheimer’s disease; MID, multi-infarct dementia; P-AD, “pathological AD” (i.e., scattered amyloid plaques without a history of clinical AD); FTD, frontotemporal dementia. See Supp. Table 1a for further information. Figure 2 Soluble A? extracted from AD brain alters hippocampal synapse physiology and learned behavior. ( a ) IP/WB of the TBS brain extracts used to study LTP. Clinical and neuropathological diagnoses for each of these seven cases are provided in Supp. Table 1b . ( b ) Summary data of LTP induction following two 100 Hz stimuli (HFS, arrow) of slices treated with 500 ?L each of TBS vehicle (Veh; n =8 slices), Con 1 TBS extract (Con TBS; n =6) or AD 4 TBS extract (AD TBS; n =8). Insets show average baseline (light) and post-HFS (dark) fEPSP traces; calibration bars 5 msec/0.2 mV. ( c ) LTP is induced normally in hippocampal slices treated with 500 ?L of immunodepleted AD TBS (AD TBS-ID). The summary LTP data for Con TBS (blue, n =6 slices) and AD TBS (red, n =8 slices) from Fig. 2b are represented as horizontal bars depicting means ± SEMs of fEPSP slopes at ~50–60 min post-HFS. Inset : Two sequential IP’s (R1282) of AD TBS blotted with 2G3+21F12. ( d ) Summary LTP data (means ± SEMs) for 3 different control subjects (Con 1, n =6; Con 2, n =6; Con 3, n =6), 4 AD subjects (AD 4 n =8; AD 5, n =5; AD 6, n =6; AD 7, n =6), 1 FTD subject ( n =5) and 1 DLB subject ( n =6). For comparison, LTP data from Fig. 2b for Veh are represented by the grey horizontal bar. * P <0.05 compared with Veh. ( e ) Summary LTD data for slices treated with 500 ?L Con TBS (blue, n =7) or AD TBS (red, n =8) for 10 min prior to a weak stimulation protocol of 300 pulses at 1 Hz, indicated by the small grey bar. Calibration bars 5 msec/0.2 mV. ( f ) Summary LTD data for co-administration of AD TBS with either 50 ?M AP-V (black, n =8), 500 ?M (R/S)-MCPG (green, n =7) or 3 ?M SIB1757 (orange, n =6). For comparison, LTD data (means ± SEM) for Con TBS (blue) and AD TBS (red) are shown as horizontal bars. ( g ) Cumulative probability distribution representing escape latency for animals receiving AD TBS (red) or AD TBS-ID (black) at 48 hr after training. Animals receiving AD TBS had a significantly shorter mean escape latency than animals receiving AD TBS-ID (174 ± 31.7 sec and 255 ± 22.8 sec, respectively; P <0.05; n =11 and 10 rats). h. Summary spine density data for pyramidal cells exposed to SEC-enriched TBS extract from AD brain (AD TBS-SEC) or from Con brain (Con TBS-SEC) and also for slices treated with 500 ?M MCPG or 20 ?M CPP in the presence or absence of AD TBS-SEC. *,# P <0.05 vs. Con TBS-SEC and vs. AD TBS-SEC, respectively. Figure 3 Soluble dimers are the smallest A? assembly form in human brain to acutely perturb synapse physiology. ( a ) TBS extracts of AD (top panel) and control (bottom panel) brains were subjected to non-denaturing SEC. SEC fractions were lyophilized and WB’d with 2G3+21F12; molecular weights (in kDa) on left. Note that A? monomer and dimer in the AD TBS extract is recovered from material that elutes at the end of the void volume (fractions 3/4). Control (Con) brain extracts were devoid of A?. ( b ) Summary LTP data (means ± SEMs) for slices treated with SEC fractions from AD or Con TBS extracts ( n =6 slices for all samples), as characterized in Fig. 3a. ( c ) Representative WB (2G3+21F12) of IP-SEC fractionation of AD TBS and Con TBS. TBS extracts (500 ?L) were immunoprecipitated with 3D6 (3 ?g/mL), eluted with sample buffer and subjected to SEC. Dimer-enriched (fractions 7–8) and monomer-enriched (fractions 10–11) IP-SEC fractions were separately pooled, as were corresponding fractions from Con TBS. ( d ) Summary LTP data (means ± SEMs) for slices treated with IP-SEC fractions of AD and control brain TBS extracts, as characterized in Fig. 3c (Con fractions 10–11, n =5; AD fractions 10–11, n =5; Con fractions 7–8, n =7; AD fractions 7–8, n =7). ( e ) Mutant A?40-S26C forms dimers under oxidizing conditions (ox), which can be reduced to monomers by treating with ?-ME (red). Silver stain was performed with 100 ng wildtype A?40 (wt) peptide or the mutant peptide ( f ) Summary LTP data (means ± SEMs) for slices treated with 5, 50, or 100 nM of either wt A?40 (black) or oxidized A?40-S26C (red) reveals that the oxidized A?40-S26C dimer inhibits LTP with much greater potency (100 nM A?40-S26C, n =4; n =5 for all other treatments). The vehicle controls (plotted at 0 nM) were 50 mM ammonium acetate ( n =4) for the S26C peptide and 0.1% ammonium hydroxide ( n =4) for wt peptide. Figure 4 Insoluble amyloid cores contain A? dimers with synaptotoxic potential but are not readily released. ( a ) IP/WB of sequential extracts of the TBS-insoluble pellet prepared from 100 mg of a plaque-rich AD brain (case AD 5 from Fig. 2a ) (see Methods). The final TBS washes reveal that no additional soluble A? can be extracted from the pellet after 4 sequential SDS washes. The remaining core-rich pellet was then incubated in formic acid (FA core extract) and analyzed by IP/WB, revealing that the insoluble cores contain A? monomers and dimers (far right lane). ( b ) Core preps following the final TBS wash as in Fig. 4a were stained with 0.2% Congo red and visualized by brightfield (left) and polarization (right) microscopy. Isolated amyloid cores display characteristic birefringence with Congo red (red arrowheads). Material prepared similarly from Con 3 ( Fig. 2a ) did not contain any such structures. Scale bar = 5 ?m. ( c ) Cores prepared as in Figs. 4a, b were extracted with 88% formic acid and neutralized with NaOH. Summary LTP data for slices treated with just FA/NaOH vehicle (FA Veh, n =5), or with FA/NaOH core extracts from AD (AD core FA extract, n =7) or control (Con core FA extract, n =5) brains. Calibration bars, 5 msec/0.2 mV. ( d ) Summary LTP data for slices exposed to intact core preps isolated as in Fig. 4a, b from 100 mg AD cortex (AD core prep, n =5) or Con cortex (Con core prep, n =5). Calibration bars, 5 msec/0.3 mV.
