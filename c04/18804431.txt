Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress, PrP Trafficking, and Neurodegeneration In this issue of Developmental Cell , Rane et al. report a cellular pathway to link PrPSc, via ER stress and the activation of a preemptive quality control process, to neurodegeneration in a PrP-dependent manner. This pathway puts together several pieces in the puzzle of the relationship between PrPSc and brain damage and may in part explain the mechanism of prion neurodegeneration.
