Integrated actions of PR and cell cycle machinery regulate breast cancer cell proliferation Multiple laboratories have investigated PR involvement in breast cancer cell cycle progression. There is now a growing body of evidence demonstrating complex interactions between PR and cell cycle regulatory proteins. Here we review the current literature linking PR to cell cycle control and discuss gaps in the current knowledge. A more complete understanding of the relationships between PR and cell cycle regulatory molecules may reveal additional avenues for prevention and treatment of steroid receptor positive breast cancers.  Conclusions Coordination of PR transcriptional activity, phosphorylation state and association with specific cyclin/CDK complexes suggests that PR regulates genes in a cell cycle phase-dependent manner. As most of the current studies looking at PR target genes have used unsynchronized cells, it is possible that key PR target genes have been missed. In particular, a subset of S phase genes may be regulated by phosphorylated PR in the absence of progesterone. The discovery of these genes may provide clues to how progestin/PR may contribute to development and/or progression of breast cancer. A more complete understanding of the coupling of PR target gene regulation to cell cycle control may reveal additional avenues for prevention and treatment of steroid receptor positive breast cancers.
