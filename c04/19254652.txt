Health Care Inequities: An Introduction for Dermatology Providers  Conclusion When differences in health and healthcare are avoidable and unfair, they are labeled health inequities. In large part health inequities reflect social determinants of health, lack of access to care and a health care system that does not allow sufficient time and resources so high quality care may be provided to all patients. Melanoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and possibly Kaposi sarcoma are among the cutaneous diseases that have been associated with worse prognosis in minorities in large part due to presentation at advance stages. Programs aiming at reducing health disparities must include the provision of services as well as address access to care and socio-economic barriers.
