Orally delivered siRNA targeting macrophage Map4k4 suppresses systemic inflammation Gene silencing by double-stranded RNA, denoted RNA interference, represents a new paradigm for rational drug design 1 . However, the transformative therapeutic potential of short interfering RNA (siRNA) has been stymied by a key obstacle—safe delivery to specified target cells in vivo 2 . Macrophages are particularly attractive targets for RNA interference therapy because they promote pathogenic inflammatory responses in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes 3 . Here we report the engineering of ?1,3- d -glucan-encapsulated siRNA particles (GeRPs) as efficient oral delivery vehicles that potently silence genes in mouse macrophages in vitro and in vivo . Oral gavage of mice with GeRPs containing as little as 20 µg kg?1 siRNA directed against tumour necrosis factor ? (Tnf-?)depleted its messenger RNA in macrophages recovered from the peritoneum, spleen, liver and lung, and lowered serum Tnf-? levels. Screening with GeRPs for inflammation genes revealed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (Map4k4) is a previously unknown mediator of cytokine expression. Importantly, silencing Map4k4 in macrophages in vivo protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality by inhibiting Tnf-? and interleukin-1? production. This technology defines a new strategy for oral delivery of siRNA to attenuate inflammatory responses in human disease.  METHODS Preparation of ?1,3-<sc>d</sc>-glucan shells ?1,3- d -glucan shells were prepared as described previously 7 . Baker’s yeast (AB Mauri Food Inc.) was alkaline-and-acid-extracted and dried at 20–25 °C following alcohol and acetone extractions. ?1,3- d -glucan shells are 2–4 µm hollow, porous microspheres consisting primarily of ?1,3- d -glucan and typically contain 5 × 1011 particles per g 7 . Fluorescein labelling of ?1,3-<sc>d</sc>-glucan shells ?1,3- d -glucan shells (1 g) were washed with sodium carbonate buffer (0.1 M, pH 9.2) and resuspended in 0.1 l carbonate buffer. 5-(4,6-dichlorotriazinyl) aminofluorescein (Invitrogen; 1 mg ml?1 in DMSO) was added to the buffered ?1,3- d -glucan shell suspension (10% v/v) and mixed at 20–25 °C in the dark for 16 h. Tris buffer (2 mM) was added, incubated for 15 min and ?1,3- d -glucan shells washed with sterile pyrogen-free water until the colour was removed. The ?1,3- d -glucan shells were then dehydrated with absolute ethanol and acetone and dried in the dark at 20–25 °C. Preparation of GeRPs For empty GeRPs, dry ?1,3- d -glucan shells were mixed with a volume of yeast RNA (Sigma; 10 mg ml?1 in 50 mM Tris HCl, pH8, 2 mM EDTA and 0.15 M NaCl (TEN)) to minimally swell the shells, and were incubated for 2 h at room temperature to allow for RNA absorption as described previously 7 . Neutral PEI (Aldrich; 25 kDa branched PEI; 2 mg ml?1 in TEN, pH7) was added in excess to form ?1,3- d -glucan -shell-encapsulated RNA complexes, and these were resuspended by homogenization and incubated for at least 1 h. The ?1,3- d -glucan-shell-encapsulated cationic complexes were sterilized in 70% ethanol, washed and resuspended in sterile pyrogen-free saline, counted by a haematocytometer (200×), diluted to 1 × 109 shells per ml in saline and stored at ?20 °C. For loading of siRNA into GeRPs for in vitro experiments, 1 × 107 empty GeRPs were diluted with sterile saline and incubated with 1 nmole Endo-Porter (Gene Tools) for 1 h at 20–25 °C. Next, 40 pmoles of siRNA was added and incubated at 20–25 °C for 2 h (all of the in vitro experiments contained 40 pmoles siRNA with the exception of the in vitro dose response, which loaded 1.6, 4, 40 or 80 pmoles of siRNA). Then, PEI (5 µg in saline) was added while vortexing and incubated at 20–25 °C for 20 min to trap the siRNA in the GeRPs. The PEI was quenched by the addition of 600 µl of complete DMEM. siRNA-loaded GeRPs were added to cells in culture at a concentration of 1 × 107 GeRPs per 1 × 106 cells. For loading of siRNA into GeRPs for in vivo experiments, the same procedure was followed with an adjusted ratio of 40 pmoles of siRNA in 1 × 108 empty GeRPs per dose. Empty GeRPs were incubated with 1 nmole Endo-Porter for 1 h at 20–25 °C. Next, 40 pmoles of siRNA was added, incubated at 20–25 °C for 2 h and trapped with PEI (50 µg) for 20 min at 20–25 °C. The siRNA-loaded GeRPs were then washed, resuspended in saline and sonicated to ensure homogeneity of the GeRP preparation. For each experiment, GeRP batches were aliquoted into tubes for daily dosing, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at ?20 °C. The final oral dose of GeRPs in 200 µl contains 40 pmole siRNA in 1 × 108 GeRPs. Tissue macrophage isolation C57BL6/J male mice (ten-week-old) were administered 1 × 108 GeRPs by daily oral gavage for 8 days. On day 9, mice were i.p. injected with thioglycollate. Cells from spleen, liver, lung, muscle and PECs were isolated on day 10. Tissues were cut into small pieces, washed with PBS and digested at 37 °C for 30 min with agitation using 5 mg ml?1 collagenase. Digested tissues were filtered through 70-µm pore nylon mesh, centrifuged, and the cells were plated in plastic dishes for 2–3 h in medium (DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum). The cells were washed with PBS to remove non-adherent cells, and adherent cells were used for real-time PCR and microscopy. For confocal experiments, mice were gavaged with a single 2 × 108 dose of GeRPs, and tissue macrophages isolated after 24 h as described previously. Microscopy Fixed cells from in vitro and in vivo experiments were incubated with F4/80 primary antibody (AbD Serotec) followed by AlexaFluor350 or 633 secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained with Hoescht 33342 or DAPI as denoted in the figure legends. Isolation of RNA and real-time PCR RNA isolation was performed according to the Trizol reagent protocol (Invitrogen). Complementary DNA was synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For real-time PCR, synthesized cDNA forward and reverse primers along with the iQ SYBR Green Supermix were run on the MyIQ real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad). Sequences of the primers used were designed with Primer Bank ( Supplementary Table 4 ). The ribosomal mRNA 36B4 was used as an internal loading control, as its expression did not change over a 24 h period with the addition of LPS, TNF-? or siRNA against the genes used in this study. ELISA assay Tnf-? levels in the PEC supernatant, plasma and peritoneal fluids and interferon-? levels in plasma were measured using mouse ELISA kits (Pierce) as recommended by the manufacturer. AST and ALT measurement To test for liver toxicity, levels of ALT and AST activity in serum were measured using a commercial kit (Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Histology and TUNEL assay Tissue sections were stained with F4/80–AlexaFluor405 antibody (AbD-Serotec) and were haematoxylin-stained. TUNEL assay was performed on liver sections from mice challenged with LPS/ d -GalN according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Upstate). TUNEL images were obtained using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam HR CCD camera with 1,300 × 1,030 pixels basic resolution and a Zeiss Plan NeoFluar 20×/0.50 Ph2 (DIC II) objective. Zeiss Aprochromat 100×/1.40 Oil (440780). Tissue and cell images were obtained with a Solamere CSU10 Spinning Disk confocal system mounted on a Nikon TE2000-E2 inverted microscope. Images were taken with a multi-immersion ×20 objective with a NA = 0.75, oil:W.D. = 0.35 mm, or a ×100 Plan Apo VC objective NA = 1.4, oil:W.D. = 0.13 mm.

Supplementary Material supplementary  Figures Figure 1 Production of fluorescent GeRPs ?1,3- d -glucan particles were purified from baker’s yeast by a series of alkaline and solvent extractions, hydrolysing outer cell wall and intracellular components and yielding purified, porous 2–4 µm, hollow ?1,3- d -glucan particles (diagram of particles, left; procedure, middle; microscopy of particles, right).
