Genome-wide association and replication studies identify four variants associated with prostate cancer susceptibility We report a genome-wide association follow up study on prostate cancer. We identify four variants associated with the disease in European populations: rs10934853-A (OR = 1.12, P = 2.9×10?10) on 3q21.3, two moderately correlated (r2 = 0.07) variants on 8q24.21; rs16902094-G (OR = 1.21, P = 6.2×10?15) and rs445114-T (OR = 1.14, P = 4.7×10?10) and rs8102476-C (OR = 1.12, P = 1.6×10?11) on 19q13.2. We also refine a previous association signal on 11q13 with the SNP rs11228565-A (OR =1.23, P = 6.7 × 10?12). In a multi-variant analysis, using 22 prostate cancer risk variants typed in the Icelandic population, we estimate that carriers belonging to the top 1.3% of the risk distribution have a risk of developing the disease that is more than 2.5 times greater than the population average risk estimates.  Online Methods Genotyping Methods Illumina genotyping 1,968 and 35,382 Icelandic case- and control-samples respectively, were successfully assayed with the Infinium HumanHap300 SNP chip (Illumina, SanDiego, CA, USA), containing 317,503 haplotype tagging SNPs derived from phase I of the International HapMap project. Of the SNPs assayed on the chip, 2,906 SNPs had a yield lower than 95%, 271 SNPs had a minor allele frequency, in the combined set of cases and controls, below 0.01 or were monomorphic. An additional 4,632 SNPs showed a significant distortion from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the controls ( P < 1.0×10?3). In total, 6,983 unique SNPs were removed from the study. Thus, the analysis reported in the main text utilizes 310,520 SNPs. Any samples with a call rate below 98% were excluded from the analysis. Replication genotyping Single SNP genotyping of the SNPs reported in the main text for the four case-control groups from Iceland, The Netherlands, Spain and Chicago was carried out by deCODE Genetics in Reykjavik, Iceland, applying the Centaurus 20 (Nanogen) platform. The quality of each Centaurus SNP assay was evaluated by genotyping each assay in the CEU and/or YRI HapMap samples and comparing the results with the HapMap publicly released data. Assays with >1.5% mismatch rate were not used and a linkage disequilibrium (LD) test was used for markers known to be in LD. We re-genotyped more than 10% of the samples and observed a mismatch rate lower than 0.5%. Genotyping of samples from Finland and Nashville was done using the same Centaurus assays as used in Iceland at the University of Tampere and Vanderbilt University, respectively, using standard protocols. For each of the SNPs discussed in the main text, the yield was higher than 95% for those samples which genotyping was attempted for in every study group. The SNPs rs16902094 on 8q24 and rs11228565 on 11q13 are not present on the Human Hap300 chip. Therefore, using a single SNP assay for genotyping, an attempt was made to genotype 6,900 and 800 individuals, respectively, of the 35,382 Icelandic controls as well as 1,860 Icelandic cases and all available individuals from the replication study groups. Discovery of new SNP on 8q24 by Solexa re-sequencing In order to search for new SNPs on 8q24, a 527 kb region (128113108 – 128640337 bp, Build 36) was sequenced using the Solexa re-sequencing platform (Illumina Inc.). From our set of ~2,000 cases, 800 were selected randomly and split into two DNA-pools, each with 400 samples. Similarly, 800 control individuals, not known to have prostate cancer, were selected randomly and split into two DNA-pools. Dilutions were prepared in duplicates for the 4 pools and used for longe-range PCR reactions (each amplimer consisted of about 10 kb). PCR fragments were run on 0.8% agarose gels and the DNA visualized with BlueView (Sigma Inc.) under normal light and their sizes estimated with HindIII digested lambda size marker (Fermentas Inc). Bands of correct sizes were excised out of the agarose gels and purified with Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.). The PCR products were quantified by picogreen assay (Invitrogen Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. The preparation of the Solexa DNA libraries, the cluster generation and DNA sequencing was done was done as described by Bentley et al 21 . The SNP Analysis pipeline is composed of four components: Alignment, SNP calling, Filtering and Association analysis. Promising SNPs were selected for further study/confirmation using Centaurus single track SNP assays. Statistical analysis Association analysis For SNPs that were in strong LD, whenever the genotype of one SNP was missing for an individual, the genotype of the correlated SNP was used to provide partial information through a likelihood approach as previously described 9 . This ensured that results presented in Supplementary Table 5 were based on the same number of individuals, allowing meaningful comparisons of results for correlated SNPs. A likelihood procedure described in a previous publication 22 and implemented in the NEMO software was used for the association analyses. We tested the association of an allele to prostate cancer using a standard likelihood ratio statistic that, if the subjects were unrelated, would have asymptotically a ? 2 distribution with one degree of freedom under the null hypothesis. Allelic frequencies rather than carrier frequencies are presented for the markers in the main text. Allele-specific ORs and associated P values were calculated assuming a multiplicative model for the two chromosomes of an individual 23 . Results from multiple case-control groups were combined using a Mantel-Haenszel model 24 in which the groups were allowed to have different population frequencies for alleles, haplotypes and genotypes but were assumed to have common relative risks (see Gudmundsson et al . 3 for a more detailed description of the association analysis). The control groups from Iceland, The Netherlands, Spain, and Finland include both male and female controls. No significant difference between male and female controls was detected for SNPs presented in Table 1 for each of these four groups. Controls from other study groups include only males. In order to assess the association for the SNP rs4962416 on 10q26, which is in the CEU section of the Hapmap database but absent from the Illumina Hap300 chip, we use a method based on haplotypes of two markers (rs7077275 and rs893856) present on the chip. We used a method we have previously employed 25 , that is an extension of the two-marker haplotype tagging method 26 and is similar in spirit to two other proposed methods 27 , 28 . We computed associations with a linear combination of the different haplotypes chosen to act as surrogates to HapMap markers in the regions. These calculations were based on 1,724 prostate cancer cases and 35,322 controls genotyped on chip. Multivariant analysis In a multi-variant analysis, we combined the effect of 22 variants affecting risk of prostate cancer using estimates based on data from only the Icelandic study group. A multiplicative model was assumed at each variant and between all variants. For the 21 autosomal variants we tested for deviation from the multiplicative model comparing it to the full model of genotypic odds ratio (OR). No significant (given the number of tests performed) deviation from the multiplicative model was detected (all P-values > 0.0024, corresponding to 0.05 divided by 21). For the variant located on the X chromosome (rs5945572), there exist only two male genotypes (carrier and no-carrier). Also, we tested the pair-wise interactions between the 22 risk variants using logistic regressions including terms corresponding to the 231 possible pairs. No significant (given the number of tests performed) deviation from the multiplicative model was detected with a level of significance below 0.00022 (corresponding to P = 0.05 divided by 231). Similarly, the absence of interaction between variants has previously been reported by others 5 , 16 , 29 . Odds ratios were calculated for all possible genotype combinations based on these 22 variants and expressed relative to the average general population risk. The combined OR estimates were then divided into OR-ranges and presented along with the percentage of the population within each OR-range (See Table 3 in the main text). The general population risk was determined using a frequency-weighted average risk for all possible genotypes. The Icelandic samples were part of the initial discovery study populations for 10 of these 22 variants, therefore the estimates for these may be inflated due to winners curse. From Table 1 we are using the estimates for the following variants: rs10934853 on 3q21.3, rs11228565 on 11q13 and rs8102476 on 19q13.2. For the five variants (rs1447295, rs6983267, rs16901979, rs16902094 and rs445114) on 8q24.21 we are using the adjusted estimates as reported in Supplementary Table 3b . From Table 2 , we use the estimates for all variants except rs1571801 on 9q33 since its effect was in the opposite direction compared to the original publication, and rs10896450 on 11q13 for which data for the refinement SNP (rs11228565) in Table 1 was used. Furthermore, for the two variants on 17q12, reported in Table 2 , we are using the estimates adjusted for each other since the two markers are located ~25 kb to each other although not correlated (D’ = 0.03, r2 = 0.0004 according to CEU HapMap data); rs4430796 has an adjusted OR of 1.17 and rs11649743 has an adjusted OR of 1.06. We apply the combined genetic relative risk to the lifetime risk by multiplying them together. Since the association with the disease for these variants has not been shown to depend on age at diagnosis 3 , 16 , we assume that the individual estimates for each variant will have a similar effect at any given age. The lifetime risk of getting prostate cancer is estimated to be 12%, on average in Iceland, before the age of 75, according to NORDCAN (see URL). Analysis of the CGEMS data For the five individual study populations from the CGEMS study 5 , 7 (ACS = American Cancer Society Prevention Study II (US); ATBC = Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Prevention Study (Finland); FPCC: CeRePP French Prostate Case-Control Study (France); HPFS = Health Professionals Follow-up Study (US); PLCO = Prostate, Lung, Colon, Ovarian Trial (US)), when assessing the allelic effect we used the pre-computed data (released in spring, 2008) corresponding to “All case versus control (dichotomous), genotype trend effect model, adjusted”. When assessing the genotypic effect at each loci for the CGEMS study we used the pre-computed “All case versus control (dichotomous), genotype-specific effect model, adjusted, ALL (ACS, HPFS, FPCC, ATBC, PLCO)”. Correction for relatedness Some individuals in the Icelandic case-control groups were related to each other, causing the aforementioned ?2 test statistic to have a mean >1. We estimated the inflation factor by using a previously described procedure 30 in which we simulated genotypes through the genealogy of the 37,350 Icelanders analyzed in the present study (number of simulations = 100,000). The inflation factor was estimated to be 1.10. Results from the Icelandic samples presented in the main text are based on adjusting the ?2 statistics by dividing each of them by 1.10.  Genotyping Methods Illumina genotyping 1,968 and 35,382 Icelandic case- and control-samples respectively, were successfully assayed with the Infinium HumanHap300 SNP chip (Illumina, SanDiego, CA, USA), containing 317,503 haplotype tagging SNPs derived from phase I of the International HapMap project.
