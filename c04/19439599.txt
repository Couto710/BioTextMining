TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels cooperate with TRPV4 to mediate mechanical hyperalgesia and nociceptor sensitization The transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) contributes to mechanical hyperalgesia of diverse etiologies, presumably as part of a mechanoreceptor signaling complex ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2008 ). To investigate the hypothesis that a functional interaction between TRPV4 and stretch-activated ion channels (SACs) is involved in this mechanical transduction mechanism, we used a selective SACs inhibitor, GsMTx-4. Intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 in the rat hind paw reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by intradermal injection of inflammatory mediators. In vivo single fiber recordings showed that GsMTx-4 reversed inflammatory mediator-induced decrease in mechanical threshold in half of sensitized C-fibers. Furthermore, GsMTx-4 reduced hyperalgesia to both mechanical and hypotonic stimuli in different models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain while it had no effect on baseline mechanical nociceptive thresholds. TRPC1 and TRPC6, two GsMTx-4-sensitive SACs are expressed in dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRG). Single-cell RT-PCR showed that messenger RNAs for TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 are frequently co-expressed in DRG neurons. Spinal intrathecal administration of oligodeoxynucleotides antisense to TRPC1 and TRPC6, like that to TRPV4, reversed the hyperalgesia to mechanical and hypotonic stimuli induced by inflammatory mediators without affecting baseline mechanical nociceptive threshold. However, antisense to TRPC6, but not to TRPC1, reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by a thermal injury or the TRPV4 selective agonist 4?-PDD. We conclude that TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels cooperate with TRPV4 channels to mediate mechanical hyperalgesia and primary afferent nociceptor sensitization although they may have distinctive roles.  Introduction The growing number of probable mechanical transducers ( Lumpkin and Caterina, 2007 ) and the emergence of new models of mechanical gating such as the “tensegrity model” ( Ingber, 1997 , 2003a , 2003b ) suggest that the transduction of mechanical stimuli in primary afferent nociceptors depends on the activation of mechanoreceptor signaling complexes rather than a simple stretch-activated mechanotransducer. The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) plays a major role in the mechanical hyperalgesia associated with pronociceptive inflammatory mediators and small-fiber painful peripheral neuropathies ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2004 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2008 ). While TRPV4 does not appear to be gated by mechanical stretch ( Strotmann et al., 2000 ) and does not contribute to baseline mechanical nociceptive threshold ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ; Liedtke and Friedman, 2003 ; Suzuki et al., 2003 ), it does contribute to mechanical transduction in sensitized primary afferent nociceptors by functional coupling with other molecules implicated in mechanotransduction such as integrins and Src tyrosine kinases ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2008 ). While stretch-activated channels (SACs) also participate in the detection of mechanical stimuli in dorsal root ganglion neurons ( McCarter et al., 1999 ; Cho et al., 2002 ; Hu and Lewin, 2006 ), the use of non-selective blockers has hampered our understanding of their role in mechanotransduction ( Hamill and McBride, 1996 ; Hamill, 2006 ). Recently, more selective SAC blockers have emerged ( Suchyna et al., 2000 ; Meyers et al., 2003 ; Drew et al., 2007 ). One of these, GsMTx-4, a small peptide found in the venom of the Chilean rose tarantula spider Grammostola spatula , specifically blocks cationic SACs ( Suchyna et al., 2000 ; Bowman et al., 2007 ). Intraperitoneal injection of GsMTx-4 has recently been shown to reduce mechanical hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan or sciatic nerve injury ( Park et al., 2008 ) although it does not inhibit SAC currents in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons ( Drew et al., 2007 ). GsMTx-4 inhibits two members of the canonical subfamily of TRP channels, TRPC1 and TRPC6, which are expressed in DRG neurons and activated by mechanical and hypotonic stimuli ( Maroto et al., 2005 ; Spassova et al., 2006 ; Bowman et al., 2007 ; Elg et al., 2007 ; Kress et al., 2008 ). In the present study, we investigated whether SACs, and more specifically TRPC1 and TRPC6, may function with TRPV4 to transduce mechanical stimuli in sensitized nociceptors. We demonstrate that local injection of GsMTx-4, at the site of nociceptive testing, reverses hyperalgesia to mechanical and hypotonic stimuli induced by combinations of inflammatory mediators, carrageenan or the cancer chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, without affecting baseline nociceptive mechanical threshold. Similarly, TRPC1 and TRPC6 participate in the hyperalgesia to mechanical and hypotonic stimuli induced by inflammatory mediators without contributing to baseline nociceptive mechanical threshold. We suggest that TRPC6 and TRPC1 contribute, with TRPV4, to a mechanism mediating primary afferent nociceptor sensitization and mechanical hyperalgesia.  Material and Methods Animals Experiments were performed on 180-200 g adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Hollister, CA) and on male C57BL/6 mice lacking functional TRPV4 gene (TRPV4-/- mice) ( Liedtke and Friedman, 2003 ) and male TRPV4 wild-type littermates (TRPV4+/+ mice). The genotype of the mice was confirmed by PCR of tail DNA. Experimental protocols were approved by the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Animal Research and conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of animals in research. Drugs Paclitaxel, carrageenan, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), serotonin (5-HT), histamine, substance P and 4 ?-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4?-PDD) were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO), bradykinin was purchased from ICN biomedicals (Aurora, OH) and GsMTx-4 from Peptides International Inc. (Louisville, KY). For behavioral experiments, stock solutions of carrageenan, bradykinin, 5-HT, substance P and histamine were made in saline. Stock solutions of PGE2 and GsMTx-4 were made in 10% ethanol and in distilled water, respectively. For all drugs, final experimental dilutions were made in saline on the day of the experiment (final concentrations of ethanol or DMSO were <1%). Pain models Carrageenan and inflammatory soup A solution of either carrageenan (1% w/v, 5 ?l), inflammatory soup (PGE2, 5-HT, histamine, substance P and bradykinin, 100 ng each, final volume 2.5 ?l) or simplified inflammatory soup (PGE2 and 5-HT, 100 ng each, final volume 2.5 ?l) was injected intradermally into the dorsum of the rat hind paw 30 min before behavioral testing. Paclitaxel chemotherapy-induced neuropathy Paclitaxel was formulated at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in a vehicle composed of absolute ethanol and Cremophore EL; final paclitaxel concentration of 1 ?g/2.5 ?l was made in sterile saline at the time of injection ( Dina et al., 2001 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2004 ). Paclitaxel was injected intraperitoneally once a day for 10 days at a dose of 1 mg/kg. GsMTx-4 was tested on day 11. Hind paw thermal injury After measuring baseline mechanical thresholds, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5% in 97.5% O2). A brass probe with a surface temperature clamped at 52.5 C (±0.1°C) was applied, pressure between the dorsum of the hind paw and the probe was maintained with a 9 g sand pouch for 40s ( Summer et al., 2006 ; Summer et al., 2007a ). Baseline mechanical threshold testing was performed 24 h after burn injury. Mechanical nociceptive threshold Mechanical nociceptive thresholds were evaluated by the Randall-Sellito paw withdrawal test (Ugo-Basile® algesymeter, Stoelting, Chicago, IL) as described previously ( Aley and Levine, 2001 ; Aley et al., 2001 ). The experiments were not run in a blinded manner. Baseline mechanical thresholds were recorded as the mean of 3 measurements (at 10-min intervals) before pharmacological reagents. As a negative control, we verified that the injection of 10% DMSO in rat hind paw had no effect on paw-withdrawal threshold ( Fig. 7A ). PGE2 and 5-HT (100 ng each/2.5 ?l), 4?-PDD or GsMTx-4 were injected intradermally 30 min before behavioral testing. For statistical analysis, each paw was considered to be an independent observation. Flinch test in rats As described previously ( Zheng and Chen, 2001 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ; Zhang et al., 2003 ; Houck et al., 2004 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2008 ), rats were acclimated in a clear plastic observation chamber for 30 min. Then they were briefly restrained while 10 ?l hypotonic solution (deionized water, 17 mOsm) was administered intradermally into the dorsum of the hind paw via a 30-gauge needle connected to a 100-?l syringe by polyethylene tubing. Rats were observed immediately after the injection for a 5-min period and the number of flinches observed was recorded as the flinch score. PGE2 and 5-HT (100 ng each/2.5 ?l), 4-?PDD or GsMTx-4 were injected intradermally 45 min before administration of the hypotonic stimulus at the same site of injection. For the experiments testing the recovery from the acute effect of GsMTx-4, flinching and mechanical thresholds were measured 24 hr after the injection of the drugs. For the experiments testing the recovery from the ODN treatment, flinching and mechanical thresholds were measured 4 days after the last ODN injection; we previously showed that this time frame was compatible with recovery of the expression level of TRPV4 protein ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2004 ). A control group of rats was run in parallel to confirm that repeated testing did not affect the mechanical nociceptive threshold or the number of flinches in response to intradermal injection of a hypotonic solution (data not shown). Oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) preparation and administration The TRPC1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) sequence 5?-TTCTCCTCCTTCACCTCTCG-3? and the TRPC6 antisense ODN sequence 5?-ATAGTCCTGGCTCTCGTTGC-3? (Invitrogen Life technologies), were directed against a unique region of the rat TRPC1 or TRPC6 channels (GeneBank accession number, respectively, NM-053558 and NM-053559). The mismatch ODN sequence was designed by mismatching 7 and 8 bases (denoted by bold face) of the TRPC1 antisense (5?- AA CTCCT GG TTCA G C AG TCG -3?) and TRPC6 antisense (5?- TATC TCCT C GCTCTC CAA GC-3?), respectively. ODN was reconstituted in nuclease-free 0.9% NaCl (10 ?g/?l) and was administered into the spinal intrathecal space at a dose of 40 ?g/20 ?l, once a day for 3 days. For this procedure rats were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane (97.5% O2), a 30-gauge needle was inserted into the subarachnoid space on the midline between L4 and L5 vertebrae, and ODN was injected at 1 ?l/sec by micro-syringe ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ). Antibodies The monoclonal anti-TRPC1 [EP1417Y] antibody (ab51255) generated in rabbit against the epitope KFHDFADRKDWDAFC, corresponding to residues 496-509 of human TRPC1 (Accession # I38361) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). To verify the specificity of this antibody, we tested in parallel the anti-TRPC1 antibody from Alomone Labs (ACC-010), the selectivity of which has been demonstrated ( Kim et al., 2003 ; Liu et al., 2008 ). In addition, we could show a significant decrease in the level of TRPC1 protein after treatment with TRPC1 antisense ODN while the level of TRPC1 protein was not affected by treatment with TRPC6 antisense ODN (data not shown). The polyclonal anti-TRPC6 antibody (ACC-017) generated in rabbits against the epitope RRNESQDYLLMDELG, corresponding to residues 24-38 of mouse TRPC6 (Accession # Q61143), was purchased from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem). The selectivity of this antibody has been previously shown ( Strubing et al., 2003 ; Dalrymple et al., 2004 ; Kress et al., 2008 ; Liu et al., 2008 ). We confirmed the specificity of this antibody by testing in parallel the anti-TRPC6 antibody from Abcam (ab47679). Furthermore, we could show a significant decrease in the level of TRPC6 protein after treatment with TRPC6 antisense ODN while the level of TRPC6 protein remained unaffected by treatment with TRPC1 antisense ODN (data not shown). Western blot To confirm that the reduction in the nociceptive behaviors associated with ODN treatment resulted from a decrease in the level of TRPC1 and TRPC6 protein, lumbar DRG neurons (L5-L6) from ODN-treated rats were harvested 24 h after the last ODN injection. Membrane protein preparation and Western blot analyses were performed as previously described ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ). Briefly, protein concentration for each sample was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method using the MICRO BCA protein Assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology); proteins were loaded on a polyacrylamide gel (30 ?g/lane) and separated by electrophoresis. The membrane was probed with affinity-purified anti-TRPC1 (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or anti-TRPC6 antibody (1:500, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (HRP) goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000, Pierce Biotechnology). To normalize the loaded samples, affinity purified mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:5,000, Abcam) was used, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000, Pierce Biotechnology). Membranes were incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce Biotechnology) and images of the membrane were acquired with the CHEMILMAGER™ chemiluminescence imaging system and analyzed with AlphaEaseFC™ software (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). The density of the band of interest (TRPC1 or TRPC6) was measured and normalized to the density of the band of GAPDH. The percentage decrease in level of expression of the protein was then calculated using the formula; ((average of normalized density for antisense - average of normalized density for mismatch)/average of normalized density for mismatch) * 100. The SEM was calculated with the following formula: (SEM of average of normalized density for antisense/average of normalized density for mismatch) *100. DRG membrane preparation, subcellular fractionation Lumbar DRG (L4-L6) neurons isolated from adult male rats and cultured for 2 days were stimulated with a hypotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT (10 ?M each) for 15 min. Cells were then homogenized in homogenization buffer (10 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, 0.320 M sucrose and complete cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), pH=7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was placed on ice and the pellet resuspended in homogenization buffer. This step was repeated twice. Then, supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 15000 g for 25 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 5 mM Tris-HCl, 0.320 M sucrose and cocktail of proteases inhibitors (pH=8.1), layered on 5 mM Tris-HCl solution containing 1.2 M sucrose and centrifuged at 35000 g for 1 h at 4°C. The membrane fraction was diluted to a final sucrose concentration less than 0.3 M and centrifuged at 20000 g for 90 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was estimated by spectrophotometry at 280 nm. Protein samples were separated on a polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel and Western blot analysis was performed. The membrane was probed in parallel with affinity-purified anti-TRPC1 (1:500, Abcam), anti-TRPC6 antibody (1:500, Alomone Labs) or anti-TRPV4 (1:500, Alomone Labs) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (HRP) goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000, Pierce Biotechnology). In vivo single fiber electrophysiology Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (initially 50 mg/kg, i.p ), with additional doses given throughout the experiment to maintain areflexia. Single C-fibers from the saphenous nerve, with cutaneous receptive fields, were recorded as described previously ( Chen and Levine, 1999 ). Briefly, recordings were made from the saphenous nerve, which innervates the medial–dorsal surface of the hind paw. Bipolar stimulating electrodes were placed under the nerve at a site distal to the recording site. The nerve was crushed proximal to the recording site to prevent flexor reflexes during electrical stimulation of the nerve. Fine fascicles of axons were dissected from the nerve and placed on a silver-wire recording electrode. Single units were first detected by electrical stimulation of the nerve. The conduction velocity of a fiber was determined by dividing the distance between the stimulating and recording electrodes by the action potential latency. Fibers with conduction velocities less than 2 m/sec were classified as C-fibers ( Willis, 1985 ). The action potential corresponding to the C-fiber whose receptive field had been identified was determined by the latency delay technique, in which electrically evoked spikes resulted in longer latency when the receptive field of the same fiber was stimulated ( Handwerker et al., 1991 ). Receptive fields of individual C-fibers were located and measured using a mechanical search stimulus. The fiber was determined as cutaneous if it was activated by lifting and stimulating the skin and/or if the receptive fields move when the skin is moved relative to subcutaneous tissue. Non-cutaneous fibers were not further studied. Spontaneous activity of C-fibers was measured as the number of action potentials fired during a 2-min period, in the absence of applied stimulation. Mechanical threshold was determined with calibrated von Frey hairs (Ainsworth, London, UK) and defined as the lowest force that elicited two or more spikes within 1 sec, in at least 6 of 10 trials. Sustained (60 sec) suprathreshold (10 g) mechanical stimulation was performed using a mechanical stimulator consisting of a force-measuring transducer (Entran, Fairfield, NJ) mounted in series with interchangeable VFH filaments. Once the receptive field was delimited and the response to mechanical stimulus characterized GsMTx-4 (1000 ng in 2.5 ?l) or the simplified soup (PGE2 and 5-HT, 100 ng each in a final volume of 2.5 ?l) were injected intradermally approximately 1 mm from the center of a C-fiber's mechanical receptive field. Dorsal root ganglion cell culture L2-L6 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were harvested from TRPV4+/+ and TRPV4-/- mice and dissociated and cultured as described previously ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ). Briefly, dissociated cells were plated on cover slips treated with poly-DL-ornithine (0.1 mg/ml; Sigma, St Louis, MO) and laminin (5 ?g/ml; Invitrogen) and incubated at 37°C in 96.5% air, 3.5% CO2. Neurons were maintained in culture for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 50-100 ng/ml nerve growth factor, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, MEM vitamins and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (all from Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Calcium imaging Calcium imaging was performed using the fluorescent calcium indicator fura 2-acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2AM) 48 h after dissociation, as described previously ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ). Briefly, neurons were loaded with 5-?M fura-2 AM for 20 min in isotonic solution (312 mOsm). Experiments were carried out at 20-23°C with the perfusion at a flow rate of 1-2 ml/min. Cells were perfused with isotonic solution for 10 min before recordings to allow complete removal of un-hydrolysed fura-ester. Measurement of the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca2+]i) was performed by ratiometric imaging with an intensified charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Fluorescence was excited at 340 and 380 nm and emitted light was long-filtered at 510 nm. The fluorescence ratio, F340/F380, was calculated with METAFLUOR® software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). Calcium calibration was performed with a Fura-2 calcium imaging calibration kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and apparent free [Ca2+]i was calculated from the equation [Ca2+]i= Kd × ((R-Rmin)/(Rmax-R)) × (F380max/F380min) where R is the ratio of 510 nm emission intensity, exciting at 340 nm, to 510 nm emission intensity, exciting at 380 nm; Rmin is the ratio at zero free Ca2+; Rmax is the ratio at saturating Ca2+ (e.g., 39 ?M); F380 max is the fluorescence intensity, exciting at 380 nm, for zero free Ca2+; and F380 min is the fluorescence intensity at saturating free Ca2+. The Kd can be determined from the fura-2-containing Ca2+ standards and was calculated by using the utility available on the manufacturer website. The free Ca2+ for any experimental sample was then calculated from the corresponding R value. Neurons were challenged for 3 min with a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT (10 ?M each), washed for 10 min with isotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT, perfused with an isotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 (500 nM) for 5 min and then challenged with 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 for 3 min. Free Ca2+ was calculated from the normalized fluorescence ratio during a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 divided by the normalized fluorescence ratio in 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT. We minimized conductance via other ion channels than TRPV4 by employing a combination of room temperature, HEPES buffer, and variation of osmolarity only by modifying D-mannitol concentration ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ). Thus, the standard isotonic solution (312 mOsm) contained (in mM): 88 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2.4 CaCl2, 110 D-mannitol, 10 HEPES, and was buffered at pH 7.4 with NaOH. The hypotonic solution was adjusted to 212 mOsm (30% hypotonic) by lowering the amount of D-mannitol to 10 mM. Osmolarity and pH were measured before each experiment. The vehicle for the fura-2 AM, DMSO, at its final working dilution did not induce any response in DRG neurons (data not shown). At the end of each experiment, a short exposure to solution containing 20 mM KCl was performed to confirm that all cells studied exhibited electrical excitability that is typical of healthy neurons. Single-cell RT-PCR Single-cell RT-PCR experiments were conducted as described previously ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ). Briefly, cytoplasm was aspirated into patch clamp electrodes from cultured DRG neurons and reverse transcription performed immediately using cells-to-cDNA™ II kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA). Two successive PCR amplifications were performed for 28 and 38 cycles using HotStar™ Taq Plus DNA Polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The following primer pairs were used for TRPV4 (accession number: NM_022017, nucleotides 1480-1700), TRPC1 (accession number: NM_011643, nucleotides 1843-2010) and TRPC6 (accession number: NM_013838, nucleotides 1417-1644). Gels were analysed with AlphaEaseFC™ software (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). Data analysis Group data are presented as mean±SEM and comparisons between groups performed by Student's t -test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) which, if significant, was followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons post hoc test. Significance was defined as a P-value ?0.05.  Animals Experiments were performed on 180-200 g adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Hollister, CA) and on male C57BL/6 mice lacking functional TRPV4 gene (TRPV4-/- mice) ( Liedtke and Friedman, 2003 ) and male TRPV4 wild-type littermates (TRPV4+/+ mice). The genotype of the mice was confirmed by PCR of tail DNA. Experimental protocols were approved by the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Animal Research and conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of animals in research.  Drugs Paclitaxel, carrageenan, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), serotonin (5-HT), histamine, substance P and 4 ?-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4?-PDD) were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO), bradykinin was purchased from ICN biomedicals (Aurora, OH) and GsMTx-4 from Peptides International Inc. (Louisville, KY). For behavioral experiments, stock solutions of carrageenan, bradykinin, 5-HT, substance P and histamine were made in saline. Stock solutions of PGE2 and GsMTx-4 were made in 10% ethanol and in distilled water, respectively. For all drugs, final experimental dilutions were made in saline on the day of the experiment (final concentrations of ethanol or DMSO were <1%).  Pain models Carrageenan and inflammatory soup A solution of either carrageenan (1% w/v, 5 ?l), inflammatory soup (PGE2, 5-HT, histamine, substance P and bradykinin, 100 ng each, final volume 2.5 ?l) or simplified inflammatory soup (PGE2 and 5-HT, 100 ng each, final volume 2.5 ?l) was injected intradermally into the dorsum of the rat hind paw 30 min before behavioral testing. Paclitaxel chemotherapy-induced neuropathy Paclitaxel was formulated at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in a vehicle composed of absolute ethanol and Cremophore EL; final paclitaxel concentration of 1 ?g/2.5 ?l was made in sterile saline at the time of injection ( Dina et al., 2001 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2004 ). Paclitaxel was injected intraperitoneally once a day for 10 days at a dose of 1 mg/kg. GsMTx-4 was tested on day 11. Hind paw thermal injury After measuring baseline mechanical thresholds, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5% in 97.5% O2). A brass probe with a surface temperature clamped at 52.5 C (±0.1°C) was applied, pressure between the dorsum of the hind paw and the probe was maintained with a 9 g sand pouch for 40s ( Summer et al., 2006 ; Summer et al., 2007a ). Baseline mechanical threshold testing was performed 24 h after burn injury.  Carrageenan and inflammatory soup A solution of either carrageenan (1% w/v, 5 ?l), inflammatory soup (PGE2, 5-HT, histamine, substance P and bradykinin, 100 ng each, final volume 2.5 ?l) or simplified inflammatory soup (PGE2 and 5-HT, 100 ng each, final volume 2.5 ?l) was injected intradermally into the dorsum of the rat hind paw 30 min before behavioral testing.  Paclitaxel chemotherapy-induced neuropathy Paclitaxel was formulated at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in a vehicle composed of absolute ethanol and Cremophore EL; final paclitaxel concentration of 1 ?g/2.5 ?l was made in sterile saline at the time of injection ( Dina et al., 2001 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2004 ). Paclitaxel was injected intraperitoneally once a day for 10 days at a dose of 1 mg/kg. GsMTx-4 was tested on day 11.  Hind paw thermal injury After measuring baseline mechanical thresholds, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5% in 97.5% O2). A brass probe with a surface temperature clamped at 52.5 C (±0.1°C) was applied, pressure between the dorsum of the hind paw and the probe was maintained with a 9 g sand pouch for 40s ( Summer et al., 2006 ; Summer et al., 2007a ). Baseline mechanical threshold testing was performed 24 h after burn injury.  Mechanical nociceptive threshold Mechanical nociceptive thresholds were evaluated by the Randall-Sellito paw withdrawal test (Ugo-Basile® algesymeter, Stoelting, Chicago, IL) as described previously ( Aley and Levine, 2001 ; Aley et al., 2001 ). The experiments were not run in a blinded manner. Baseline mechanical thresholds were recorded as the mean of 3 measurements (at 10-min intervals) before pharmacological reagents. As a negative control, we verified that the injection of 10% DMSO in rat hind paw had no effect on paw-withdrawal threshold ( Fig. 7A ). PGE2 and 5-HT (100 ng each/2.5 ?l), 4?-PDD or GsMTx-4 were injected intradermally 30 min before behavioral testing. For statistical analysis, each paw was considered to be an independent observation.  Flinch test in rats As described previously ( Zheng and Chen, 2001 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ; Zhang et al., 2003 ; Houck et al., 2004 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2008 ), rats were acclimated in a clear plastic observation chamber for 30 min. Then they were briefly restrained while 10 ?l hypotonic solution (deionized water, 17 mOsm) was administered intradermally into the dorsum of the hind paw via a 30-gauge needle connected to a 100-?l syringe by polyethylene tubing. Rats were observed immediately after the injection for a 5-min period and the number of flinches observed was recorded as the flinch score. PGE2 and 5-HT (100 ng each/2.5 ?l), 4-?PDD or GsMTx-4 were injected intradermally 45 min before administration of the hypotonic stimulus at the same site of injection. For the experiments testing the recovery from the acute effect of GsMTx-4, flinching and mechanical thresholds were measured 24 hr after the injection of the drugs. For the experiments testing the recovery from the ODN treatment, flinching and mechanical thresholds were measured 4 days after the last ODN injection; we previously showed that this time frame was compatible with recovery of the expression level of TRPV4 protein ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2004 ). A control group of rats was run in parallel to confirm that repeated testing did not affect the mechanical nociceptive threshold or the number of flinches in response to intradermal injection of a hypotonic solution (data not shown).  Oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) preparation and administration The TRPC1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) sequence 5?-TTCTCCTCCTTCACCTCTCG-3? and the TRPC6 antisense ODN sequence 5?-ATAGTCCTGGCTCTCGTTGC-3? (Invitrogen Life technologies), were directed against a unique region of the rat TRPC1 or TRPC6 channels (GeneBank accession number, respectively, NM-053558 and NM-053559). The mismatch ODN sequence was designed by mismatching 7 and 8 bases (denoted by bold face) of the TRPC1 antisense (5?- AA CTCCT GG TTCA G C AG TCG -3?) and TRPC6 antisense (5?- TATC TCCT C GCTCTC CAA GC-3?), respectively. ODN was reconstituted in nuclease-free 0.9% NaCl (10 ?g/?l) and was administered into the spinal intrathecal space at a dose of 40 ?g/20 ?l, once a day for 3 days. For this procedure rats were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane (97.5% O2), a 30-gauge needle was inserted into the subarachnoid space on the midline between L4 and L5 vertebrae, and ODN was injected at 1 ?l/sec by micro-syringe ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ).  Antibodies The monoclonal anti-TRPC1 [EP1417Y] antibody (ab51255) generated in rabbit against the epitope KFHDFADRKDWDAFC, corresponding to residues 496-509 of human TRPC1 (Accession # I38361) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). To verify the specificity of this antibody, we tested in parallel the anti-TRPC1 antibody from Alomone Labs (ACC-010), the selectivity of which has been demonstrated ( Kim et al., 2003 ; Liu et al., 2008 ). In addition, we could show a significant decrease in the level of TRPC1 protein after treatment with TRPC1 antisense ODN while the level of TRPC1 protein was not affected by treatment with TRPC6 antisense ODN (data not shown). The polyclonal anti-TRPC6 antibody (ACC-017) generated in rabbits against the epitope RRNESQDYLLMDELG, corresponding to residues 24-38 of mouse TRPC6 (Accession # Q61143), was purchased from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem). The selectivity of this antibody has been previously shown ( Strubing et al., 2003 ; Dalrymple et al., 2004 ; Kress et al., 2008 ; Liu et al., 2008 ). We confirmed the specificity of this antibody by testing in parallel the anti-TRPC6 antibody from Abcam (ab47679). Furthermore, we could show a significant decrease in the level of TRPC6 protein after treatment with TRPC6 antisense ODN while the level of TRPC6 protein remained unaffected by treatment with TRPC1 antisense ODN (data not shown).  Western blot To confirm that the reduction in the nociceptive behaviors associated with ODN treatment resulted from a decrease in the level of TRPC1 and TRPC6 protein, lumbar DRG neurons (L5-L6) from ODN-treated rats were harvested 24 h after the last ODN injection. Membrane protein preparation and Western blot analyses were performed as previously described ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ). Briefly, protein concentration for each sample was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method using the MICRO BCA protein Assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology); proteins were loaded on a polyacrylamide gel (30 ?g/lane) and separated by electrophoresis. The membrane was probed with affinity-purified anti-TRPC1 (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or anti-TRPC6 antibody (1:500, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (HRP) goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000, Pierce Biotechnology). To normalize the loaded samples, affinity purified mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:5,000, Abcam) was used, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000, Pierce Biotechnology). Membranes were incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce Biotechnology) and images of the membrane were acquired with the CHEMILMAGER™ chemiluminescence imaging system and analyzed with AlphaEaseFC™ software (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). The density of the band of interest (TRPC1 or TRPC6) was measured and normalized to the density of the band of GAPDH. The percentage decrease in level of expression of the protein was then calculated using the formula; ((average of normalized density for antisense - average of normalized density for mismatch)/average of normalized density for mismatch) * 100. The SEM was calculated with the following formula: (SEM of average of normalized density for antisense/average of normalized density for mismatch) *100.  DRG membrane preparation, subcellular fractionation Lumbar DRG (L4-L6) neurons isolated from adult male rats and cultured for 2 days were stimulated with a hypotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT (10 ?M each) for 15 min. Cells were then homogenized in homogenization buffer (10 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, 0.320 M sucrose and complete cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), pH=7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was placed on ice and the pellet resuspended in homogenization buffer. This step was repeated twice. Then, supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 15000 g for 25 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 5 mM Tris-HCl, 0.320 M sucrose and cocktail of proteases inhibitors (pH=8.1), layered on 5 mM Tris-HCl solution containing 1.2 M sucrose and centrifuged at 35000 g for 1 h at 4°C. The membrane fraction was diluted to a final sucrose concentration less than 0.3 M and centrifuged at 20000 g for 90 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was estimated by spectrophotometry at 280 nm. Protein samples were separated on a polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel and Western blot analysis was performed. The membrane was probed in parallel with affinity-purified anti-TRPC1 (1:500, Abcam), anti-TRPC6 antibody (1:500, Alomone Labs) or anti-TRPV4 (1:500, Alomone Labs) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (HRP) goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000, Pierce Biotechnology).  In vivo single fiber electrophysiology Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (initially 50 mg/kg, i.p ), with additional doses given throughout the experiment to maintain areflexia. Single C-fibers from the saphenous nerve, with cutaneous receptive fields, were recorded as described previously ( Chen and Levine, 1999 ). Briefly, recordings were made from the saphenous nerve, which innervates the medial–dorsal surface of the hind paw. Bipolar stimulating electrodes were placed under the nerve at a site distal to the recording site. The nerve was crushed proximal to the recording site to prevent flexor reflexes during electrical stimulation of the nerve. Fine fascicles of axons were dissected from the nerve and placed on a silver-wire recording electrode. Single units were first detected by electrical stimulation of the nerve. The conduction velocity of a fiber was determined by dividing the distance between the stimulating and recording electrodes by the action potential latency. Fibers with conduction velocities less than 2 m/sec were classified as C-fibers ( Willis, 1985 ). The action potential corresponding to the C-fiber whose receptive field had been identified was determined by the latency delay technique, in which electrically evoked spikes resulted in longer latency when the receptive field of the same fiber was stimulated ( Handwerker et al., 1991 ). Receptive fields of individual C-fibers were located and measured using a mechanical search stimulus. The fiber was determined as cutaneous if it was activated by lifting and stimulating the skin and/or if the receptive fields move when the skin is moved relative to subcutaneous tissue. Non-cutaneous fibers were not further studied. Spontaneous activity of C-fibers was measured as the number of action potentials fired during a 2-min period, in the absence of applied stimulation. Mechanical threshold was determined with calibrated von Frey hairs (Ainsworth, London, UK) and defined as the lowest force that elicited two or more spikes within 1 sec, in at least 6 of 10 trials. Sustained (60 sec) suprathreshold (10 g) mechanical stimulation was performed using a mechanical stimulator consisting of a force-measuring transducer (Entran, Fairfield, NJ) mounted in series with interchangeable VFH filaments. Once the receptive field was delimited and the response to mechanical stimulus characterized GsMTx-4 (1000 ng in 2.5 ?l) or the simplified soup (PGE2 and 5-HT, 100 ng each in a final volume of 2.5 ?l) were injected intradermally approximately 1 mm from the center of a C-fiber's mechanical receptive field.  Dorsal root ganglion cell culture L2-L6 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were harvested from TRPV4+/+ and TRPV4-/- mice and dissociated and cultured as described previously ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ). Briefly, dissociated cells were plated on cover slips treated with poly-DL-ornithine (0.1 mg/ml; Sigma, St Louis, MO) and laminin (5 ?g/ml; Invitrogen) and incubated at 37°C in 96.5% air, 3.5% CO2. Neurons were maintained in culture for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 50-100 ng/ml nerve growth factor, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, MEM vitamins and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (all from Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).  Calcium imaging Calcium imaging was performed using the fluorescent calcium indicator fura 2-acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2AM) 48 h after dissociation, as described previously ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ). Briefly, neurons were loaded with 5-?M fura-2 AM for 20 min in isotonic solution (312 mOsm). Experiments were carried out at 20-23°C with the perfusion at a flow rate of 1-2 ml/min. Cells were perfused with isotonic solution for 10 min before recordings to allow complete removal of un-hydrolysed fura-ester. Measurement of the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca2+]i) was performed by ratiometric imaging with an intensified charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Fluorescence was excited at 340 and 380 nm and emitted light was long-filtered at 510 nm. The fluorescence ratio, F340/F380, was calculated with METAFLUOR® software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). Calcium calibration was performed with a Fura-2 calcium imaging calibration kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and apparent free [Ca2+]i was calculated from the equation [Ca2+]i= Kd × ((R-Rmin)/(Rmax-R)) × (F380max/F380min) where R is the ratio of 510 nm emission intensity, exciting at 340 nm, to 510 nm emission intensity, exciting at 380 nm; Rmin is the ratio at zero free Ca2+; Rmax is the ratio at saturating Ca2+ (e.g., 39 ?M); F380 max is the fluorescence intensity, exciting at 380 nm, for zero free Ca2+; and F380 min is the fluorescence intensity at saturating free Ca2+. The Kd can be determined from the fura-2-containing Ca2+ standards and was calculated by using the utility available on the manufacturer website. The free Ca2+ for any experimental sample was then calculated from the corresponding R value. Neurons were challenged for 3 min with a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT (10 ?M each), washed for 10 min with isotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT, perfused with an isotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 (500 nM) for 5 min and then challenged with 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 for 3 min. Free Ca2+ was calculated from the normalized fluorescence ratio during a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 divided by the normalized fluorescence ratio in 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT. We minimized conductance via other ion channels than TRPV4 by employing a combination of room temperature, HEPES buffer, and variation of osmolarity only by modifying D-mannitol concentration ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ). Thus, the standard isotonic solution (312 mOsm) contained (in mM): 88 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2.4 CaCl2, 110 D-mannitol, 10 HEPES, and was buffered at pH 7.4 with NaOH. The hypotonic solution was adjusted to 212 mOsm (30% hypotonic) by lowering the amount of D-mannitol to 10 mM. Osmolarity and pH were measured before each experiment. The vehicle for the fura-2 AM, DMSO, at its final working dilution did not induce any response in DRG neurons (data not shown). At the end of each experiment, a short exposure to solution containing 20 mM KCl was performed to confirm that all cells studied exhibited electrical excitability that is typical of healthy neurons.  Single-cell RT-PCR Single-cell RT-PCR experiments were conducted as described previously ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ). Briefly, cytoplasm was aspirated into patch clamp electrodes from cultured DRG neurons and reverse transcription performed immediately using cells-to-cDNA™ II kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA). Two successive PCR amplifications were performed for 28 and 38 cycles using HotStar™ Taq Plus DNA Polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The following primer pairs were used for TRPV4 (accession number: NM_022017, nucleotides 1480-1700), TRPC1 (accession number: NM_011643, nucleotides 1843-2010) and TRPC6 (accession number: NM_013838, nucleotides 1417-1644). Gels were analysed with AlphaEaseFC™ software (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA).  Data analysis Group data are presented as mean±SEM and comparisons between groups performed by Student's t -test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) which, if significant, was followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons post hoc test. Significance was defined as a P-value ?0.05.  Results GsMTx-4 reverses mechanical hyperalgesia induced by inflammatory soup or carrageenan Intradermal injection of the SAC inhibitor GsMTx-4 up to a dose of 1000 ng did not affect the baseline mechanical nociceptive threshold ( Fig. 1A , white bars). In contrast, 1000 ng GsMTx-4 reversed the decrease in mechanical threshold induced by intradermal injection of inflammatory soup (PGE2, bradykinin, substance P, 5-HT and histamine, 100 ng each) in rat hind paw ( Fig. 1B , white bars). Inflammatory soup sensitizes primary afferent nociceptors by binding to numerous receptors and modulating ion channels (For review, ( Millan, 1999 )). We recently demonstrated that while single inflammatory mediators are insufficient, a simplified inflammatory soup consisting of PGE2 and 5-HT is sufficient to engage the mechanism of mechanotransduction that is dependent on TRPV4 ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). Therefore, we next tested whether GsMTx-4 (1000 ng) inhibits the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by intradermal injection of PGE2 and 5-HT (100 ng each). Co-injection of PGE2 and 5-HT induced a 37±2% decrease in mechanical threshold that was reversed by subsequent intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 at the same site ( Fig 2A , 116±2 g, n=12 for baseline, 72±1 g, n=12 after PGE2 and 5-HT and 116±2, n=6 after GsMTx-4, P <0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). We next assessed the contribution of SACs in a third model of inflammation induced by intradermal injection of carrageenan. The mechanical hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan was also reversed by subsequent injection of GsMTx-4 ( Fig. 2B , 118±1 g for baseline, 75±2 g after carrageenan and 113±3 g after GsMTx-4, n=8 for each group, P<0.0001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparisons test). Twenty four hours after administration of GsMTx-4, its effect was no longer detectable, the mechanical nociceptive threshold was not significantly different from its pre-GsMTx-4 value (n=8, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). A control group was run in parallel to confirm that repeated testing did not affect mechanical nociceptive threshold (data not shown). GsMTx-4 acts on <italic>sensitized</italic> primary afferent nociceptors To investigate whether GsMTx-4 acts on primary afferent nociceptors, we investigated the effect of intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 on the activity of single cutaneous C-fiber nociceptors from the saphenous nerve, in vivo. None of the fibers showed spontaneous activity. Intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 (1000 ng in 2.5 ?l) did not elicit activity in C-fibers ( Fig. 3A , n=13). Also, GsMTx-4 did not induce any significant change in the average time course of the response of C-fibers to a 60 sec application of a suprathreshold (10 g) mechanical stimulus (data not shown) nor affect the mechanical threshold of these fibers ( Fig. 3A inset, n=13, P>0.05, paired Student's t -test). We next investigated the effect of GsMTx-4 on the response to mechanical stimuli of sensitized cutaneous C-fibers. Exposure to simplified inflammatory soup (PGE2 and 5-HT, 100 ng each) induced a decrease in mechanical threshold in 15 out of 26 C-fibers tested ( Fig. 3B , p<0.0003, paired Student's t -test). Subsequent intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 reversed the decrease in mechanical threshold in 50% of sensitized C-fibers ( Fig. 3B , p<0.05, ?2 test with Yates correction). To further characterize the subpopulation of sensitized C-fibers that was sensitive to GsMTx-4, we compared the mechanical threshold, conduction velocity and the number of spikes per minute in response to a sustained mechanical stimulus to those in sensitized C-fibers that were GsMTx-4-insensitive. Based on these criteria, there was no difference between GsMTx-4-sensitive and GsMTx-4-insensitive sensitized C-fibers ( Fig. 3B, 3C and 3D , all P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Taken together with the behavioral experiments, these results suggest that GsMTx-4 inhibits SACs that contribute to mechanical hyperalgesia. GsMTx-4 reverses paclitaxel-induced mechanical hyperalgesia To determine whether SACs also contribute to mechanical hyperalgesia associated with models of painful peripheral neuropathy, we tested the effect of GsMTx-4 on the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel. Rats treated with paclitaxel (daily for 10 days) develop mechanical hyperalgesia ( Fig. 4 , 118±2 g, n=12 before and 74±3 g, n=6 after paclitaxel) that lasts for approximately 2 weeks ( Dina et al., 2001 ). Intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 in the hind paw 30 min before testing mechanical nociceptive threshold reversed mechanical hyperalgesia induced by paclitaxel ( Fig. 4 , 74±3 g before and 116±2 g after GsMTx-4, n=6 for each group, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). The effect of GsMTx-4 was reversible, 24 h after its administration mechanical nociceptive thresholds were not significantly different from pre-GsMTx-4 paw withdrawal thresholds ( Fig. 4 , n=6 for each group, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). GsMTx-4 also markedly reduces the sensitization to hypotonic stimuli GsMTx-4 inhibits the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by combinations of inflammatory mediators, carrageenan and paclitaxel to the same extent as spinal intrathecal administration of oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) antisense to TRPV4 ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2004 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). Moreover, we demonstrated in different models of inflammation or neuropathy that nocifensive behavior in response to mechanical stimulation (as the total number of paw withdrawals in response to repeated applications of a von Frey hair in the mice and by the Randall-Sellito paw withdrawal test in the rat) or intradermal injection of hypotonic solution (as the time of licking and shaking of the paw in the mice and the number of flinches in the rat) is absent in rats treated with repetitive intrathecal injection of antisense ODN for TRPV4, which transiently downregulates the level of expression of TRPV4 protein, or in TRPV4 knock down mice ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2005 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2008 ). Therefore, to further investigate the effect of GsMTx-4 on TRPV4-dependent nociceptive behavior, we tested whether GsMTx-4 reduces the number of nociceptive flinches in response to a hypotonic solution. Rats treated with inflammatory soup, carrageenan and paclitaxel have, respectively, a 4-, 3.6- and 3.2-fold increase in the number of nociceptive flinches in response to an injection of hypotonic solution (10 ?l of deionized water, 17 mOsm) in the hind paw compared to naive rats ( Fig. 5A , 4±1, n=12 in naive rats; 16±2, n=12 after inflammatory soup; 17±1, n=12 in carrageenan-treated rats and 13±2, n=10 in paclitaxel-treated rats, all P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). As shown in Figure 5A , treatment with GsMTx-4 reversed the increase in the number of flinches in response to hypotonicity induced by PGE2 and 5-HT, carrageenan or paclitaxel. Of note, there was no significant difference in the number of flinches between the groups treated with GsMTx-4 and the baseline number of flinches in naïve rats ( Fig. 5A , all P>0.05, Tukey's multiple comparison test). Again, the effect of the inhibitor was no longer present 24 h after its administration (P>0.05, Tukey's multiple comparison test). Of note, a control group was run in parallel to confirm that repeated testing did not affect the number of flinches in response to intradermal injection of hypotonic solution (data not shown). We also demonstrated that TRPV4 functions as an osmotransducer in DRG neurons in vitro ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ). Moreover, we showed that the increase in concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca2+]i) induced by a 30% hypotonic challenge is significantly enhanced in the presence of inflammatory soup in neurons from TRPV4+/+ mice but not in neurons from TRPV4-/- mice ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). To further investigate the effect of GsMTx-4 on TRPV4-dependent osmotransduction, we tested the effect of GsMTx-4 on the response of DRG neurons to hypotonic solution in the presence of inflammatory mediators, in vitro . Small-diameter DRG neurons (?25 ?m) isolated from TRPV4+/+ and TRPV4-/- mice were first challenged with a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT (212 mOsm, 10 ?M each) for 3 min and the perfusion was switched to an isotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT (312 mOsm) for 10 min. Then the neurons were perfused with isotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 (500 nM) for 5 min and challenged with a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 for 3 min. GsMTx-4 caused a decrease in the hypotonicity-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in both TRPV4 genotypes ( Fig. 5B , P<0.05, paired Student's t -test). TRPC1 and TRPC6 also contribute to hyperalgesia for mechanical and hypotonic stimuli GsMTx-4 inhibits TRPC1 and TRPC6 ( Spassova et al., 2006 ; Bowman et al., 2007 ), two members of the canonical subfamily of TRP channels. TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels respond to mechanical and hypotonic stimuli in non-neuronal cells ( Maroto et al., 2005 ; Spassova et al., 2006 ) and are present in DRG neurons ( Elg et al., 2007 ; Kress et al., 2008 ). Thus, we investigated whether TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 are co-expressed in DRG neurons. We harvested the cytoplasm of 47 DRG neurons and ran multiplex single-cell RT-PCR. Out of the 47 neurons tested, 14 did not express any of the 3 candidates. Out of the remaining 33 neurons, 16 co-expressed TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 while the other 17 expressed either 1 or 2 ( Fig. 5C ). Since level of mRNAs do not reflect the level of protein in the plasma membrane, we tested whether we could detect TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 in membrane fractions isolated from cultured lumbar DRG neurons by Western blot analysis. On day 2 in culture, neurons were homogenized and membrane fractions were isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Proteins were then separated on an electrophoresis gel and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 5D , we detected the expected bands at 120 and 110 kDa for TRPC1 and TRPC6 respectively, as well as the expected doublet bands at 98 and 107 kDa for TRPV4. This result was reproducible in 3 independent experiments. Next, to investigate the contribution of TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels to mechanotransduction, rats received spinal intrathecal administrations of antisense or mismatch ODN for TRPC1 or TRPC6, daily for 3 days. As shown in Figure 6A , TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense reversed the decrease in mechanical threshold induced by PGE2 and 5-HT compared to mismatch-ODN treated rats. The effect of the antisense was reversible, 4 d after the last ODN injection the mechanical paw withdrawal threshold was not significantly different from the pre-ODN baseline ( Fig. 6A , P>0.05, n=6 for each ODN group and n=18 for baseline, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). TRPC1 and TRPC6 antisense did not affect baseline nociceptive mechanical threshold, there was no significant difference between the groups of rats treated with ODNs and untreated control rats ( Fig. 6A , P>0.05, n=6 for each ODN group and n=24 for baseline, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). To further test for a role of TRPC1 and TRPC6 in the hyperalgesia induced by inflammatory mediators, we evaluated whether TRPC1- and TRPC6-antisense treatment reduces the number of flinches in response to hypotonicity. As shown in Figure 6B , treatment with TRPC1 and TRPC6 antisense reduced the number of flinches in inflammatory soup-treated rats by 71% and 56%, respectively, compared to mismatch treatment (n=6 for all groups, P<0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Again, the effect of TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense treatment was reversible, 4 d after the last injection of ODN the number of flinches in response to hypotonicity was similar to the pre-ODN baseline (n=6 for all groups, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Treatment with TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense markedly reduces the enhanced nociceptive behaviors to mechanical and hypotonic stimuli in the presence of inflammatory soup, to the same extent as treatment with TRPV4 antisense ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). Moreover, like TRPV4, while TRPC1 and TRPC6 make no apparent contribution to baseline mechanical thresholds, they participate in mechanical hyperalgesia. These results suggest that TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels function with TRPV4 to produce mechanical hyperalgesia. To further investigate a possible functional interaction among these 3 TRP channels, we tested the effect of antisense to TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 on a model of inflammation with a very different etiology, thermal burn injury. We recently demonstrated that a partial-thickness burn of less than one percent total body surface area on the dorsum of rat hind paw induces robust mechanical hyperalgesia that lasts up to 25 days ( Summer et al., 2006 ; Summer et al., 2007a ; Summer et al., 2007b ). Mechanical nociceptive thresholds were significantly decreased 24 h after the thermal injury ( Fig. 6C , 118±1 g before vs 74±1 g after thermal injury, n=36, P<0.0001, paired Student's t -test). As shown in Figure 6C , treatment with TRPV4 or TRPC6 antisense ODNs reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia compared to mismatch-treated rats (n=6 for all groups, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparisons test). In contrast, antisense ODNs to TRPC1 did not affect the thermal injury-induced mechanical hyperalgesia (n=36 for baseline and n=6 for both antisense and mismatch-treated, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). These results suggest that while TRPC1, TRPC6 and TRPV4 “cooperate” in the mechanism of mechanical hyperalgesia induced by intradermal injection of inflammatory mediators, the functional coupling between these 3 channels may depend on the etiology of the hyperalgesia. To confirm that the reduction in the nociceptive behaviors induced by TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense administration is associated with a decrease in the level of TRPC1 and TRPC6 protein, respectively, we performed Western blot analyses. Rats were treated with antisense- or mismatch-ODN for 3 d and on day 4, L5-L6 DRGs were harvested and processed for Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 6D , TRPC1 and TRPC6 antisense treatment caused a 37±4 % and 32±7% decrease, respectively, in the level of expression of TRPC1 and TRPC6 protein compared to mismatch-treated rats (n=3 for each group, p<0.05, unpaired Student's t -test). Treatment with TRPC6, but not TRPC1, antisense reverses 4?-PDD-induced hyperalgesia in primary afferent nociceptors The phorbol ester 4?-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4?-PDD), an inactive analog of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, activates TRPV4 by direct binding to a transmembrane region ( Watanabe et al., 2002 ; Vriens et al., 2007 ). Intradermal injection of 4?-PDD (1 ?g/2.5 ?l) in the hind paw, 30 min prior to mechanical testing, induced mechanical hyperalgesia ( Fig. 7A , 120±1 g, n=8 for baseline vs 76±1 g, n=8 after 4?-PDD, P<0.0001 paired Student's t -test). To determine whether TRPC1 and TRPC6 are necessary for TRPV4 function, we investigated whether treatment with TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense could inhibit the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by 4?-PDD. As shown in Figure 7B , TRPC6 antisense reversed 4?-PDD-induced mechanical hyperalgesia (76±1 g, n=8 for 4?-PDD baseline, 123±5 g, n=6 for antisense and 71±2 g, n=6 for mismatch-treated rats, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). In contrast, TRPC1 antisense did not significantly affect the decrease in nociceptive mechanical threshold induced by 4?-PDD ( Fig. 7B , P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Four days after the last ODN injection, the decrease in nociceptive mechanical threshold induced by 4?-PDD was not significantly different among TRPC6 ODN pre-treated rats and pre-ODN baseline (P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Next, we tested whether intradermal injection of 4?-PDD in rat hind paw induced nociceptive flinching. As shown in Figure 7C , 4?-PDD induces flinches (15±1, n=6). Moreover, 4?-PDD sensitizes nociceptors to the hypotonic stimulus; rats pre-treated with 4?-PDD have a 6-fold increase in the number of nociceptive flinches in response to an injection of hypotonic solution ( Fig. 7C , 4±1, n=12 for hypotonic in absence and 24±3, n=10 in presence of 4?-PDD, P<0.0001, unpaired Student's t -test). Treatment with TRPC6 antisense reduced the number of flinches induced by hypotonic solution in 4?-PDD-treated paws by 60% compared with mismatch ( Fig. 7C , 24±3, n=10 for 4?-PDD+Hypo, 8±1, n=6 for antisense- and 20±1, n=6 for mismatch-treated rats, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Again, the effect of TRPC6 antisense was reversible, 4 d after the last ODN injection there was no significant difference between the two groups of rats (P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the number of flinches in response to intradermal injection of hypotonic solution in presence of 4?-PDD between rats treated with TRPC1 antisense and TRPC1 mismatch ( Fig. 7C , n=10 for 4?-PDD+Hypo and n=6 for ODN groups, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). These results suggest that TRPC6 closely interacts with TRPV4 in primary afferent nociceptor sensitization.  Results GsMTx-4 reverses mechanical hyperalgesia induced by inflammatory soup or carrageenan Intradermal injection of the SAC inhibitor GsMTx-4 up to a dose of 1000 ng did not affect the baseline mechanical nociceptive threshold ( Fig. 1A , white bars). In contrast, 1000 ng GsMTx-4 reversed the decrease in mechanical threshold induced by intradermal injection of inflammatory soup (PGE2, bradykinin, substance P, 5-HT and histamine, 100 ng each) in rat hind paw ( Fig. 1B , white bars). Inflammatory soup sensitizes primary afferent nociceptors by binding to numerous receptors and modulating ion channels (For review, ( Millan, 1999 )). We recently demonstrated that while single inflammatory mediators are insufficient, a simplified inflammatory soup consisting of PGE2 and 5-HT is sufficient to engage the mechanism of mechanotransduction that is dependent on TRPV4 ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). Therefore, we next tested whether GsMTx-4 (1000 ng) inhibits the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by intradermal injection of PGE2 and 5-HT (100 ng each). Co-injection of PGE2 and 5-HT induced a 37±2% decrease in mechanical threshold that was reversed by subsequent intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 at the same site ( Fig 2A , 116±2 g, n=12 for baseline, 72±1 g, n=12 after PGE2 and 5-HT and 116±2, n=6 after GsMTx-4, P <0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). We next assessed the contribution of SACs in a third model of inflammation induced by intradermal injection of carrageenan. The mechanical hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan was also reversed by subsequent injection of GsMTx-4 ( Fig. 2B , 118±1 g for baseline, 75±2 g after carrageenan and 113±3 g after GsMTx-4, n=8 for each group, P<0.0001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparisons test). Twenty four hours after administration of GsMTx-4, its effect was no longer detectable, the mechanical nociceptive threshold was not significantly different from its pre-GsMTx-4 value (n=8, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). A control group was run in parallel to confirm that repeated testing did not affect mechanical nociceptive threshold (data not shown). GsMTx-4 acts on <italic>sensitized</italic> primary afferent nociceptors To investigate whether GsMTx-4 acts on primary afferent nociceptors, we investigated the effect of intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 on the activity of single cutaneous C-fiber nociceptors from the saphenous nerve, in vivo. None of the fibers showed spontaneous activity. Intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 (1000 ng in 2.5 ?l) did not elicit activity in C-fibers ( Fig. 3A , n=13). Also, GsMTx-4 did not induce any significant change in the average time course of the response of C-fibers to a 60 sec application of a suprathreshold (10 g) mechanical stimulus (data not shown) nor affect the mechanical threshold of these fibers ( Fig. 3A inset, n=13, P>0.05, paired Student's t -test). We next investigated the effect of GsMTx-4 on the response to mechanical stimuli of sensitized cutaneous C-fibers. Exposure to simplified inflammatory soup (PGE2 and 5-HT, 100 ng each) induced a decrease in mechanical threshold in 15 out of 26 C-fibers tested ( Fig. 3B , p<0.0003, paired Student's t -test). Subsequent intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 reversed the decrease in mechanical threshold in 50% of sensitized C-fibers ( Fig. 3B , p<0.05, ?2 test with Yates correction). To further characterize the subpopulation of sensitized C-fibers that was sensitive to GsMTx-4, we compared the mechanical threshold, conduction velocity and the number of spikes per minute in response to a sustained mechanical stimulus to those in sensitized C-fibers that were GsMTx-4-insensitive. Based on these criteria, there was no difference between GsMTx-4-sensitive and GsMTx-4-insensitive sensitized C-fibers ( Fig. 3B, 3C and 3D , all P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Taken together with the behavioral experiments, these results suggest that GsMTx-4 inhibits SACs that contribute to mechanical hyperalgesia. GsMTx-4 reverses paclitaxel-induced mechanical hyperalgesia To determine whether SACs also contribute to mechanical hyperalgesia associated with models of painful peripheral neuropathy, we tested the effect of GsMTx-4 on the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel. Rats treated with paclitaxel (daily for 10 days) develop mechanical hyperalgesia ( Fig. 4 , 118±2 g, n=12 before and 74±3 g, n=6 after paclitaxel) that lasts for approximately 2 weeks ( Dina et al., 2001 ). Intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 in the hind paw 30 min before testing mechanical nociceptive threshold reversed mechanical hyperalgesia induced by paclitaxel ( Fig. 4 , 74±3 g before and 116±2 g after GsMTx-4, n=6 for each group, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). The effect of GsMTx-4 was reversible, 24 h after its administration mechanical nociceptive thresholds were not significantly different from pre-GsMTx-4 paw withdrawal thresholds ( Fig. 4 , n=6 for each group, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). GsMTx-4 also markedly reduces the sensitization to hypotonic stimuli GsMTx-4 inhibits the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by combinations of inflammatory mediators, carrageenan and paclitaxel to the same extent as spinal intrathecal administration of oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) antisense to TRPV4 ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2004 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). Moreover, we demonstrated in different models of inflammation or neuropathy that nocifensive behavior in response to mechanical stimulation (as the total number of paw withdrawals in response to repeated applications of a von Frey hair in the mice and by the Randall-Sellito paw withdrawal test in the rat) or intradermal injection of hypotonic solution (as the time of licking and shaking of the paw in the mice and the number of flinches in the rat) is absent in rats treated with repetitive intrathecal injection of antisense ODN for TRPV4, which transiently downregulates the level of expression of TRPV4 protein, or in TRPV4 knock down mice ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2005 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2008 ). Therefore, to further investigate the effect of GsMTx-4 on TRPV4-dependent nociceptive behavior, we tested whether GsMTx-4 reduces the number of nociceptive flinches in response to a hypotonic solution. Rats treated with inflammatory soup, carrageenan and paclitaxel have, respectively, a 4-, 3.6- and 3.2-fold increase in the number of nociceptive flinches in response to an injection of hypotonic solution (10 ?l of deionized water, 17 mOsm) in the hind paw compared to naive rats ( Fig. 5A , 4±1, n=12 in naive rats; 16±2, n=12 after inflammatory soup; 17±1, n=12 in carrageenan-treated rats and 13±2, n=10 in paclitaxel-treated rats, all P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). As shown in Figure 5A , treatment with GsMTx-4 reversed the increase in the number of flinches in response to hypotonicity induced by PGE2 and 5-HT, carrageenan or paclitaxel. Of note, there was no significant difference in the number of flinches between the groups treated with GsMTx-4 and the baseline number of flinches in naïve rats ( Fig. 5A , all P>0.05, Tukey's multiple comparison test). Again, the effect of the inhibitor was no longer present 24 h after its administration (P>0.05, Tukey's multiple comparison test). Of note, a control group was run in parallel to confirm that repeated testing did not affect the number of flinches in response to intradermal injection of hypotonic solution (data not shown). We also demonstrated that TRPV4 functions as an osmotransducer in DRG neurons in vitro ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ). Moreover, we showed that the increase in concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca2+]i) induced by a 30% hypotonic challenge is significantly enhanced in the presence of inflammatory soup in neurons from TRPV4+/+ mice but not in neurons from TRPV4-/- mice ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). To further investigate the effect of GsMTx-4 on TRPV4-dependent osmotransduction, we tested the effect of GsMTx-4 on the response of DRG neurons to hypotonic solution in the presence of inflammatory mediators, in vitro . Small-diameter DRG neurons (?25 ?m) isolated from TRPV4+/+ and TRPV4-/- mice were first challenged with a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT (212 mOsm, 10 ?M each) for 3 min and the perfusion was switched to an isotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT (312 mOsm) for 10 min. Then the neurons were perfused with isotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 (500 nM) for 5 min and challenged with a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 for 3 min. GsMTx-4 caused a decrease in the hypotonicity-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in both TRPV4 genotypes ( Fig. 5B , P<0.05, paired Student's t -test). TRPC1 and TRPC6 also contribute to hyperalgesia for mechanical and hypotonic stimuli GsMTx-4 inhibits TRPC1 and TRPC6 ( Spassova et al., 2006 ; Bowman et al., 2007 ), two members of the canonical subfamily of TRP channels. TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels respond to mechanical and hypotonic stimuli in non-neuronal cells ( Maroto et al., 2005 ; Spassova et al., 2006 ) and are present in DRG neurons ( Elg et al., 2007 ; Kress et al., 2008 ). Thus, we investigated whether TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 are co-expressed in DRG neurons. We harvested the cytoplasm of 47 DRG neurons and ran multiplex single-cell RT-PCR. Out of the 47 neurons tested, 14 did not express any of the 3 candidates. Out of the remaining 33 neurons, 16 co-expressed TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 while the other 17 expressed either 1 or 2 ( Fig. 5C ). Since level of mRNAs do not reflect the level of protein in the plasma membrane, we tested whether we could detect TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 in membrane fractions isolated from cultured lumbar DRG neurons by Western blot analysis. On day 2 in culture, neurons were homogenized and membrane fractions were isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Proteins were then separated on an electrophoresis gel and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 5D , we detected the expected bands at 120 and 110 kDa for TRPC1 and TRPC6 respectively, as well as the expected doublet bands at 98 and 107 kDa for TRPV4. This result was reproducible in 3 independent experiments. Next, to investigate the contribution of TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels to mechanotransduction, rats received spinal intrathecal administrations of antisense or mismatch ODN for TRPC1 or TRPC6, daily for 3 days. As shown in Figure 6A , TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense reversed the decrease in mechanical threshold induced by PGE2 and 5-HT compared to mismatch-ODN treated rats. The effect of the antisense was reversible, 4 d after the last ODN injection the mechanical paw withdrawal threshold was not significantly different from the pre-ODN baseline ( Fig. 6A , P>0.05, n=6 for each ODN group and n=18 for baseline, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). TRPC1 and TRPC6 antisense did not affect baseline nociceptive mechanical threshold, there was no significant difference between the groups of rats treated with ODNs and untreated control rats ( Fig. 6A , P>0.05, n=6 for each ODN group and n=24 for baseline, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). To further test for a role of TRPC1 and TRPC6 in the hyperalgesia induced by inflammatory mediators, we evaluated whether TRPC1- and TRPC6-antisense treatment reduces the number of flinches in response to hypotonicity. As shown in Figure 6B , treatment with TRPC1 and TRPC6 antisense reduced the number of flinches in inflammatory soup-treated rats by 71% and 56%, respectively, compared to mismatch treatment (n=6 for all groups, P<0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Again, the effect of TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense treatment was reversible, 4 d after the last injection of ODN the number of flinches in response to hypotonicity was similar to the pre-ODN baseline (n=6 for all groups, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Treatment with TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense markedly reduces the enhanced nociceptive behaviors to mechanical and hypotonic stimuli in the presence of inflammatory soup, to the same extent as treatment with TRPV4 antisense ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). Moreover, like TRPV4, while TRPC1 and TRPC6 make no apparent contribution to baseline mechanical thresholds, they participate in mechanical hyperalgesia. These results suggest that TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels function with TRPV4 to produce mechanical hyperalgesia. To further investigate a possible functional interaction among these 3 TRP channels, we tested the effect of antisense to TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 on a model of inflammation with a very different etiology, thermal burn injury. We recently demonstrated that a partial-thickness burn of less than one percent total body surface area on the dorsum of rat hind paw induces robust mechanical hyperalgesia that lasts up to 25 days ( Summer et al., 2006 ; Summer et al., 2007a ; Summer et al., 2007b ). Mechanical nociceptive thresholds were significantly decreased 24 h after the thermal injury ( Fig. 6C , 118±1 g before vs 74±1 g after thermal injury, n=36, P<0.0001, paired Student's t -test). As shown in Figure 6C , treatment with TRPV4 or TRPC6 antisense ODNs reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia compared to mismatch-treated rats (n=6 for all groups, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparisons test). In contrast, antisense ODNs to TRPC1 did not affect the thermal injury-induced mechanical hyperalgesia (n=36 for baseline and n=6 for both antisense and mismatch-treated, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). These results suggest that while TRPC1, TRPC6 and TRPV4 “cooperate” in the mechanism of mechanical hyperalgesia induced by intradermal injection of inflammatory mediators, the functional coupling between these 3 channels may depend on the etiology of the hyperalgesia. To confirm that the reduction in the nociceptive behaviors induced by TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense administration is associated with a decrease in the level of TRPC1 and TRPC6 protein, respectively, we performed Western blot analyses. Rats were treated with antisense- or mismatch-ODN for 3 d and on day 4, L5-L6 DRGs were harvested and processed for Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 6D , TRPC1 and TRPC6 antisense treatment caused a 37±4 % and 32±7% decrease, respectively, in the level of expression of TRPC1 and TRPC6 protein compared to mismatch-treated rats (n=3 for each group, p<0.05, unpaired Student's t -test). Treatment with TRPC6, but not TRPC1, antisense reverses 4?-PDD-induced hyperalgesia in primary afferent nociceptors The phorbol ester 4?-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4?-PDD), an inactive analog of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, activates TRPV4 by direct binding to a transmembrane region ( Watanabe et al., 2002 ; Vriens et al., 2007 ). Intradermal injection of 4?-PDD (1 ?g/2.5 ?l) in the hind paw, 30 min prior to mechanical testing, induced mechanical hyperalgesia ( Fig. 7A , 120±1 g, n=8 for baseline vs 76±1 g, n=8 after 4?-PDD, P<0.0001 paired Student's t -test). To determine whether TRPC1 and TRPC6 are necessary for TRPV4 function, we investigated whether treatment with TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense could inhibit the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by 4?-PDD. As shown in Figure 7B , TRPC6 antisense reversed 4?-PDD-induced mechanical hyperalgesia (76±1 g, n=8 for 4?-PDD baseline, 123±5 g, n=6 for antisense and 71±2 g, n=6 for mismatch-treated rats, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). In contrast, TRPC1 antisense did not significantly affect the decrease in nociceptive mechanical threshold induced by 4?-PDD ( Fig. 7B , P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Four days after the last ODN injection, the decrease in nociceptive mechanical threshold induced by 4?-PDD was not significantly different among TRPC6 ODN pre-treated rats and pre-ODN baseline (P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Next, we tested whether intradermal injection of 4?-PDD in rat hind paw induced nociceptive flinching. As shown in Figure 7C , 4?-PDD induces flinches (15±1, n=6). Moreover, 4?-PDD sensitizes nociceptors to the hypotonic stimulus; rats pre-treated with 4?-PDD have a 6-fold increase in the number of nociceptive flinches in response to an injection of hypotonic solution ( Fig. 7C , 4±1, n=12 for hypotonic in absence and 24±3, n=10 in presence of 4?-PDD, P<0.0001, unpaired Student's t -test). Treatment with TRPC6 antisense reduced the number of flinches induced by hypotonic solution in 4?-PDD-treated paws by 60% compared with mismatch ( Fig. 7C , 24±3, n=10 for 4?-PDD+Hypo, 8±1, n=6 for antisense- and 20±1, n=6 for mismatch-treated rats, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Again, the effect of TRPC6 antisense was reversible, 4 d after the last ODN injection there was no significant difference between the two groups of rats (P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the number of flinches in response to intradermal injection of hypotonic solution in presence of 4?-PDD between rats treated with TRPC1 antisense and TRPC1 mismatch ( Fig. 7C , n=10 for 4?-PDD+Hypo and n=6 for ODN groups, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). These results suggest that TRPC6 closely interacts with TRPV4 in primary afferent nociceptor sensitization.  GsMTx-4 reverses mechanical hyperalgesia induced by inflammatory soup or carrageenan Intradermal injection of the SAC inhibitor GsMTx-4 up to a dose of 1000 ng did not affect the baseline mechanical nociceptive threshold ( Fig. 1A , white bars). In contrast, 1000 ng GsMTx-4 reversed the decrease in mechanical threshold induced by intradermal injection of inflammatory soup (PGE2, bradykinin, substance P, 5-HT and histamine, 100 ng each) in rat hind paw ( Fig. 1B , white bars). Inflammatory soup sensitizes primary afferent nociceptors by binding to numerous receptors and modulating ion channels (For review, ( Millan, 1999 )). We recently demonstrated that while single inflammatory mediators are insufficient, a simplified inflammatory soup consisting of PGE2 and 5-HT is sufficient to engage the mechanism of mechanotransduction that is dependent on TRPV4 ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). Therefore, we next tested whether GsMTx-4 (1000 ng) inhibits the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by intradermal injection of PGE2 and 5-HT (100 ng each). Co-injection of PGE2 and 5-HT induced a 37±2% decrease in mechanical threshold that was reversed by subsequent intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 at the same site ( Fig 2A , 116±2 g, n=12 for baseline, 72±1 g, n=12 after PGE2 and 5-HT and 116±2, n=6 after GsMTx-4, P <0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). We next assessed the contribution of SACs in a third model of inflammation induced by intradermal injection of carrageenan. The mechanical hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan was also reversed by subsequent injection of GsMTx-4 ( Fig. 2B , 118±1 g for baseline, 75±2 g after carrageenan and 113±3 g after GsMTx-4, n=8 for each group, P<0.0001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparisons test). Twenty four hours after administration of GsMTx-4, its effect was no longer detectable, the mechanical nociceptive threshold was not significantly different from its pre-GsMTx-4 value (n=8, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). A control group was run in parallel to confirm that repeated testing did not affect mechanical nociceptive threshold (data not shown).  GsMTx-4 reverses mechanical hyperalgesia induced by inflammatory soup or carrageenan Intradermal injection of the SAC inhibitor GsMTx-4 up to a dose of 1000 ng did not affect the baseline mechanical nociceptive threshold ( Fig. 1A , white bars). In contrast, 1000 ng GsMTx-4 reversed the decrease in mechanical threshold induced by intradermal injection of inflammatory soup (PGE2, bradykinin, substance P, 5-HT and histamine, 100 ng each) in rat hind paw ( Fig. 1B , white bars).

Co-injection of PGE2 and 5-HT induced a 37±2% decrease in mechanical threshold that was reversed by subsequent intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 at the same site ( Fig 2A , 116±2 g, n=12 for baseline, 72±1 g, n=12 after PGE2 and 5-HT and 116±2, n=6 after GsMTx-4, P <0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). We next assessed the contribution of SACs in a third model of inflammation induced by intradermal injection of carrageenan. The mechanical hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan was also reversed by subsequent injection of GsMTx-4 ( Fig. 2B , 118±1 g for baseline, 75±2 g after carrageenan and 113±3 g after GsMTx-4, n=8 for each group, P<0.0001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparisons test). Twenty four hours after administration of GsMTx-4, its effect was no longer detectable, the mechanical nociceptive threshold was not significantly different from its pre-GsMTx-4 value (n=8, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test).

GsMTx-4 acts on <italic>sensitized</italic> primary afferent nociceptors To investigate whether GsMTx-4 acts on primary afferent nociceptors, we investigated the effect of intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 on the activity of single cutaneous C-fiber nociceptors from the saphenous nerve, in vivo. None of the fibers showed spontaneous activity. Intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 (1000 ng in 2.5 ?l) did not elicit activity in C-fibers ( Fig. 3A , n=13). Also, GsMTx-4 did not induce any significant change in the average time course of the response of C-fibers to a 60 sec application of a suprathreshold (10 g) mechanical stimulus (data not shown) nor affect the mechanical threshold of these fibers ( Fig. 3A inset, n=13, P>0.05, paired Student's t -test). We next investigated the effect of GsMTx-4 on the response to mechanical stimuli of sensitized cutaneous C-fibers. Exposure to simplified inflammatory soup (PGE2 and 5-HT, 100 ng each) induced a decrease in mechanical threshold in 15 out of 26 C-fibers tested ( Fig. 3B , p<0.0003, paired Student's t -test). Subsequent intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 reversed the decrease in mechanical threshold in 50% of sensitized C-fibers ( Fig. 3B , p<0.05, ?2 test with Yates correction). To further characterize the subpopulation of sensitized C-fibers that was sensitive to GsMTx-4, we compared the mechanical threshold, conduction velocity and the number of spikes per minute in response to a sustained mechanical stimulus to those in sensitized C-fibers that were GsMTx-4-insensitive. Based on these criteria, there was no difference between GsMTx-4-sensitive and GsMTx-4-insensitive sensitized C-fibers ( Fig. 3B, 3C and 3D , all P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Taken together with the behavioral experiments, these results suggest that GsMTx-4 inhibits SACs that contribute to mechanical hyperalgesia.  GsMTx-4 acts on <italic>sensitized</italic> primary afferent nociceptors To investigate whether GsMTx-4 acts on primary afferent nociceptors, we investigated the effect of intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 on the activity of single cutaneous C-fiber nociceptors from the saphenous nerve, in vivo.

Based on these criteria, there was no difference between GsMTx-4-sensitive and GsMTx-4-insensitive sensitized C-fibers ( Fig. 3B, 3C and 3D , all P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Taken together with the behavioral experiments, these results suggest that GsMTx-4 inhibits SACs that contribute to mechanical hyperalgesia.  GsMTx-4 reverses paclitaxel-induced mechanical hyperalgesia To determine whether SACs also contribute to mechanical hyperalgesia associated with models of painful peripheral neuropathy, we tested the effect of GsMTx-4 on the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel. Rats treated with paclitaxel (daily for 10 days) develop mechanical hyperalgesia ( Fig. 4 , 118±2 g, n=12 before and 74±3 g, n=6 after paclitaxel) that lasts for approximately 2 weeks ( Dina et al., 2001 ). Intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 in the hind paw 30 min before testing mechanical nociceptive threshold reversed mechanical hyperalgesia induced by paclitaxel ( Fig. 4 , 74±3 g before and 116±2 g after GsMTx-4, n=6 for each group, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). The effect of GsMTx-4 was reversible, 24 h after its administration mechanical nociceptive thresholds were not significantly different from pre-GsMTx-4 paw withdrawal thresholds ( Fig. 4 , n=6 for each group, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test).  GsMTx-4 reverses paclitaxel-induced mechanical hyperalgesia To determine whether SACs also contribute to mechanical hyperalgesia associated with models of painful peripheral neuropathy, we tested the effect of GsMTx-4 on the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel. Rats treated with paclitaxel (daily for 10 days) develop mechanical hyperalgesia ( Fig. 4 , 118±2 g, n=12 before and 74±3 g, n=6 after paclitaxel) that lasts for approximately 2 weeks ( Dina et al., 2001 ). Intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 in the hind paw 30 min before testing mechanical nociceptive threshold reversed mechanical hyperalgesia induced by paclitaxel ( Fig. 4 , 74±3 g before and 116±2 g after GsMTx-4, n=6 for each group, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). The effect of GsMTx-4 was reversible, 24 h after its administration mechanical nociceptive thresholds were not significantly different from pre-GsMTx-4 paw withdrawal thresholds ( Fig. 4 , n=6 for each group, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test).  GsMTx-4 also markedly reduces the sensitization to hypotonic stimuli GsMTx-4 inhibits the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by combinations of inflammatory mediators, carrageenan and paclitaxel to the same extent as spinal intrathecal administration of oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) antisense to TRPV4 ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2004 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). Moreover, we demonstrated in different models of inflammation or neuropathy that nocifensive behavior in response to mechanical stimulation (as the total number of paw withdrawals in response to repeated applications of a von Frey hair in the mice and by the Randall-Sellito paw withdrawal test in the rat) or intradermal injection of hypotonic solution (as the time of licking and shaking of the paw in the mice and the number of flinches in the rat) is absent in rats treated with repetitive intrathecal injection of antisense ODN for TRPV4, which transiently downregulates the level of expression of TRPV4 protein, or in TRPV4 knock down mice ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2005 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2008 ). Therefore, to further investigate the effect of GsMTx-4 on TRPV4-dependent nociceptive behavior, we tested whether GsMTx-4 reduces the number of nociceptive flinches in response to a hypotonic solution. Rats treated with inflammatory soup, carrageenan and paclitaxel have, respectively, a 4-, 3.6- and 3.2-fold increase in the number of nociceptive flinches in response to an injection of hypotonic solution (10 ?l of deionized water, 17 mOsm) in the hind paw compared to naive rats ( Fig. 5A , 4±1, n=12 in naive rats; 16±2, n=12 after inflammatory soup; 17±1, n=12 in carrageenan-treated rats and 13±2, n=10 in paclitaxel-treated rats, all P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). As shown in Figure 5A , treatment with GsMTx-4 reversed the increase in the number of flinches in response to hypotonicity induced by PGE2 and 5-HT, carrageenan or paclitaxel. Of note, there was no significant difference in the number of flinches between the groups treated with GsMTx-4 and the baseline number of flinches in naïve rats ( Fig. 5A , all P>0.05, Tukey's multiple comparison test). Again, the effect of the inhibitor was no longer present 24 h after its administration (P>0.05, Tukey's multiple comparison test). Of note, a control group was run in parallel to confirm that repeated testing did not affect the number of flinches in response to intradermal injection of hypotonic solution (data not shown). We also demonstrated that TRPV4 functions as an osmotransducer in DRG neurons in vitro ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ). Moreover, we showed that the increase in concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca2+]i) induced by a 30% hypotonic challenge is significantly enhanced in the presence of inflammatory soup in neurons from TRPV4+/+ mice but not in neurons from TRPV4-/- mice ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). To further investigate the effect of GsMTx-4 on TRPV4-dependent osmotransduction, we tested the effect of GsMTx-4 on the response of DRG neurons to hypotonic solution in the presence of inflammatory mediators, in vitro . Small-diameter DRG neurons (?25 ?m) isolated from TRPV4+/+ and TRPV4-/- mice were first challenged with a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT (212 mOsm, 10 ?M each) for 3 min and the perfusion was switched to an isotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT (312 mOsm) for 10 min. Then the neurons were perfused with isotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 (500 nM) for 5 min and challenged with a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 for 3 min. GsMTx-4 caused a decrease in the hypotonicity-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in both TRPV4 genotypes ( Fig. 5B , P<0.05, paired Student's t -test).  GsMTx-4 also markedly reduces the sensitization to hypotonic stimuli GsMTx-4 inhibits the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by combinations of inflammatory mediators, carrageenan and paclitaxel to the same extent as spinal intrathecal administration of oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) antisense to TRPV4 ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2004 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). Moreover, we demonstrated in different models of inflammation or neuropathy that nocifensive behavior in response to mechanical stimulation (as the total number of paw withdrawals in response to repeated applications of a von Frey hair in the mice and by the Randall-Sellito paw withdrawal test in the rat) or intradermal injection of hypotonic solution (as the time of licking and shaking of the paw in the mice and the number of flinches in the rat) is absent in rats treated with repetitive intrathecal injection of antisense ODN for TRPV4, which transiently downregulates the level of expression of TRPV4 protein, or in TRPV4 knock down mice ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2005 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2008 ). Therefore, to further investigate the effect of GsMTx-4 on TRPV4-dependent nociceptive behavior, we tested whether GsMTx-4 reduces the number of nociceptive flinches in response to a hypotonic solution. Rats treated with inflammatory soup, carrageenan and paclitaxel have, respectively, a 4-, 3.6- and 3.2-fold increase in the number of nociceptive flinches in response to an injection of hypotonic solution (10 ?l of deionized water, 17 mOsm) in the hind paw compared to naive rats ( Fig. 5A , 4±1, n=12 in naive rats; 16±2, n=12 after inflammatory soup; 17±1, n=12 in carrageenan-treated rats and 13±2, n=10 in paclitaxel-treated rats, all P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). As shown in Figure 5A , treatment with GsMTx-4 reversed the increase in the number of flinches in response to hypotonicity induced by PGE2 and 5-HT, carrageenan or paclitaxel. Of note, there was no significant difference in the number of flinches between the groups treated with GsMTx-4 and the baseline number of flinches in naïve rats ( Fig. 5A , all P>0.05, Tukey's multiple comparison test). Again, the effect of the inhibitor was no longer present 24 h after its administration (P>0.05, Tukey's multiple comparison test). Of note, a control group was run in parallel to confirm that repeated testing did not affect the number of flinches in response to intradermal injection of hypotonic solution (data not shown). We also demonstrated that TRPV4 functions as an osmotransducer in DRG neurons in vitro ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2003 ). Moreover, we showed that the increase in concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca2+]i) induced by a 30% hypotonic challenge is significantly enhanced in the presence of inflammatory soup in neurons from TRPV4+/+ mice but not in neurons from TRPV4-/- mice ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). To further investigate the effect of GsMTx-4 on TRPV4-dependent osmotransduction, we tested the effect of GsMTx-4 on the response of DRG neurons to hypotonic solution in the presence of inflammatory mediators, in vitro . Small-diameter DRG neurons (?25 ?m) isolated from TRPV4+/+ and TRPV4-/- mice were first challenged with a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT (212 mOsm, 10 ?M each) for 3 min and the perfusion was switched to an isotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT (312 mOsm) for 10 min. Then the neurons were perfused with isotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 (500 nM) for 5 min and challenged with a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 for 3 min. GsMTx-4 caused a decrease in the hypotonicity-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in both TRPV4 genotypes ( Fig. 5B , P<0.05, paired Student's t -test).  TRPC1 and TRPC6 also contribute to hyperalgesia for mechanical and hypotonic stimuli GsMTx-4 inhibits TRPC1 and TRPC6 ( Spassova et al., 2006 ; Bowman et al., 2007 ), two members of the canonical subfamily of TRP channels. TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels respond to mechanical and hypotonic stimuli in non-neuronal cells ( Maroto et al., 2005 ; Spassova et al., 2006 ) and are present in DRG neurons ( Elg et al., 2007 ; Kress et al., 2008 ). Thus, we investigated whether TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 are co-expressed in DRG neurons. We harvested the cytoplasm of 47 DRG neurons and ran multiplex single-cell RT-PCR. Out of the 47 neurons tested, 14 did not express any of the 3 candidates. Out of the remaining 33 neurons, 16 co-expressed TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 while the other 17 expressed either 1 or 2 ( Fig. 5C ). Since level of mRNAs do not reflect the level of protein in the plasma membrane, we tested whether we could detect TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 in membrane fractions isolated from cultured lumbar DRG neurons by Western blot analysis. On day 2 in culture, neurons were homogenized and membrane fractions were isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Proteins were then separated on an electrophoresis gel and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 5D , we detected the expected bands at 120 and 110 kDa for TRPC1 and TRPC6 respectively, as well as the expected doublet bands at 98 and 107 kDa for TRPV4. This result was reproducible in 3 independent experiments. Next, to investigate the contribution of TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels to mechanotransduction, rats received spinal intrathecal administrations of antisense or mismatch ODN for TRPC1 or TRPC6, daily for 3 days. As shown in Figure 6A , TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense reversed the decrease in mechanical threshold induced by PGE2 and 5-HT compared to mismatch-ODN treated rats. The effect of the antisense was reversible, 4 d after the last ODN injection the mechanical paw withdrawal threshold was not significantly different from the pre-ODN baseline ( Fig. 6A , P>0.05, n=6 for each ODN group and n=18 for baseline, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). TRPC1 and TRPC6 antisense did not affect baseline nociceptive mechanical threshold, there was no significant difference between the groups of rats treated with ODNs and untreated control rats ( Fig. 6A , P>0.05, n=6 for each ODN group and n=24 for baseline, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). To further test for a role of TRPC1 and TRPC6 in the hyperalgesia induced by inflammatory mediators, we evaluated whether TRPC1- and TRPC6-antisense treatment reduces the number of flinches in response to hypotonicity. As shown in Figure 6B , treatment with TRPC1 and TRPC6 antisense reduced the number of flinches in inflammatory soup-treated rats by 71% and 56%, respectively, compared to mismatch treatment (n=6 for all groups, P<0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Again, the effect of TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense treatment was reversible, 4 d after the last injection of ODN the number of flinches in response to hypotonicity was similar to the pre-ODN baseline (n=6 for all groups, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Treatment with TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense markedly reduces the enhanced nociceptive behaviors to mechanical and hypotonic stimuli in the presence of inflammatory soup, to the same extent as treatment with TRPV4 antisense ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). Moreover, like TRPV4, while TRPC1 and TRPC6 make no apparent contribution to baseline mechanical thresholds, they participate in mechanical hyperalgesia. These results suggest that TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels function with TRPV4 to produce mechanical hyperalgesia. To further investigate a possible functional interaction among these 3 TRP channels, we tested the effect of antisense to TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 on a model of inflammation with a very different etiology, thermal burn injury. We recently demonstrated that a partial-thickness burn of less than one percent total body surface area on the dorsum of rat hind paw induces robust mechanical hyperalgesia that lasts up to 25 days ( Summer et al., 2006 ; Summer et al., 2007a ; Summer et al., 2007b ). Mechanical nociceptive thresholds were significantly decreased 24 h after the thermal injury ( Fig. 6C , 118±1 g before vs 74±1 g after thermal injury, n=36, P<0.0001, paired Student's t -test). As shown in Figure 6C , treatment with TRPV4 or TRPC6 antisense ODNs reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia compared to mismatch-treated rats (n=6 for all groups, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparisons test). In contrast, antisense ODNs to TRPC1 did not affect the thermal injury-induced mechanical hyperalgesia (n=36 for baseline and n=6 for both antisense and mismatch-treated, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). These results suggest that while TRPC1, TRPC6 and TRPV4 “cooperate” in the mechanism of mechanical hyperalgesia induced by intradermal injection of inflammatory mediators, the functional coupling between these 3 channels may depend on the etiology of the hyperalgesia. To confirm that the reduction in the nociceptive behaviors induced by TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense administration is associated with a decrease in the level of TRPC1 and TRPC6 protein, respectively, we performed Western blot analyses. Rats were treated with antisense- or mismatch-ODN for 3 d and on day 4, L5-L6 DRGs were harvested and processed for Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 6D , TRPC1 and TRPC6 antisense treatment caused a 37±4 % and 32±7% decrease, respectively, in the level of expression of TRPC1 and TRPC6 protein compared to mismatch-treated rats (n=3 for each group, p<0.05, unpaired Student's t -test).  TRPC1 and TRPC6 also contribute to hyperalgesia for mechanical and hypotonic stimuli GsMTx-4 inhibits TRPC1 and TRPC6 ( Spassova et al., 2006 ; Bowman et al., 2007 ), two members of the canonical subfamily of TRP channels. TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels respond to mechanical and hypotonic stimuli in non-neuronal cells ( Maroto et al., 2005 ; Spassova et al., 2006 ) and are present in DRG neurons ( Elg et al., 2007 ; Kress et al., 2008 ).

The effect of the antisense was reversible, 4 d after the last ODN injection the mechanical paw withdrawal threshold was not significantly different from the pre-ODN baseline ( Fig. 6A , P>0.05, n=6 for each ODN group and n=18 for baseline, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). TRPC1 and TRPC6 antisense did not affect baseline nociceptive mechanical threshold, there was no significant difference between the groups of rats treated with ODNs and untreated control rats ( Fig. 6A , P>0.05, n=6 for each ODN group and n=24 for baseline, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). To further test for a role of TRPC1 and TRPC6 in the hyperalgesia induced by inflammatory mediators, we evaluated whether TRPC1- and TRPC6-antisense treatment reduces the number of flinches in response to hypotonicity. As shown in Figure 6B , treatment with TRPC1 and TRPC6 antisense reduced the number of flinches in inflammatory soup-treated rats by 71% and 56%, respectively, compared to mismatch treatment (n=6 for all groups, P<0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Again, the effect of TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense treatment was reversible, 4 d after the last injection of ODN the number of flinches in response to hypotonicity was similar to the pre-ODN baseline (n=6 for all groups, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Treatment with TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense markedly reduces the enhanced nociceptive behaviors to mechanical and hypotonic stimuli in the presence of inflammatory soup, to the same extent as treatment with TRPV4 antisense ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ).

Mechanical nociceptive thresholds were significantly decreased 24 h after the thermal injury ( Fig. 6C , 118±1 g before vs 74±1 g after thermal injury, n=36, P<0.0001, paired Student's t -test). As shown in Figure 6C , treatment with TRPV4 or TRPC6 antisense ODNs reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia compared to mismatch-treated rats (n=6 for all groups, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparisons test). In contrast, antisense ODNs to TRPC1 did not affect the thermal injury-induced mechanical hyperalgesia (n=36 for baseline and n=6 for both antisense and mismatch-treated, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). These results suggest that while TRPC1, TRPC6 and TRPV4 “cooperate” in the mechanism of mechanical hyperalgesia induced by intradermal injection of inflammatory mediators, the functional coupling between these 3 channels may depend on the etiology of the hyperalgesia. To confirm that the reduction in the nociceptive behaviors induced by TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense administration is associated with a decrease in the level of TRPC1 and TRPC6 protein, respectively, we performed Western blot analyses. Rats were treated with antisense- or mismatch-ODN for 3 d and on day 4, L5-L6 DRGs were harvested and processed for Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 6D , TRPC1 and TRPC6 antisense treatment caused a 37±4 % and 32±7% decrease, respectively, in the level of expression of TRPC1 and TRPC6 protein compared to mismatch-treated rats (n=3 for each group, p<0.05, unpaired Student's t -test).  Treatment with TRPC6, but not TRPC1, antisense reverses 4?-PDD-induced hyperalgesia in primary afferent nociceptors The phorbol ester 4?-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4?-PDD), an inactive analog of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, activates TRPV4 by direct binding to a transmembrane region ( Watanabe et al., 2002 ; Vriens et al., 2007 ). Intradermal injection of 4?-PDD (1 ?g/2.5 ?l) in the hind paw, 30 min prior to mechanical testing, induced mechanical hyperalgesia ( Fig. 7A , 120±1 g, n=8 for baseline vs 76±1 g, n=8 after 4?-PDD, P<0.0001 paired Student's t -test). To determine whether TRPC1 and TRPC6 are necessary for TRPV4 function, we investigated whether treatment with TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense could inhibit the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by 4?-PDD. As shown in Figure 7B , TRPC6 antisense reversed 4?-PDD-induced mechanical hyperalgesia (76±1 g, n=8 for 4?-PDD baseline, 123±5 g, n=6 for antisense and 71±2 g, n=6 for mismatch-treated rats, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). In contrast, TRPC1 antisense did not significantly affect the decrease in nociceptive mechanical threshold induced by 4?-PDD ( Fig. 7B , P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Four days after the last ODN injection, the decrease in nociceptive mechanical threshold induced by 4?-PDD was not significantly different among TRPC6 ODN pre-treated rats and pre-ODN baseline (P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Next, we tested whether intradermal injection of 4?-PDD in rat hind paw induced nociceptive flinching. As shown in Figure 7C , 4?-PDD induces flinches (15±1, n=6). Moreover, 4?-PDD sensitizes nociceptors to the hypotonic stimulus; rats pre-treated with 4?-PDD have a 6-fold increase in the number of nociceptive flinches in response to an injection of hypotonic solution ( Fig. 7C , 4±1, n=12 for hypotonic in absence and 24±3, n=10 in presence of 4?-PDD, P<0.0001, unpaired Student's t -test). Treatment with TRPC6 antisense reduced the number of flinches induced by hypotonic solution in 4?-PDD-treated paws by 60% compared with mismatch ( Fig. 7C , 24±3, n=10 for 4?-PDD+Hypo, 8±1, n=6 for antisense- and 20±1, n=6 for mismatch-treated rats, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Again, the effect of TRPC6 antisense was reversible, 4 d after the last ODN injection there was no significant difference between the two groups of rats (P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the number of flinches in response to intradermal injection of hypotonic solution in presence of 4?-PDD between rats treated with TRPC1 antisense and TRPC1 mismatch ( Fig. 7C , n=10 for 4?-PDD+Hypo and n=6 for ODN groups, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). These results suggest that TRPC6 closely interacts with TRPV4 in primary afferent nociceptor sensitization.  Treatment with TRPC6, but not TRPC1, antisense reverses 4?-PDD-induced hyperalgesia in primary afferent nociceptors The phorbol ester 4?-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4?-PDD), an inactive analog of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, activates TRPV4 by direct binding to a transmembrane region ( Watanabe et al., 2002 ; Vriens et al., 2007 ). Intradermal injection of 4?-PDD (1 ?g/2.5 ?l) in the hind paw, 30 min prior to mechanical testing, induced mechanical hyperalgesia ( Fig. 7A , 120±1 g, n=8 for baseline vs 76±1 g, n=8 after 4?-PDD, P<0.0001 paired Student's t -test). To determine whether TRPC1 and TRPC6 are necessary for TRPV4 function, we investigated whether treatment with TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense could inhibit the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by 4?-PDD. As shown in Figure 7B , TRPC6 antisense reversed 4?-PDD-induced mechanical hyperalgesia (76±1 g, n=8 for 4?-PDD baseline, 123±5 g, n=6 for antisense and 71±2 g, n=6 for mismatch-treated rats, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). In contrast, TRPC1 antisense did not significantly affect the decrease in nociceptive mechanical threshold induced by 4?-PDD ( Fig. 7B , P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Four days after the last ODN injection, the decrease in nociceptive mechanical threshold induced by 4?-PDD was not significantly different among TRPC6 ODN pre-treated rats and pre-ODN baseline (P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Next, we tested whether intradermal injection of 4?-PDD in rat hind paw induced nociceptive flinching. As shown in Figure 7C , 4?-PDD induces flinches (15±1, n=6). Moreover, 4?-PDD sensitizes nociceptors to the hypotonic stimulus; rats pre-treated with 4?-PDD have a 6-fold increase in the number of nociceptive flinches in response to an injection of hypotonic solution ( Fig. 7C , 4±1, n=12 for hypotonic in absence and 24±3, n=10 in presence of 4?-PDD, P<0.0001, unpaired Student's t -test). Treatment with TRPC6 antisense reduced the number of flinches induced by hypotonic solution in 4?-PDD-treated paws by 60% compared with mismatch ( Fig. 7C , 24±3, n=10 for 4?-PDD+Hypo, 8±1, n=6 for antisense- and 20±1, n=6 for mismatch-treated rats, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Again, the effect of TRPC6 antisense was reversible, 4 d after the last ODN injection there was no significant difference between the two groups of rats (P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the number of flinches in response to intradermal injection of hypotonic solution in presence of 4?-PDD between rats treated with TRPC1 antisense and TRPC1 mismatch ( Fig. 7C , n=10 for 4?-PDD+Hypo and n=6 for ODN groups, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). These results suggest that TRPC6 closely interacts with TRPV4 in primary afferent nociceptor sensitization.  Discussion We recently demonstrated that TRPV4 plays a fundamental role in mechanical hyperalgesia induced by diverse inflammatory and neuropathic agents that produce pain by various mechanisms of action ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2008 ). On the other hand, SACs contribute to the detection of mechanical stimuli in DRG neurons and can also be sensitized by hyperalgesic agents such as PGE2 ( McCarter et al., 1999 ; Cho et al., 2002 ; Hu and Lewin, 2006 ). Therefore, we investigated whether SACs may interact with TRPV4 to produce mechanical hyperalgesia by testing the selective SAC blocker GsMTx-4, on mechanical hyperalgesia associated with different models of inflammatory or neuropathic pain in the rat. We demonstrate that while intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 does not affect baseline nociceptive mechanical threshold in behavioral studies nor C-fiber threshold and responses to mechanical stimuli, it reverses mechanical hyperalgesia and markedly reduces the response of sensitized C-fiber primary afferents to mechanical stimuli. Park and colleagues (2008) reported an effect of GsMTx-4 on baseline nociceptive mechanical thresholds, however, they used a systemic intraperitoneal injection while we used a peripheral intradermal injection at the site of nociceptive testing, which restricts the action of GsMTx-4 to the peripheral terminal of the nociceptor. Moreover, GsMTx-4 inhibits the hyperalgesia for mechanical and hypotonic stimuli, induced by very different hyperalgesic agents (PGE2 and 5-HT, carrageenan and paclitaxel) and does it to the same extent as treatment with TRPV4 antisense ODN ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2004 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2008 ). GsMTx-4 has been shown to inhibit TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels ( Spassova et al., 2006 ; Bowman et al., 2007 ); both channels are strongly expressed in isolectin B4-positive DRG neurons ( Kress et al., 2008 ) and respond to both hypotonic and mechanical stimuli ( Maroto et al., 2005 ; Spassova et al., 2006 ). We demonstrate that antisense ODN for TRPC1 or TRPC6 reverses the hyperalgesia to hypotonic and mechanical stimuli induced by peripheral administration of PGE2 and 5-HT to the same extent as TRPV4 antisense ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). Of note, we recently demonstrated that intradermal injection of PGE2 and 5-HT does not induce hyperalgesia to hypotonic and mechanical stimuli in mice lacking a functional TRPV4 gene or in rats treated with TRPV4 antisense ODN ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2005 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). In addition, like TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 make no apparent contribution to baseline mechanical nociceptive threshold. Finally, TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 protein are detectable in membrane fractions of cultured DRG neurons and, while about 70% of cultured small-diameter neurons expressed at least one of the 3 TRPs, about half of these neurons (49%, 16 neurons out of 33 tested) co-express all three. Our findings suggest that these channels could functionally interact within sensitized sensory neurons to manifest mechanical hyperalgesia. Of note, these 3 channels are also expressed and functional in keratinocytes ( Chung et al., 2003 ; Chung et al., 2004 ; Cai et al., 2005 ; Cai et al., 2006 ) where they could interact to sensitize nociceptors indirectly. However, in the present study antisense to TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 were administered by spinal intrathecal injection; thus among the cells present in the skin, only sensory neurons are exposed to the ODN. Our results do not discriminate the nature of the interaction between TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 but they do suggest that while these channels cooperate in the development of mechanical hyperalgesia, they may have distinctive roles. TRPC6 and TRPV4 contribute to mechanical hyperalgesia of diverse etiology (i.e., PGE2 and 5-HT, thermal burn and 4?-PDD) while TRPC1 only contributes to that induced by PGE2 and 5-HT. The finding that treatment with TRPC6 antisense reverses the 4?-PDD-induced hyperalgesia to hypotonic and mechanical stimuli suggests that TRPC6 closely interacts with TRPV4 because 4?-PDD binds directly to transmembrane region 3 and 4 of the TRPV4 channel ( Vriens et al., 2007 ). Importantly, the interaction between TRPV4 and TRPC6 in sensitized nociceptors is specific to mechanical transduction because intraplantar injection of 4?-PDD induces mechanical hyperalgesia ( Grant et al., 2007 ) but not thermal hyperalgesia ( Souza et al., 2002 ). Interestingly, TRPV4 was recently shown to couple with another TRP channel, TRPP2 to form a polymodal sensory channel complex in cilia ( Kottgen et al., 2008 ). We suggest that TRPC6 may be similarly coupled to TRPV4, as a component of a molecular mechanotransduction complex comprising, but not limited to, TRPV4 channels, integrins and Src tyrosine kinases ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2008 ); of note, in this regard, members of the Src family kinase can also directly bind to TRPC6 and regulate its activity ( Hisatsune et al., 2004 ) and TRPC6 has been shown to participate in mechanotransduction in non neuronal cells ( Dietrich and Gudermann, 2007 ; Dietrich et al., 2007a ). Also, both TRPV4 and TRPC6 have been shown to interact with large conductance calcium-dependent potassium channels in non neuronal cells ( Fernandez-Fernandez et al., 2008 ; Kim et al., 2008 ). Whether TRPC6 can be directly activated by stretch remains controversial ( Maroto et al., 2005 ; Spassova et al., 2006 ; Dietrich et al., 2007b ; Gottlieb et al., 2008 ; Sharif-Naeini et al., 2008 ), and it was recently suggested that, in vascular smooth muscle cells, TRPC6 may not be primarily gated by membrane stretch but rather by an agonist-independent activation of Gq/11-coupled receptors that in turn activates protein G and phospholipase C pathways ( Mederos et al., 2008 ). A similar type of activation in primary nociceptors may be one mechanism by which TRPC6 contributes to mechanical hyperalgesia but not to baseline nociceptive mechanical thresholds. We also cannot rule out the existence of TRPV4 and TRPC6 heteromers. Further investigation is needed to understand the role of TRPC6 in the transduction of mechanical stimuli in sensitized nociceptors. TRPC channels can function as store-operated channels (SOCs) or receptor-operated channels (ROCs) through phospholipase C (PLC) activation and while TRPC6 has been shown to be activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) but not by internal calcium store depletion, several studies describe TRPC1 as a strong candidate for a SOC in neuronal cells ( Ambudkar and Ong, 2007 ; Rychkov and Barritt, 2007 ). TRPC1 has been shown to colocalize with calcium signaling proteins such as PLC, protein G?q/11, inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3R) and B2 bradykinin receptor ( Lockwich et al., 2000 ; Delmas et al., 2002 ; Yuan et al., 2003 ). Moreover, inflammatory mediators act on G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and TRPC channels can directly interact with GPCRs ( Ambudkar and Ong, 2007 ). Thus, TRPC1 might contribute in inflammatory soup-induced mechanical hyperalgesia as a SOC or a necessary accessory protein required for the activation of a SOC; the binding of PGE2 and 5HT to their respective G-protein-coupled receptors could initiate the activation of phospholipase C, the generation of IP3 and calcium release by IP3R which in turn activate TRPC1 ( Fig. 8 ). The IP3R has been shown to directly interact with TRPC1 ( Rychkov and Barritt, 2007 ) as well as TRPV4 ( Garcia-Elias et al., 2008 ). How TRPC1 interacts with TRPV4 and TRPC6 remains to be elucidated. However, the existence of heteromers and interactions with other molecules, such as cytoskeletal proteins, are likely to also participate in the mechanism of mechanical transduction. The presence of TRPC channels, some acting as SOCs others as ROCs, within the same cell ( Brechard et al., 2008 ), and their interaction with other TRP family members reflects not only the complexity of the TRP family of channels but also its physiological importance in nociceptor function. In conclusion, we demonstrate, for the first time, that while TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels do not contribute to baseline mechanical nociceptive threshold, they participate in the detection of mechanical stimuli in sensitized primary afferent nociceptors. We suggest that while TRPV4, TRPC6 and TRPC1 have distinctive roles, they “cooperate” in a mechanism mediating mechanical hyperalgesia and primary afferent nociceptor sensitization. Moreover, TRPC6 emerges like an attractive candidate as a component of signaling complexes, including TRPV4, integrins and Src tyrosine kinases, whose function is to transduce mechanical stimuli in the setting of inflammation or nerve injury.  Discussion We recently demonstrated that TRPV4 plays a fundamental role in mechanical hyperalgesia induced by diverse inflammatory and neuropathic agents that produce pain by various mechanisms of action ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2008 ). On the other hand, SACs contribute to the detection of mechanical stimuli in DRG neurons and can also be sensitized by hyperalgesic agents such as PGE2 ( McCarter et al., 1999 ; Cho et al., 2002 ; Hu and Lewin, 2006 ). Therefore, we investigated whether SACs may interact with TRPV4 to produce mechanical hyperalgesia by testing the selective SAC blocker GsMTx-4, on mechanical hyperalgesia associated with different models of inflammatory or neuropathic pain in the rat. We demonstrate that while intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 does not affect baseline nociceptive mechanical threshold in behavioral studies nor C-fiber threshold and responses to mechanical stimuli, it reverses mechanical hyperalgesia and markedly reduces the response of sensitized C-fiber primary afferents to mechanical stimuli. Park and colleagues (2008) reported an effect of GsMTx-4 on baseline nociceptive mechanical thresholds, however, they used a systemic intraperitoneal injection while we used a peripheral intradermal injection at the site of nociceptive testing, which restricts the action of GsMTx-4 to the peripheral terminal of the nociceptor. Moreover, GsMTx-4 inhibits the hyperalgesia for mechanical and hypotonic stimuli, induced by very different hyperalgesic agents (PGE2 and 5-HT, carrageenan and paclitaxel) and does it to the same extent as treatment with TRPV4 antisense ODN ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2004 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2008 ). GsMTx-4 has been shown to inhibit TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels ( Spassova et al., 2006 ; Bowman et al., 2007 ); both channels are strongly expressed in isolectin B4-positive DRG neurons ( Kress et al., 2008 ) and respond to both hypotonic and mechanical stimuli ( Maroto et al., 2005 ; Spassova et al., 2006 ). We demonstrate that antisense ODN for TRPC1 or TRPC6 reverses the hyperalgesia to hypotonic and mechanical stimuli induced by peripheral administration of PGE2 and 5-HT to the same extent as TRPV4 antisense ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). Of note, we recently demonstrated that intradermal injection of PGE2 and 5-HT does not induce hyperalgesia to hypotonic and mechanical stimuli in mice lacking a functional TRPV4 gene or in rats treated with TRPV4 antisense ODN ( Alessandri-Haber et al., 2005 ; Alessandri-Haber et al., 2006 ). In addition, like TRPV4, TRPC1 and TRPC6 make no apparent contribution to baseline mechanical nociceptive threshold.

Evaluation of nociceptive mechanical threshold in the absence (black bars) or presence (white bars) of different doses of GsMTx-4. Up to a dose of 1000 ng, GsMTx-4 did not affect baseline nociceptive mechanical threshold. B . Intradermal injection of a soup of inflammatory mediators (PGE2, 5-HT, histamine, substance P and bradykinin, 100 ng each) in rat hind paw induces a decrease in mechanical nociceptive threshold (black bar). Mechanical nociceptive threshold was evaluated 30 min after administration of different doses of GsMTx-4 (white bars; 10, 100 and 1000 ng). GsMTx-4 (1000 ng) reversed inflammatory soup-induced mechanical hyperalgesia. Figure 2 GsMTx-4 reverses mechanical hyperalgesia associated with inflammation A . Intradermal injection of the simplified inflammatory soup (PGE2 and 5-HT, 100 ng each) induces a decrease in mechanical threshold that was reversed by intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 (1000 ng) at the same site (116±2 g, n=12 for baseline and 72±1 g, n=12 after PGE2 and 5-HT and 116±2 g, n=6 after GsMTx-4, P <0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). B . Intradermal injection of carrageenan (1%, 5 ?l) in rat hind paw induces a significant decrease in mechanical nociceptive threshold that was reversed by intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 (1000 ng) at the same site (118±1 g for baseline, 75±2 g after carrageenan and 113±3 g after GsMTx-4, n=8, P <0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). The effect of GsMTx-4 is reversible, 24 hrs after its administration the decrease in mechanical threshold was not significantly different from pre-GsMTx-4 baseline (P >0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Figure 3 GsMTx-4 reverses the decrease in mechanical threshold induced by inflammatory soup in half of sensitized C-fibers A . Intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 (1000 ng, 2.5 ?l) adjacent to mechanical receptive fields did not induce significant activity in C-fibers. Inset; mechanical thresholds of C-fibers were not significantly different from baseline after intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 (n=13). B . Response of individual C-fibers to sustained (60-s) threshold mechanical stimulation before (?) and after (?) intradermal injection of PGE2 and 5-HT and after a subsequent intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 (?), “n” is the number of fibers recorded. Injection of simplified inflammatory soup (PGE2 and 5-HT, 100 ng each) into the mechanical receptive field of C-fibers reduced the mechanical threshold in 15 out of 26 C-fibers. A subsequent injection of GsMTx-4 (1000 ng, 2.5 ?l) into the C-fiber's mechanical receptive field reversed the decrease in mechanical thresholds induced by simplified soup in 50% of the sensitized C-fibers (8 out of 15). C . There is no significant difference in the conduction velocity between C-fibers that were soup-sensitive (n=15) vs soup-insensitive (n=11) nor between C-fibers that were GsMTx-4-sensitive or GsMTx-4-insensitive (p>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). D . Response of sensitized C-fibers to suprathreshold (10-g) mechanical stimulation before (?) and after (?) intradermal injection of PGE2 and 5-HT and after a subsequent intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 (?). There was no significant difference between C-fibers that were GsMTx-4-sensitive or GsMTx-4-insensitive. Figure 4 GsMTx-4 reverses paclitaxel chemotherapy-induced mechanical hyperalgesia Rats treated with paclitaxel (daily for 10 days) develop mechanical hyperalgesia (118±2 g, n=12 before and 74±3 g, n=6 after paclitaxel, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 in the hind paw 30 min before mechanical nociceptive threshold testing reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia (74±3 g before GsMTx-4 and 116±2 g after, n=6, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Twenty-four hours after the administration of GsMTx-4, mechanical nociceptive thresholds were not significantly different from pre-GsMTx-4 paw withdrawal thresholds (n=6 for each group, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Figure 5 GsMTx-4 also markedly reduces nociceptive flinching in response to hypotonic stimulation A . Rats treated with PGE2 and 5-HT, carrageenan or paclitaxel have, respectively a 4-, 3.6- and 3.2-fold increase in the number of nociceptive flinches in response to an intradermal injection of hypotonic solution (10 ?l of deionized water, 17 mOsm) compared to control rats. GsMTx-4 markedly reduced the number of flinches in PGE2 and 5-HT-treated (16±2, n=12 before and 8±1, n=6 after GsMTx-4), carrageenan-treated (17±1, n=12 before and 6±1, n=8 after GsMTx-4) and paclitaxel-treated (13±2, n=10 before and 7±1, n=6 after GsMTx-4) rats. All P<0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test. Twenty four hours after the administration of GsMTx-4, its effect was no longer present and there was no significant difference in the number of flinches between the different groups of rats (P>0.05, Tukey's multiple comparison test). B . Small-diameter (? 25?m) DRG neurons from TRPV4+/+ and TRPV4-/- were first challenged with a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT (10 ?M each) for 3 min and then challenged with a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 (500 nM) for 3 min. The increase in [Ca2+]i induced by the hypotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT is reduced in the presence of GsMTx-4 in TRPV4+/+ mice (2.4±0.2 ?M before and 1.7±0.2 ?M after GsMTx-4, n=24, P=0.007, paired Student's t -test) as well as in TRPV4-/- mice (1.7±0.1 ?M before and 1.4±0.1 ?M after GsMTx-4, n=14, P=0.03, paired Student's t -test). C . The cytoplasm of 47 DRG neurons was harvested after 2 d in culture and multiplex single-cell RT-PCR performed. Neurons expressed from none to all three of the mRNAs of interest; here we show the example of neurons expressing mRNA for TRPC1 (168 bp) or TRPC1 and TRPC6 (228 bp) or TRPC1, TRPC6 and TRPV4 (221 bp). D . Dissociated lumbar DRG neurons were cultured for 2 d. Cells were scraped in homogenization buffer and subcellular fractionation performed. The membrane fraction was separated on an electrophoresis gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was then probed in parallel with anti-TRPV4 (1:500), anti-TRPC1 (1:500) and anti-TRPC6 (1:500) antibodies. The expected bands at 120 kDa for TRPC1, 110 kDa for TRPC6 and the doublet bands at 98 and 107 kDa for TRPV4 were detected. Figure 6 Hyperalgesia to mechanical and hypotonic stimuli induced by PGE<sub>2</sub> and 5-HT is TRPC1 and TRPC6 dependent A . Treatment with TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense (AS) ODN for 3 days did not affect baseline nociceptive mechanical threshold in control rats (n=24 for baseline and n=6 for antisense and mismatch-treated rats, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). In contrast, the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by PGE2 and 5-HT was reversed by treatment with TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense compared to mismatch-treated (MM) rats (n= 18 for baseline and n=6 for antisense and mismatch-treated rats, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). The effect of the antisense was reversible, 4 d after the last ODN injection the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by PGE2 and 5-HT was not significantly different from pre-ODN baseline (P>0.05, Tukey's multiple-comparison test). B . Treatment with TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense also markedly reduced the number of flinches in response to intradermal injection of hypotonic solution in the presence of PGE2 and 5-HT, compared to mismatch-treated rats (n=6 for Hypo in presence of PGE2+5-HT and n=6 for each ODN group, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). C . Paw withdrawal thresholds were markedly decreased twenty-four hours after thermal injury (118±1 g before vs 74±1 g after thermal injury, n=36, P<0.0001, paired Student's t -test). Treatment with TRPV4 or TRPC6 antisense for 3 days markedly reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia compared with mismatch ODN-treated rats (n=6 for all groups). Again, the effect of the antisense treatment was reversible, there was no significant difference in the mechanical thresholds between baseline and ODN-treated groups 4 days after the last ODN injection (n=36 for baseline and n=6 for each ODN group, all P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). In contrast, TRPC1 antisense did not affect the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by thermal injury. D . There was a 37±4 % and a 32±7 % decrease in TRPC1 and TRPC6 protein expression level respectively (n=3 for all groups, P<0.05, unpaired student's t -test), in DRG of rats treated with antisense (AS) ODN compared with mismatch ODN-treated rats (MM). The amount of protein loaded in each lane was normalized by probing the membrane with an anti-GAPDH antibody. Figure 7 Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to TRPC6 reverses 4?-PDD-induced hyperalgesia to mechanical and hypotonic stimuli A . Intradermal injection of 4 ?-PDD (2.5 ?g/2.5 ?l) in rat hind paw 30 min before measurement of nociceptive thresholds induced a significant decrease in mechanical thresholds (120±1 g, n=8 for baseline vs 76±1 g, n=8 after 4?-PDD, P<0.0001, paired Student's t-t est). In contrast, intradermal injection of the vehicle, 10% DMSO had no significant effect on mechanical thresholds (n=4 before and after 10% DMSO, P>0.05, paired Student's t -test). B . Treatment with TRPC6 antisense ODN for 3 d reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by 4?-PDD compared to mismatch-treated rats (n=8 for baseline and n=6 for each ODN group, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). The effect of the antisense was reversible, 4 days after the last ODN injection the mechanical thresholds was similar in baseline and ODN-treated rats (P>0.05, Tukey's multiple-comparison test). In contrast, treatment with TRPC1 antisense ODN does not affect the decrease in mechanical threshold induced by 4?-PDD (P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). C . Intradermal injection of 4?-PDD in rat hind paw induces a significant number of flinches (15±1, n=6). Moreover, rats pre-treated with 4?-PDD have a 6-fold increase in the number of nociceptive flinches in response to an injection of hypotonic solution (4±1, n=12 for hypotonic in absence and 24±3, n=10 in presence of 4?-PDD, P<0.0001, unpaired Student's t -test). Treatment with TRPC6 antisense ODN markedly reduced the number of flinches induced by intradermal injection of hypo in presence of 4?-PDD compared to mismatch-treated rats (24±3, n=10 for baseline 4?-PDD+ Hypo, 8±1, n=6 for antisense- and 20±1, n=6 for mismatch-treated rats, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Again the effect of antisense was reversible; 4 d after the last ODN injection the number of flinches was no significantly different between TRPC6 antisense- and mismatch-treated rats. In contrast, antisense ODN to TRPC1 did not affect the number of flinches (n=10 for baseline 4?-PDD+ Hypo and n=6 for ODN groups, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Figure 8 Inflammatory mediators engage TRPV4, TRPC6 and TRPC1 channels in mechanical transduction Sensing of osmotic or mechanical stimuli by the phospholipid bilayer leads to the activation of membrane-bound G proteins and PLC and/or activation of PLA2 which generates 5?,6?- epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (5?,6?-EET) via the metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) which in turn act as a TRPV4 agonist. Integrins also detect osmotic and mechanical stimuli and activate Src protein tyrosine kinase family (Src PTK) which can directly activate cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA), phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation pathways. Inflammatory mediators bind to their respective G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) which also activate PLC and cAMP/PKA phosphorylation pathways. Activation of PLC generates inositol triphosphate (IP3) which acts on inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3R) to induce calcium release. IP3R can directly interact with TRPV4 and TRPC1 to activate/sensitize these channels. Activation of the different phosphorylation pathways will sensitize or desensitize TRPV4, TRPC6 and TRPC1. Putative heteromeric channels (?) which would further increase the complexity cannot be rule out. Green lines represent processes engaging TRPV4; blue lines, processes engaging TRPC1 and red lines, processes engaging TRPC6.

Intradermal injection of the simplified inflammatory soup (PGE2 and 5-HT, 100 ng each) induces a decrease in mechanical threshold that was reversed by intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 (1000 ng) at the same site (116±2 g, n=12 for baseline and 72±1 g, n=12 after PGE2 and 5-HT and 116±2 g, n=6 after GsMTx-4, P <0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). B . Intradermal injection of carrageenan (1%, 5 ?l) in rat hind paw induces a significant decrease in mechanical nociceptive threshold that was reversed by intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 (1000 ng) at the same site (118±1 g for baseline, 75±2 g after carrageenan and 113±3 g after GsMTx-4, n=8, P <0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). The effect of GsMTx-4 is reversible, 24 hrs after its administration the decrease in mechanical threshold was not significantly different from pre-GsMTx-4 baseline (P >0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Figure 3 GsMTx-4 reverses the decrease in mechanical threshold induced by inflammatory soup in half of sensitized C-fibers A . Intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 (1000 ng, 2.5 ?l) adjacent to mechanical receptive fields did not induce significant activity in C-fibers. Inset; mechanical thresholds of C-fibers were not significantly different from baseline after intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 (n=13). B . Response of individual C-fibers to sustained (60-s) threshold mechanical stimulation before (?) and after (?) intradermal injection of PGE2 and 5-HT and after a subsequent intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 (?), “n” is the number of fibers recorded. Injection of simplified inflammatory soup (PGE2 and 5-HT, 100 ng each) into the mechanical receptive field of C-fibers reduced the mechanical threshold in 15 out of 26 C-fibers. A subsequent injection of GsMTx-4 (1000 ng, 2.5 ?l) into the C-fiber's mechanical receptive field reversed the decrease in mechanical thresholds induced by simplified soup in 50% of the sensitized C-fibers (8 out of 15). C . There is no significant difference in the conduction velocity between C-fibers that were soup-sensitive (n=15) vs soup-insensitive (n=11) nor between C-fibers that were GsMTx-4-sensitive or GsMTx-4-insensitive (p>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). D . Response of sensitized C-fibers to suprathreshold (10-g) mechanical stimulation before (?) and after (?) intradermal injection of PGE2 and 5-HT and after a subsequent intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 (?). There was no significant difference between C-fibers that were GsMTx-4-sensitive or GsMTx-4-insensitive. Figure 4 GsMTx-4 reverses paclitaxel chemotherapy-induced mechanical hyperalgesia Rats treated with paclitaxel (daily for 10 days) develop mechanical hyperalgesia (118±2 g, n=12 before and 74±3 g, n=6 after paclitaxel, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Intradermal injection of GsMTx-4 in the hind paw 30 min before mechanical nociceptive threshold testing reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia (74±3 g before GsMTx-4 and 116±2 g after, n=6, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Twenty-four hours after the administration of GsMTx-4, mechanical nociceptive thresholds were not significantly different from pre-GsMTx-4 paw withdrawal thresholds (n=6 for each group, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Figure 5 GsMTx-4 also markedly reduces nociceptive flinching in response to hypotonic stimulation A . Rats treated with PGE2 and 5-HT, carrageenan or paclitaxel have, respectively a 4-, 3.6- and 3.2-fold increase in the number of nociceptive flinches in response to an intradermal injection of hypotonic solution (10 ?l of deionized water, 17 mOsm) compared to control rats. GsMTx-4 markedly reduced the number of flinches in PGE2 and 5-HT-treated (16±2, n=12 before and 8±1, n=6 after GsMTx-4), carrageenan-treated (17±1, n=12 before and 6±1, n=8 after GsMTx-4) and paclitaxel-treated (13±2, n=10 before and 7±1, n=6 after GsMTx-4) rats. All P<0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test. Twenty four hours after the administration of GsMTx-4, its effect was no longer present and there was no significant difference in the number of flinches between the different groups of rats (P>0.05, Tukey's multiple comparison test). B . Small-diameter (? 25?m) DRG neurons from TRPV4+/+ and TRPV4-/- were first challenged with a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT (10 ?M each) for 3 min and then challenged with a 30% hypotonic solution containing PGE2, 5-HT and GsMTx-4 (500 nM) for 3 min. The increase in [Ca2+]i induced by the hypotonic solution containing PGE2 and 5-HT is reduced in the presence of GsMTx-4 in TRPV4+/+ mice (2.4±0.2 ?M before and 1.7±0.2 ?M after GsMTx-4, n=24, P=0.007, paired Student's t -test) as well as in TRPV4-/- mice (1.7±0.1 ?M before and 1.4±0.1 ?M after GsMTx-4, n=14, P=0.03, paired Student's t -test). C . The cytoplasm of 47 DRG neurons was harvested after 2 d in culture and multiplex single-cell RT-PCR performed. Neurons expressed from none to all three of the mRNAs of interest; here we show the example of neurons expressing mRNA for TRPC1 (168 bp) or TRPC1 and TRPC6 (228 bp) or TRPC1, TRPC6 and TRPV4 (221 bp). D . Dissociated lumbar DRG neurons were cultured for 2 d. Cells were scraped in homogenization buffer and subcellular fractionation performed. The membrane fraction was separated on an electrophoresis gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was then probed in parallel with anti-TRPV4 (1:500), anti-TRPC1 (1:500) and anti-TRPC6 (1:500) antibodies. The expected bands at 120 kDa for TRPC1, 110 kDa for TRPC6 and the doublet bands at 98 and 107 kDa for TRPV4 were detected. Figure 6 Hyperalgesia to mechanical and hypotonic stimuli induced by PGE<sub>2</sub> and 5-HT is TRPC1 and TRPC6 dependent A . Treatment with TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense (AS) ODN for 3 days did not affect baseline nociceptive mechanical threshold in control rats (n=24 for baseline and n=6 for antisense and mismatch-treated rats, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). In contrast, the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by PGE2 and 5-HT was reversed by treatment with TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense compared to mismatch-treated (MM) rats (n= 18 for baseline and n=6 for antisense and mismatch-treated rats, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). The effect of the antisense was reversible, 4 d after the last ODN injection the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by PGE2 and 5-HT was not significantly different from pre-ODN baseline (P>0.05, Tukey's multiple-comparison test). B . Treatment with TRPC1 or TRPC6 antisense also markedly reduced the number of flinches in response to intradermal injection of hypotonic solution in the presence of PGE2 and 5-HT, compared to mismatch-treated rats (n=6 for Hypo in presence of PGE2+5-HT and n=6 for each ODN group, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). C . Paw withdrawal thresholds were markedly decreased twenty-four hours after thermal injury (118±1 g before vs 74±1 g after thermal injury, n=36, P<0.0001, paired Student's t -test). Treatment with TRPV4 or TRPC6 antisense for 3 days markedly reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia compared with mismatch ODN-treated rats (n=6 for all groups). Again, the effect of the antisense treatment was reversible, there was no significant difference in the mechanical thresholds between baseline and ODN-treated groups 4 days after the last ODN injection (n=36 for baseline and n=6 for each ODN group, all P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). In contrast, TRPC1 antisense did not affect the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by thermal injury. D . There was a 37±4 % and a 32±7 % decrease in TRPC1 and TRPC6 protein expression level respectively (n=3 for all groups, P<0.05, unpaired student's t -test), in DRG of rats treated with antisense (AS) ODN compared with mismatch ODN-treated rats (MM). The amount of protein loaded in each lane was normalized by probing the membrane with an anti-GAPDH antibody. Figure 7 Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to TRPC6 reverses 4?-PDD-induced hyperalgesia to mechanical and hypotonic stimuli A . Intradermal injection of 4 ?-PDD (2.5 ?g/2.5 ?l) in rat hind paw 30 min before measurement of nociceptive thresholds induced a significant decrease in mechanical thresholds (120±1 g, n=8 for baseline vs 76±1 g, n=8 after 4?-PDD, P<0.0001, paired Student's t-t est). In contrast, intradermal injection of the vehicle, 10% DMSO had no significant effect on mechanical thresholds (n=4 before and after 10% DMSO, P>0.05, paired Student's t -test). B . Treatment with TRPC6 antisense ODN for 3 d reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by 4?-PDD compared to mismatch-treated rats (n=8 for baseline and n=6 for each ODN group, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). The effect of the antisense was reversible, 4 days after the last ODN injection the mechanical thresholds was similar in baseline and ODN-treated rats (P>0.05, Tukey's multiple-comparison test). In contrast, treatment with TRPC1 antisense ODN does not affect the decrease in mechanical threshold induced by 4?-PDD (P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). C . Intradermal injection of 4?-PDD in rat hind paw induces a significant number of flinches (15±1, n=6). Moreover, rats pre-treated with 4?-PDD have a 6-fold increase in the number of nociceptive flinches in response to an injection of hypotonic solution (4±1, n=12 for hypotonic in absence and 24±3, n=10 in presence of 4?-PDD, P<0.0001, unpaired Student's t -test). Treatment with TRPC6 antisense ODN markedly reduced the number of flinches induced by intradermal injection of hypo in presence of 4?-PDD compared to mismatch-treated rats (24±3, n=10 for baseline 4?-PDD+ Hypo, 8±1, n=6 for antisense- and 20±1, n=6 for mismatch-treated rats, P<0.001, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Again the effect of antisense was reversible; 4 d after the last ODN injection the number of flinches was no significantly different between TRPC6 antisense- and mismatch-treated rats. In contrast, antisense ODN to TRPC1 did not affect the number of flinches (n=10 for baseline 4?-PDD+ Hypo and n=6 for ODN groups, P>0.05, Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test). Figure 8 Inflammatory mediators engage TRPV4, TRPC6 and TRPC1 channels in mechanical transduction Sensing of osmotic or mechanical stimuli by the phospholipid bilayer leads to the activation of membrane-bound G proteins and PLC and/or activation of PLA2 which generates 5?,6?- epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (5?,6?-EET) via the metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) which in turn act as a TRPV4 agonist. Integrins also detect osmotic and mechanical stimuli and activate Src protein tyrosine kinase family (Src PTK) which can directly activate cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA), phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation pathways. Inflammatory mediators bind to their respective G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) which also activate PLC and cAMP/PKA phosphorylation pathways. Activation of PLC generates inositol triphosphate (IP3) which acts on inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3R) to induce calcium release. IP3R can directly interact with TRPV4 and TRPC1 to activate/sensitize these channels. Activation of the different phosphorylation pathways will sensitize or desensitize TRPV4, TRPC6 and TRPC1. Putative heteromeric channels (?) which would further increase the complexity cannot be rule out. Green lines represent processes engaging TRPV4; blue lines, processes engaging TRPC1 and red lines, processes engaging TRPC6.
