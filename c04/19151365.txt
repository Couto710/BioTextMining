Rapamycin Reduces Seizure Frequency in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex The authors present a 10-year-old girl with tuberous sclerosis complex who has been receiving rapamycin for 10 months for seizure control. She was started at 0.05 mg/kg/d and titrated to an effective dose of 0.15 mg/kg/d. There was a dramatic reduction in seizure frequency with rapamycin therapy. Further studies are needed to objectively investigate the benefits of rapamycin in tuberous sclerosis complex and to clarify its mechanism of seizure control.
