Economic Sanctions, Military Activity, and Road Traffic Crashes in Vojvodina, Serbia Objectives Political violence has not been examined as a risk factor for traumatic injuries from road traffic crashes. We identify trends in road traffic crashes related to war-related military activity and international economic sanctions in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Serbia. Methods Overall road traffic crashes and crashes leading to hospitalization and fatality in Vojvodina, Serbia were examined from 1996 through 2001. Rates were calculated per 100,000 population and per 10,000 registered vehicles. Three time periods were examined: years with international sanctions and military activity; years with international sanctions but no military activity; and, years with neither sanctions nor military activity. Results Compared to the period with neither sanctions nor military activity, severe injury crashes were 1.23 times more frequent (95% CI = 1.19 – 1.27) during the period with sanctions and military activity and 1.21 times more frequent (95% CI= 1.16 – 1.27) during the period with sanctions but no military activity. Conclusions Our data suggest that vehicle travel became safer following the end of military action and economic sanctions. Road traffic safety needs to be a priority both during periods of political unrest and its recovery phase.  INTRODUCTION Road traffic crashes are the 11th leading cause of death globally and are predicted to become the third leading cause of disability-adjusted life years lost by the year 2020 ( 1 – 5 ). Low and middle-income countries have much higher road traffic fatality rates than high-income countries with poor populations bearing a disproportionate burden ( 1 , 6 ). High-income regions of Europe have the world’s lowest motor vehicle fatality rates, while lower-income regions of Europe have much higher rates. ( 7 ) Political instability, which is concentrated in low and middle-income areas, has not been widely examined as a contributing cause for road traffic crashes ( 8 ). Political instability focuses power and wealth disproportionately and leads to erosion of infrastructure. Roadway infrastructure may be particularly vulnerable during wartime, when fighting can directly destroy roadways, economic stress can decrease roadway development and maintenance, and lack of law and order can alter traffic patterns and decimate traffic safety enforcement efforts. We examine trends in road traffic crashes, injuries, and fatalities in the Autonomous Province (AP) of Vojvodina, which is the most developed part of the Republic of Serbia. AP Vojvodina is the most northern province of Serbia situated on 21,506 square kilometers west of Romania, east of Croatia, south of Hungary and north of Bosnia & Herzegovina. The province has just over 2 million inhabitants with various ethnic backgrounds, and is an important thoroughfare through Central Europe for both water and ground transportation. Although it was one of most prosperous regions in the former Yugoslavia, war and international economic sanctions have greatly influenced AP Vojvodina. The civil war that led to the break-up of former Yugoslavia began in 1991 and ended in 1995, with ongoing military operations by NATO lasting through 1999. In 1999, a NATO bombardment damaged most of the bridges in the region. Economic sanctions affected the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (including AP Vojvodina) from 1992 until 2001. This period was associated with an ongoing influx of refugees, out-migration of residents, active internal and external war, and country-level economic sanctions. During this period, investment in roadways plummeted. Total investments in road infrastructure fell from 100.7 million German marks (US 1985 $31.9 million) in 1985 to just 8.7 million (US 1993 $5.4 million) in 1993 ( 9 ). In 1985, the region rehabilitated 81.0 km of road and built 22.4 km of new roadways, compared with just 1.0 km rehabilitated and 2.3 km of newly built roads in 1993 ( 9 ). AP Vojvodina’s roadways have international significance. For example, the shortest roadway connections from Central Europe to the Middle East and from Eastern Europe to the Adriatic Sea pass through the region ( 10 ). Beginning in 2002, AP Vojvodina started to gain increasing autonomy and focus on safety and infrastructure. For example, new legislation to penalize drivers not wearing seat belts was introduced for the Republic in 2002 ( 11 ), and the number of registered motor vehicles increased by 89% from 1980 to 2001 ( 12 ). The aim of this study was to explore the epidemiology of road traffic crashes in AP Vojvodina from 1996 through 2005, with a focus on the severity of motor vehicle crashes.  Fatal and Severe Injury Road Traffic Crash Victim Characteristics Fatal and severe injury crash rates were nearly 2.4 times higher for males than females in all time periods ( Table 2 ). For both males and females, rates injury crashes were more than 1.2 times higher in time periods with sanctions and/or military activity compared with the period with no sanctions or military activity. For all time periods, severe injury crash rates were lowest for those aged zero though 14 and highest for the age group of 15 through 24. After the age of 24, rates by age group steadily declined until the age of 64, then increased for those aged 65 and above. The period with sanctions and military activity had the highest rates for all ages. The highest severe injury crash rates for each period were for vehicle drivers, followed by vehicle passengers, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Severe injury crash rates were significantly higher for all crash victims when comparing the period with both sanctions and military activity with the period with neither. However, severe injury crash rates for motor vehicle drivers were not significantly different while rate ratios for pedestrians, bicyclists, and pedestrians were significantly higher during both comparison periods.  Crash characteristics None of the crash characteristics showed significant trends by study period ( Table 3 ). For each period, approximately 20% of crashes occurred on rural roadways. Over 65% of the crashes occurred from 1:00 pm to midnight, while only approximately 10% of crashes occurred between midnight and 6:00 am. Alcohol was involved in 7.4% of crashes during the period with sanctions and military activity, 6.3% during the period with sanctions and no military activity, and 6.7% in the period with neither activity. These differences were not significant. Speeding was involved in over 40% of crashes in all periods.  Methods Overall road traffic crashes and crashes leading to hospitalization and fatality in Vojvodina, Serbia were examined from 1996 through 2001. Rates were calculated per 100,000 population and per 10,000 registered vehicles. Three time periods were examined: years with international sanctions and military activity; years with international sanctions but no military activity; and, years with neither sanctions nor military activity.  Results Compared to the period with neither sanctions nor military activity, severe injury crashes were 1.23 times more frequent (95% CI = 1.19 – 1.27) during the period with sanctions and military activity and 1.21 times more frequent (95% CI= 1.16 – 1.27) during the period with sanctions but no military activity.  Conclusions Our data suggest that vehicle travel became safer following the end of military action and economic sanctions. Road traffic safety needs to be a priority both during periods of political unrest and its recovery phase.  METHODS Study Population and Data Road traffic crashes, injuries, and fatalities were examined ecologically from 1996 through 2005. Three major periods were examined: 1996 through 1999 were years with both economic sanctions and military activity; 2000 – 2001 were years under international economic sanctions but with no military activity; 2002 – 2005 was a period with neither military activity nor economic sanctions. Data are from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Serbia, which maintains reports of road traffic crashes. Reports are filed for all crashes reported to the police, and reports are filled out by police at the scene of the crash. Police are required by law to respond to crashes that result in injury, heavy vehicle damage, or when a driver requests a response to the scene. Police must file a mandatory report. As with most crash reporting systems, many minor crashes may not be reported to police. No studies have evaluated the completeness, validity, or accuracy of crash reports. However, all variables used for this study had fewer than 3% missing responses. This reporting system is the most comprehensive source for information about road crashes and injuries. The Republican Institute for Statistics collects medical information on all hospitalizations and deaths, including external cause of injury codes. However, these reports are collected in aggregate form and only reported for fatalities. In 2004, the crash reporting system included a total of 266 road traffic deaths while the medical data included only 218 deaths. Since the medical data were provided in aggregate form, it was impossible to determine the proportion of cases that were in only one or both of the databases. This analysis included reports from the crash data because these data were more complete, included variables about the crash and its outcomes, and could be analyzed at the individual level. Variables Information about the crash included urban or rural location, time, whether or not alcohol was involved and whether or not speeding was involved in the crash. Alcohol use was determined at the scene through a breath test conducted by the police. Permission to administer this test is not required. If this result is positive, health institutions are required to draw blood to determine alcohol level. Blood alcohol equal to or greater than 0.05% was considered positive. Speed was estimated by police officers at the scene using crash reconstruction formulas. The reporting officers determined if the estimated speed was a contributing factor for the crash. Driver information included age, gender, and party (driver, passenger, pedestrian or bicyclist). Severity of the crash was identified using the police variable that categorizes injuries as none, minor, major, or fatal. Fatal injuries included individuals who died at the scene or at the hospital before discharge. Major injuries included individuals who had one of the following: the injury was life-threatening; a major organ was damaged or destroyed; a major organ was permanently or heavily weakened; the person required emergency transport to a hospital. If an injury was present but did not meet these criteria, it was coded as minor. Analysis Rates were calculated for each study period using two separate denominators. Population-based rates were estimated using census counts from the 1991 and 2002 census estimates. The 1991 estimates were applied to the years 1996 – 2000, and 2002 estimates were applied from 2002 through 2005. No inter-year census estimates were available. Rates were also calculated using registered vehicles as a denominator, and annual estimates of registered vehicles were provided by the Ministry of the Interior. Average annual rates for overall crashes, severe injury crashes, and fatal crashes were calculated for each of the study periods. Rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were used to compare study periods, with the period from 2002 through 2005 (when there were neither sanctions nor military activity) used as the reference. Crash severity ratios were compared by year using the ratio of severe and fatal crashes to the number of overall crashes. Crash rates for severe and fatally injured victims were compared by year using population-based denominators. Crash characteristics were compared by period using chi-square tests with p < 0.05 considered significant.

Crash characteristics were compared by period using chi-square tests with p < 0.05 considered significant.  RESULTS Crash Rates Crash rates were highest during the period with no sanctions and no military activity ( Table 1 ). From 1996 through 1999, a period in which there were both economic sanctions and military activity, there was an annual average crash rate of 768.2 per 100,000 population and 295.2 per 10,000 registered vehicles ( Table 1 ). The crash rate fell to 711.3 per 100,000 population in the next period with sanctions but no military activity, and then increased to 793.5 per 100,000 population in the period that had neither economic sanctions nor military activity. Compared to the period with neither sanctions nor military activity, the population-based rate ratio for the period with sanctions and military activity was 0.97 (95% CI = 0.96 – 0.98), indicating that crashes were 3% lower. For the period with sanctions but no military activity, the rate ratio was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.87 – 0.93). Trends based on registered vehicles were similar. In contrast with the trends for overall crashes, severe injury and fatal crash rates were higher in periods with sanctions and military activity. Compared to the period with neither sanctions nor military activity, severe injury crashes were 1.23 time more frequent (95% CI = 1.19 – 1.27) during the period with sanctions and military activity and 1.21 (95% CI= 1.16 – 1.27) times more frequent during the period with sanctions but no military activity. Fatalities showed a stronger trend, with an increased risk ratio of 1.38 (95% CI = 1.28 – 1.49) during the period with sanctions and military activity and 1.25 (95% CI = 1.13 – 1.38) during the period with sanctions and no military activity. These trends were similar for rates measured per 10,000 registered vehicles. Crash Severity Crash severity was measured as fatal and severe injury crashes per 10,000 reported crashes (Figure 1). From 1996 through 1998, there were approximately 1200 severe and fatal injury crashes per 10,000 crashes. Crash severity peaked at over 1400 fatal and severe injury crashes per 10,000 crashes in 1999, during the NATO bombardment, and remained high until 2001. Following the end of sanctions and military action, crash severity decreased to approximately 1,000. Fatal and Severe Injury Road Traffic Crash Victim Characteristics Fatal and severe injury crash rates were nearly 2.4 times higher for males than females in all time periods ( Table 2 ). For both males and females, rates injury crashes were more than 1.2 times higher in time periods with sanctions and/or military activity compared with the period with no sanctions or military activity. For all time periods, severe injury crash rates were lowest for those aged zero though 14 and highest for the age group of 15 through 24. After the age of 24, rates by age group steadily declined until the age of 64, then increased for those aged 65 and above. The period with sanctions and military activity had the highest rates for all ages. The highest severe injury crash rates for each period were for vehicle drivers, followed by vehicle passengers, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Severe injury crash rates were significantly higher for all crash victims when comparing the period with both sanctions and military activity with the period with neither. However, severe injury crash rates for motor vehicle drivers were not significantly different while rate ratios for pedestrians, bicyclists, and pedestrians were significantly higher during both comparison periods.

DISCUSSION Throughout this study period, the European Union experienced a significant decrease in crashes and crash fatalities that was not found in AP Vojvodina. AP Vojvodina experienced a slight increase in crash rates after 2001, which coincided with the end of military activity and international sanctions ( 13 ). Increases in overall crashes could be due to increased vehicle miles travelled that resulted from the end of war activity, lifting of curfews, increases in new registered vehicles that arose after more liberal import policies for international vehicles were implemented in 2000, and an improved standard of living ( 9 ). Vehicle miles were not available for analysis. In contrast, crashes that caused fatal and severe injury were significantly higher during periods with sanctions and/or military activity. These trends were found using two different denominators: population and registered vehicles. Information using vehicle miles travelled would likely result in even higher differences by period. For example, the NATO bombardment in 1999 nearly stopped road traffic for 3 months and led to significant roadway damage, but this year also had the highest ratio of severe and fatal crashes to overall crashes. Our data suggest that vehicle travel for drivers, passengers, bicyclists, and pedestrians became safer following the end of military activity and economic sanctions. These findings are consistent with research conducted in Israel during the first Gulf War, when decreases in traffic injuries during a period of missile attacks and curfews were offset by an increase in the case fatality rate ( 8 ). During war operations, severe crashes could be directly tied to political instability because of the loss of general law and order and indirectly tied to severe crashes due to reduced traffic safety controls and war damage to roadway infrastructures. Deaths could also have been increased because of stresses from war activity on Emergency Medical Services. For example, limited access to fuel because of sanctions and damage to roadways made transportation of injured individuals difficult. Following the war, several factors may have contributed to decreases in severe crashes. New legislation introduced in 2002 required seat belt use, and an increased presence of traffic enforcement police likely contributed to enforcement of the new legislation. The increase in newer vehicles with modern safety standards could also contribute to the reductions in severe injury. Several trends in this data are similar to those previously reported for other populations. For example, crash rates were higher for males than females and less experienced drivers were the most frequent victims of road traffic crashes ( 14 – 18 ). Of all road users, crash fatality and injury rates were highest among vehicle occupants, which is similar to trends throughout the EU ( 13 , 19 ). Results for pedestrian fatalities and injuries were similar to the European Union, but lower than reported in many low- and middle-income countries where pedestrians are often the most vulnerable road users ( 14 , 15 , 20 , 21 ). However, bicycle operators represented a far higher proportion of injured road users in AP Vojvodina (14.5%) than in the EU (4.5%), ( 13 ). One explanation is the frequent use of bicycles in AP Vojvodina for transportation between towns, on narrow roadways, and by all ages including the very old. Special bicycle tracks are very rare and exist in just a few of the largest cities, and many of these are in very poor condition. Helmet use by bicyclists is extremely rare, and helmet use is not mandatory. ( 22 – 23 ). Efforts to improve bicycle-travelling conditions and to increase helmet use need to be a priority for the region. Rural roads accounted for nearly a quarter of all crashes. Agriculture is one of the leading economic sectors in AP Vojvodina. Agricultural vehicles are often present on the roadways, both on local and main roads, and these large, slow-moving vehicles present a crash hazard ( 24 ). Several limitations are important to note. Our study is ecologic in that individual road traffic crashes cannot be tied directly or indirectly to political activity or its resulting damage. Road traffic crashes included only those reported to law enforcement. Although the system for reporting and responding to traffic crashes did not change during the political periods, it is difficult to know to what extent the changing environment impacted reporting. The two denominators were used for rate calculations, population and registered vehicles. The population changed dramatically during the political periods with both out-and in-migration. Census estimates may not accurately reflect these population shifts. The denominator of registered vehicles excludes an unknown number of unregistered and foreign vehicles, and crashes of these vehicles were in the numerator. During the period of international sanctions, many refugees coming to AP Vojvodina had vehicles registered in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina because legislation for vehicle registration in these countries was less restrictive. Although both denominators have uncertainty, the agreement found between them adds confidence to our findings. Because rate estimates were population based and not sampled, the confidence intervals around the rate ratios are very narrow. These confidence intervals do not incorporate uncertainty in the measurements of the denominators themselves, and thus may not accurately reflect the error in the effect estimates. These findings suggest that political unrest could be a related to increased severity of road traffic crashes. Road traffic safety needs to be a public health priority both during periods of political unrest and its recovery phase. Large social and economic changes occurred and are ongoing in AP Vojvodina after the war, including increases in vehicle ownership and traffic density. These trends could pose a long-term road traffic safety problem if engineering, legislative, and educational prevention approaches are left unaddressed. Serbian public health institutions can play a vital role in recognizing and educating about the need to improve roadway and vehicle design as well as the role of human factors in crash risk ( 25 – 26 ). WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT Although considerable research has examined the epidemiology of road traffic crashes, the vast majority of this research is from high-income countries. Much less is known about road traffic crashes in low- and middle-income countries, and this is the first study to examine road traffic crash severity in Serbia. Political instability and associated economic sanctions can have damaging effects on roadway infrastructures. However, political unrest has not previously been examined as an important factor in road safety trends. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS Road traffic crashes overall increased over time, as war ended in the region, economic sanctions were lifted, and the region experienced increased governmental autonomy. However, crashes leading to severe and fatal injury were highest during the periods with war and economic sanctions. This study suggests that periods with political unrest and during imposed economic sanctions may increase the severity of road traffic crashes. Future research should further investigate the role of political instability on road traffic safety and identify the best interventions to address these issues.  DISCUSSION Throughout this study period, the European Union experienced a significant decrease in crashes and crash fatalities that was not found in AP Vojvodina. AP Vojvodina experienced a slight increase in crash rates after 2001, which coincided with the end of military activity and international sanctions ( 13 ). Increases in overall crashes could be due to increased vehicle miles travelled that resulted from the end of war activity, lifting of curfews, increases in new registered vehicles that arose after more liberal import policies for international vehicles were implemented in 2000, and an improved standard of living ( 9 ). Vehicle miles were not available for analysis. In contrast, crashes that caused fatal and severe injury were significantly higher during periods with sanctions and/or military activity. These trends were found using two different denominators: population and registered vehicles. Information using vehicle miles travelled would likely result in even higher differences by period. For example, the NATO bombardment in 1999 nearly stopped road traffic for 3 months and led to significant roadway damage, but this year also had the highest ratio of severe and fatal crashes to overall crashes. Our data suggest that vehicle travel for drivers, passengers, bicyclists, and pedestrians became safer following the end of military activity and economic sanctions. These findings are consistent with research conducted in Israel during the first Gulf War, when decreases in traffic injuries during a period of missile attacks and curfews were offset by an increase in the case fatality rate ( 8 ). During war operations, severe crashes could be directly tied to political instability because of the loss of general law and order and indirectly tied to severe crashes due to reduced traffic safety controls and war damage to roadway infrastructures. Deaths could also have been increased because of stresses from war activity on Emergency Medical Services. For example, limited access to fuel because of sanctions and damage to roadways made transportation of injured individuals difficult. Following the war, several factors may have contributed to decreases in severe crashes. New legislation introduced in 2002 required seat belt use, and an increased presence of traffic enforcement police likely contributed to enforcement of the new legislation. The increase in newer vehicles with modern safety standards could also contribute to the reductions in severe injury. Several trends in this data are similar to those previously reported for other populations. For example, crash rates were higher for males than females and less experienced drivers were the most frequent victims of road traffic crashes ( 14 – 18 ). Of all road users, crash fatality and injury rates were highest among vehicle occupants, which is similar to trends throughout the EU ( 13 , 19 ). Results for pedestrian fatalities and injuries were similar to the European Union, but lower than reported in many low- and middle-income countries where pedestrians are often the most vulnerable road users ( 14 , 15 , 20 , 21 ). However, bicycle operators represented a far higher proportion of injured road users in AP Vojvodina (14.5%) than in the EU (4.5%), ( 13 ). One explanation is the frequent use of bicycles in AP Vojvodina for transportation between towns, on narrow roadways, and by all ages including the very old. Special bicycle tracks are very rare and exist in just a few of the largest cities, and many of these are in very poor condition. Helmet use by bicyclists is extremely rare, and helmet use is not mandatory. ( 22 – 23 ). Efforts to improve bicycle-travelling conditions and to increase helmet use need to be a priority for the region. Rural roads accounted for nearly a quarter of all crashes. Agriculture is one of the leading economic sectors in AP Vojvodina. Agricultural vehicles are often present on the roadways, both on local and main roads, and these large, slow-moving vehicles present a crash hazard ( 24 ). Several limitations are important to note. Our study is ecologic in that individual road traffic crashes cannot be tied directly or indirectly to political activity or its resulting damage. Road traffic crashes included only those reported to law enforcement. Although the system for reporting and responding to traffic crashes did not change during the political periods, it is difficult to know to what extent the changing environment impacted reporting. The two denominators were used for rate calculations, population and registered vehicles. The population changed dramatically during the political periods with both out-and in-migration. Census estimates may not accurately reflect these population shifts. The denominator of registered vehicles excludes an unknown number of unregistered and foreign vehicles, and crashes of these vehicles were in the numerator. During the period of international sanctions, many refugees coming to AP Vojvodina had vehicles registered in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina because legislation for vehicle registration in these countries was less restrictive. Although both denominators have uncertainty, the agreement found between them adds confidence to our findings. Because rate estimates were population based and not sampled, the confidence intervals around the rate ratios are very narrow. These confidence intervals do not incorporate uncertainty in the measurements of the denominators themselves, and thus may not accurately reflect the error in the effect estimates. These findings suggest that political unrest could be a related to increased severity of road traffic crashes. Road traffic safety needs to be a public health priority both during periods of political unrest and its recovery phase. Large social and economic changes occurred and are ongoing in AP Vojvodina after the war, including increases in vehicle ownership and traffic density. These trends could pose a long-term road traffic safety problem if engineering, legislative, and educational prevention approaches are left unaddressed. Serbian public health institutions can play a vital role in recognizing and educating about the need to improve roadway and vehicle design as well as the role of human factors in crash risk ( 25 – 26 ).
