Gastrin Releasing Protein Receptor â€“Specific Gold Nanorods: Breast and Prostate Tumor-avid Nanovectors for Molecular Imaging Gastrin releasing protein receptor-specific bombesin peptide (BBN) gold nanoconjugates were successfully synthesized using gold nanorods and dithiolated peptide. The gold nanorod-bombesin (GNR-BBN) conjugates showed extraordinary in vitro stabilities against various biomolecules including NaCl, cysteine, histidine, BSA, HSA, and DTT. Quantitative measure on the binding affinity (IC50) of GNR-BBN conjugates toward prostate and breast tumor cells were evaluated. The IC50 values establish that GNR-BBN conjugates have strong affinity toward the GRP receptors on both the tumors. Detailed cellular interaction studies of GNR-BBN conjugates revealed that nanorods internalize via a receptor mediated endocytosis pathway. The receptor specific interactions of GNR-BBN conjugates provide realistic opportunities in the design and development of in vivo molecular imaging and therapy agents for cancer.
