A Phase-Contrast MRI-based Elastography Technique Detects Early Hypertensive Changes in ex-vivo Porcine Aortic Wall Purpose To measure the elastic properties of ex-vivo porcine aortas in control and hypertensive groups using a phase contrast MRI-based elastography technique. Materials and Methods Female domestic pigs were randomized to a normal control group (N; n=5) or a renovascular hypertension group (HT; n=5) for the duration of 3 months. Mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in the hypertension group than in the control group (173 ± 12 vs. 115 ± 11 mmHg, p?0.05). The animals were euthanized after 3 months of hypertension and abdominal aortas harvested. The ex-vivo aortic samples were then examined using a phase contrast MRI-based elastography technique. Results The Young's modulus-wall thickness product, a reflection of vascular stiffness, was significantly higher in the hypertension group than in the control group (0.571 ± 0.080 vs. 0.419 ± 0.026, p<0.05). Histological analysis and staining confirmed increased intima-media thickness and collagen content in the hypertensive aorta, while elastin staining showed no difference. Conclusion The current study shows that MR elastography offers a method to study the physiologic changes in the arterial wall secondary to early hypertension.

Conclusion The current study shows that MR elastography offers a method to study the physiologic changes in the arterial wall secondary to early hypertension.  Methods Hypertensive Porcine Model The current study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and all procedures were in line with the NIH Guidelines. Three month-old female domestic pigs were randomized to two different three-month study groups. The first (control) group included pigs that were observed with no additional intervention (N, n=5). The second (hypertensive) group comprised pigs in which systemic arterial hypertension was induced by placement of a copper-stent in the left renal artery leading to unilateral renal artery stenosis, as previously established (HT, n=5) ( 15 - 17 ). Continuous blood pressure measurements were obtained in all animals by use of a telemetry system (PhysioTel, Data Sciences) implanted at baseline in the left femoral artery. Mean arterial pressure was recorded at 5-minute intervals and averaged for each 24-hour period. At the end of the study period, the pigs were euthanized with a lethal injection of sodium pentobarbitol (100 mg/kg IV; Sleepaway, Fort Dodge Laboratories). Porcine abdominal aortas were harvested immediately after euthanasia and placed in a Krebs solution. Separate aortic samples were subjected to formalin fixation and paraffin embedding for histological analyses. The connective tissue was removed from the outside of the aorta with side branches tied off. The diameter of the porcine aortas was approximately 1.5-1.8 cm with a length of approximately 30 cm. Each ex-vivo aorta was inserted into a MR head coil under static pressure (approximately 115mm of mercury) filled with normal saline (0.9% NaCl). An electromechanical impulse generator was applied to the vessel wall Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technique For all experiments, imaging was performed on a 1.5 T whole body imager (GE Medical Systems, Waukesha, WI, USA) utilizing a transmit and receive head coil. The imaging technique incorporated oscillating, motion sensitizing field gradients that were synchronized with the propagating mechanical waves ( 8 , 9 ). Data acquisition parameters were: gradient echo acquisition, single coronal slice of 5 mm thickness, 100 ms repetition time (TR), 256 × 64 acquisition matrix which was interpolated to 256 × 256 matrix, 30 flip angle, and FOV of 20 cm. The porcine aorta (diameter 1.5-1.8 cm) was inserted into a MR head coil during imaging with an electromechanical impulse generator applied to the vessel wall. The imaging plane was along the longitudinal axis of the vessel. The impulse driver delivered a burst count of 8 cycles with 4 imaging time offsets obtained at 13-s intervals throughout a vibration cycle for each condition. The wavelengths were calculated by peak to peak measurement of the propagating longitudinal wave imaged within the arterial wall ( Fig. 1a ). The experiments were conducted using five impulse frequencies (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 Hz). Post-processing assessment of the data consisted of directional filtering as described by Manduca et al. ( 18 ) to calculate exact wavelength (peak to peak distance). A minimum of a half-wavelength was necessary to reliably resolve two areas of differing stiffness. The calculated wavelengths were averaged across the image and then normalized to 100 Hz. The mean Young's modulus-wall thickness products were calculated using the following expression, which was developed previously ( 10 ) E t = 2 ? a i ? 2 f 2 . where E is the Young's modulus, t is the wall thickness of the aorta, a i is the interior aorta radius, ? is the density of the interior fluid, ? is the wavelength, and f is the frequency of dynamic excitation. Histologic and morphometric analyses Hematoxylin-and-Eosin (H&E), Elastica-van-Gieson (EvG), and Sirus-Red staining of cross-section of aortic tissue samples, 5 ?m in thickness, were performed as previously reported ( 16 , 19 ). Using a digital image system (Nikon DXM 1200; Camera), morphometric analyses on EvG-stained slides were carried out for the assessment of lumen area, internal elastic lamina (IEL) area, and external elastic lamina (EEL) area at a magnification of 10×. Intima area was calculated as IEL area minus lumen area and media area as EEL area minus IEL area, allowing calculation of the intima-media ratio. Intima thickness was calculated as IEL radius minus lumen radius and media thickness as EEL radius minus IEL radius. Elastin content of the aortic wall was quantified on EvG-stained slides using Meta Imaging Series 4.6 (MetaMorph, Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA, USA) and expressed as percentage of total surface area ( 14 , 17 ). In similar technique, collagen content was quantified on Sirus-Red-stained slides. Statistical analysis Continuous data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Two group comparisons were performed using Student's t-test. Statistical significance was accepted for p<0.05.

Results As expected and outlined in Table 1 , mean arterial pressure was higher in hypertensive than in control animals. Animal weight and total cholesterol concentrations were not significantly different ( Table 1 ). The propagating wave images were well visualized in the aortas from both the control and the hypertensive group ( Fig. 1a and b ). From these images, quantitative analyses demonstrated a significant increase in the Young's modulus-wall thickness (E*t) product of the hypertensive aortas compared to the controls (0.571 ± 0.080 vs. 0.419 ± 0.026 kPa-m, p<0.05) ( Fig. 1c ). Aorta segments from control and hypertensive animals were analyzed morphometrically on EvG-stained slides. In hypertensive aortas, there was an increased intima ( Table 2 ) and media thickness ( Table 2 ). Calculation of the intima-media thickness ratio showed no changes between control and hypertensive aortas ( Table 2 ). Area measurements demonstrated similar changes ( Table 2 ). From the wall thickness values and the E*t product, the Young's modulus could be calculated and demonstrated a decrease in the hypertensive aortas ( Table 2 ). The Sirius Red staining demonstrated a significantly higher collagen content in the hypertensive aortas versus the controls (40.14 ± 3.23 vs. control 26.95 ± 5.25 % aortic wall area) ( Fig. 2a and c ), especially within the adventitia at the junction to the media. EvG-staining showed no change in the elastin content of the controls (hypertensive 38.99 ± 6.59 vs. control 35.79 ± 4.04 % aortic wall area) ( Fig. 2b and d ).

EvG-staining showed no change in the elastin content of the controls (hypertensive 38.99 ± 6.59 vs. control 35.79 ± 4.04 % aortic wall area) ( Fig. 2b and d ).  Discussion This phase contrast MRI technique can visualize harmonic mechanical excitations in the aortic wall. With this technique, differences between normal and hypertensive animals can be assessed even in short periods of hypertension. To analyze what this technique is measuring, histological analysis of the aortas reveals near doubling of the wall thickness and increasing collagen density, while the intima-media ratio is unchanged. These findings correlate with symmetrical increases in the intima and media thickness in hypertensive aortas as well as increasing collagen content. The E*t product significantly increases in hypertensive aortas. This increase could be a reflection of the increasing wall thickness or could be secondary to changing Young's modulus and wall thickness. Calculation of the Young's modulus showed a decrease in hypertensive aortas. The decreasing Young's modulus may reflect the manner in which the aortas were studied. We examined our aortas under isobaric conditions with the same luminal pressure for control and hypertensive aortas. Several studies have shown that comparison of arterial wall elasticity under isobaric conditions can demonstrate decreasing Young's modulus in hypertensive subjects ( 20 , 21 ). Their explanation for this finding is that the Young's modulus is measured at a lower point on the compliance-pressure curve for the hypertensive subject versus the control subject ( 20 , 21 ). Collagen measurements in normal and hypertensive aortas show a doubling in collagen density in hypertensive aortas, while elastin content is unchanged between the two groups. Thus, in this animal model of early hypertension, two major changes are occurring in wall thickness and collagen content. These two factors contribute to changing the E*t product which can be quantitated using this phase contrast MRI-based technique. Therefore, the E*t product measurement may more accurately assess changing wall characteristics occurring in early hypertension by taking into account both parameters. In conclusion, this study demonstrated use of a phase contrast MRI technique to visualize differences in ex-vivo aortic wall stiffness in a porcine model of hypertension. The methodology offers a potentially non-invasive method for early evaluation of the arterial wall mechanical properties without disruption or invasion of the artery itself. However, further investigation is needed on in-vivo arteries. The results do support the hypothesis that subtle changes in arterial elasticity are initiated even during short (3 months) periods of hypertension. Furthermore, these changes can be detected and quantified using this phase contrast MRI-based elastography technique. This would enable the ability to directly monitor the primary organ (vascular wall) damage to aid in therapeutic treatment assessment and possibly study whether arterial wall changes can be reversed in-vivo. The limitations of this study include the use of ex-vivo aortic tissue, use of porcine rather than human arteries, and the fact that measurements were obtained in isobaric conditions. Further investigation will include examination of in-vivo arteries to assess its sensitivity and ultimately study progressive arterial wall elasticity changes in the hypertensive animals.
