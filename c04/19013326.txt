Acute Kidney Injury in HIV- Infected Patients Acute kidney injury is common in HIV-infected patients, and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Prior to the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy, acute kidney injury in HIV-positive patients was most commonly the result of volume depletion, septicemia, or nephrotoxic medications. Acute kidney injury remains a significant problem in the antiretroviral era, and is still commonly attributed to infection or nephrotoxic medications. Less common causes such as direct infectious insults, immune restoration inflammatory syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and obstruction should be considered when the underlying process is not obvious. In addition to advanced HIV disease, several other patient characteristics have emerged as potential risk factors for acute kidney injury in the antiretroviral era, including older age, diabetes, pre-existing chronic kidney disease, and hepatitis co-infection or liver disease.  Conclusion AKI remains common in HIV-infected patients, despite improvements in morbidity and mortality in the ART era. Beyond identifying patients at risk for AKI, successful prevention depends on optimizing immune status, as well as identifying and aggressively treating diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and hepatitis co-infection. The importance of prevention or early recognition of AKI is highlighted by the strong association between AKI and mortality among HIV-infected patients. Recognition of AKI is also essential to ensure proper dose adjustment of ART and medications used to treat the acute illness that often accompanies AKI. Further studies are needed to determine if AKI is an independent predictor of mortality or rather a marker for greater systemic illness. The acute and chronic impact of various medications employed in the HIV-infected patient, including ART and antibiotic medications, should also be further investigated in order to decrease toxicity. Future studies of AKI in HIV-infected patients should attempt to use standard definitions to allow for comparison across studies.
