Interferon alpha treatment of NZW/BXSB F1 females mimics some but not all features associated with the Yaa mutation Objectives Male NZW/BXSB mice develop anti-phospholipid syndrome (APL) and proliferative glomerulonephritis that is markedly accelerated by the Yaa locus encoding an extra copy of TLR7. Female NZW/BXSB mice with only one active copy of TLR7 develop late onset glomerulonephritis but not APL. Since a major function of TLR7 is to induce Type I interferons, our goal was to determine whether interferon alpha (IFN?) can induce or accelerate SLE manifestations in female NZW/BXSB. Methods 8 week old female NZW/BXSB F1 mice were injected with a single dose of Adenovirus expressing IFN?. Mice were monitored for thrombocytopenia and proteinuria. Sera were tested for anti-cardiolipin and anti-Sm RNP antibodies. Mice were sacrificed at 17 or 22 weeks of age and kidneys and hearts were examined histologically and by immunohistochemistry. Spleen cells were phenotyped and ELISpot assays for autoantibody producing B cells were performed. Results IFN? markedly accelerated nephritis and death in female NZW/BXSB F1 mice. A significant increase in spleen cell numbers associated with a striking increase in activated B and T cells were seen. Marginal zone B cells were retained. IFN? increased titers of autoantibodies but thrombocytopenia was not found and cardiac damage was milder than in males. Conclusions IFN? accelerates the development of renal inflammatory disease in the female NZW/BXSB mice but induces only mild anti-phospholipid syndrome and does not induce thrombocytopenia. The effect of IFN? on SLE disease manifestations is strain dependent. These findings are relevant to our understanding of the physiologic significance of the interferon signature.

Methods IFN? adenovirus treatment NZW/BXSB mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were bred in our facility. 35 female F1 mice were treated at 8w of age with a single i.v. injection of 109 particles of IFN? adenovirus (Ad-IFN?, Qbiogene Morgan Irvine, CA). 30 controls received the same dose of ?-galactosidase-expressing adenovirus (Ad-LacZ), or no treatment. 15 mice received the TLR7 agonist Imiquimod 25ug i.p. three times weekly for 6 weeks. Mice were tested for proteinuria every two weeks (Multistick, Fisher, Pittsburg, PA) and bled periodically for serologic analysis. Platelets were counted at 8, 17 and 22w of age using a Coulter counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton CA). Groups of 6-8 mice were sacrificed at 17 or 22w of age, and the remaining mice observed for proteinuria onset and survival. These experiments were carried out according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Columbia University and the Feinstein Institute. Total IgG levels and antibodies to Cardiolipin and Sm/RNP ELISA plates (Falcon Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ) were coated with unlabeled goat anti-mouse IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b or IgG3 (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) overnight at 4°C. After blocking, the plates were incubated with dilutions of serum for 1hr at 37°C followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse isotype-specific antibodies and substrate solution (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). Standard curves were established using serial dilutions of purified antibody of the appropriate isotype (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MA). Sm/RNP (Arotec Diagnostics Limited, Wellington, NZ) was coated onto Falcon plates at 1?g/ml in PBS. ELISA was performed according to manufacturers' instructions. Anti-cardiolipin titers were measured as previously described ( 9 ). A high titer serum was run in serial dilution on each plate as a quantitation control. ELISpot assay ELISpot assays for total immunoglobulin-secreting cells and for anti-cardiolipin–secreting B cells were performed on isolated spleen and bone marrow cells as previously described ( 9 ). Flow cytometry analysis Spleens were analyzed for B and T cell markers as previously described ( 10 ) using antibodies to CD4, CD8 (Caltag, Burlingham, CA) and CD19. Splenic dendritic cells were identified using PE anti-CD11b and FITC anti-CD11c. B cell subsets were identified as follows: follicular (CD19+/IgM+/IgD+); marginal zone (CD19+/CD21hi/CD23lo); class-switched (CD19+/IgMlo/IgDlo); immature (CD19+/IgMhi/IgDlo). CD4+ T cells were classified as naive (CD62Lhi/CD44lo) or memory (CD62Llo/CD44hi). Activated T and B cells were defined as CD69hi. Unless otherwise stated all antibodies were obtained from BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA. Histologic Analysis of Kidneys and Hearts Scoring of H&E sections of the kidneys and hearts was performed using a 1 to 4 scale for glomerular damage and interstitial inflammation as previously described ( 9 ). Histologic analyses were performed by observers blinded to the treatment group of the mice. Cryosections of kidney were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG2a, PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgD (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, Alabama), F4/80 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California), CD4, CD19, or CD11c (BD Pharmingen) in 2%BSA/PBS containing 0.5% anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (BD Pharmingen) for 1hr at room temperature. Slides were counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen) and images were captured using a digital CCD-camera system connected to a Zeiss microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood NY).

Results Administration of a small dose of Ad-IFN? markedly accelerated disease onset in female NZW/BXSB mice and proteinuria occurred 4-12 weeks after virus injection, followed rapidly by death (IFN? vs. controls p<0.0001 for proteinuria and death - Figure 1A ). Serum IFN? levels were below detectable levels in treated mice. However two weeks after virus injection there was a significant increase in the expression of several IFN inducible genes in the spleens of treated mice to levels comparable with those of proteinuric male mice (data not shown). Imiquimod had no effect on autoantibody production, proteinuria onset or mortality and these mice were not studied further. The kidneys of IFN? treated mice contained intense IgG deposits. Infiltrating F4/80 positive macrophages were located in the interstitium and around glomeruli, whereas CD11c positive dendritic cells were within the glomerular tuft ( Figure 1B, 1D ). This pattern is similar to that observed in male NZW/BXSB mice ( 11 ). In contrast, few glomerular or interstitial infitrates were present in 22 week control mice ( Figure 1C, 1E ). 17-22w IFN? treated mice had significant renal damage compared with untreated controls ( Figure 1F - p<0.001 for glomerular score and p<0.01 for interstitial score). Mild cardiac damage was also observed in the IFN? treated mice but not in the untreated controls ( Figure 1G ). In contrast, thrombocytopenia was not found ( Figure 1H ), despite the presence of high titers of anti-phospholipid autoantibodies in the serum. Serum IgG2a levels increased significantly in the IFN? treated mice compared with controls (1036.2 +/- 452.9 vs. 433.4 +/- 258.9 ug/ml; p < 0.0072 at 12w). The difference was no longer significant at 17w. In contrast, serum IgG1 levels were significantly lower in the IFN? group than in the controls at both 12 and 17w (59.8 +/- 31.5 vs. 142.3 +/-71.5 ug/ml; p< 0.001 and 116.1 +/- 91.0 vs. 209.6 +/- 95.5ug/ml; p < 0.02 respectively). Autoantibodies to both cardiolipin (p < 0.004 at 14w and p < 0.03 at 18-20w) and Sm/RNP (p < 0.02 at 12w, p < 0.04 at 16w) arose earlier in the IFN? treated mice than in age matched untreated controls; the maximal autoantibody titers reached were comparable to male mice ( Figure 2A, 2B ). Low titer anti-dsDNA antibodies arose late in both treated and untreated mice (not shown). In accordance with these data, ELISpot analysis of spleens revealed an increase in both the frequency (p < 0.04 at 17w and p < 0.0001 at 22w) and total number of IgG (p < 0.003 at 17w and p < 0.0001 at 22w) and IgG anti-cardiolipin antibody producing B cells (p < 0.0001 at 22w) in IFN? treated mice compared with controls ( Figure 2C, 2D ). Anti-cardiolipin producing B cells also increased in the bone marrows (3.93 +/-.99 per 105 cells in IFN? treated vs. 1.37 +/- 0.87 in controls at 17w; p < 0.02; 9.93 +/-4.48 in IFN? treated vs.3.52 +/- 2.92 in controls at 22w; p < 0.03) Phenotypic analysis of spleen cells revealed a marked increase in spleen cell number in the treated mice compared with controls, with a significant increase in CD11b positive cells and activated CD4 T cells and B cells ( Table 1 ). Circulating monocytes in the blood were also twofold increased (not shown). All B cell subsets were expanded in the treated mice. This is in contrast to male NZW/BXSB mice in which the overexpression of TLR7 results in loss of the marginal zone subset and a marked increase in the follicular to marginal zone B cell ratio (Kahn and Davidson, unpublished). There was also a significant increase in the number of class switched B cells and plasma cells in the spleens of IFN? treated mice ( Table 1 ). Germinal centers appeared earlier in the spleens of IFN? treated mice compared with untreated controls, but the spleens became disorganized with loss of follicular architecture and germinal centers as the mice aged, similar to males ( Figure 2E-J ).

Discussion The association of the IFN signature with SLE in humans and the ability to induce accelerated SLE in some murine SLE models with IFN? has led to the hypothesis that IFN? is an important pathogenic cytokine in SLE and a target for therapy ( 3 ). IFN? accelerates SLE in female NZB/W mice in which it induces early development of anti-dsDNA antibodies and nephritis ( 2 ). We have shown in NZB/W mice that IFN? rapidly induces germinal centers that generate short-lived plasma cells producing pathogenic IgG2a autoantibodies in a T cell-dependent fashion, whereas pathogenic IgG3 autoantibodies are generated in a T cell-independent fashion (Liu, submitted). In other mouse models however, Type I interferons have protective effects with respect to SLE initiation, indicating strain heterogeneity ( 12 ). NZW/BXSB mice develop autoantibodies to cardiolipin and to RNA-associated antigens. Together with immune mediated thrombocytopenia, inflammatory glomerulonephritis and a thrombotic vasculopathy that affects the small coronary arteries leading to myocardial infarcts, myocardial fibrosis and a dilated cardiomyopathy ( 8 , 9 , 13 ). Male mice have markedly accelerated disease because they carry the Yaa gene, a reduplication of a portion of the X chromosome that includes the TLR7 gene ( 7 ). TLR7 recognizes ssRNA, is required for the production of autoantibodies to RNA associated autoantigens ( 14 ), and appears to be responsible for much of the phenotype associated with the Yaa locus ( 4 ). Ligation of TLR7 on plasmacytoid dendritic cells is a potent stimulus for secretion of IFN? as well as other cytokines including TNF?, IL-12 and IL-6 ( 14 ). We therefore wished to know whether the accelerating effects of TLR7 overexpression could be mimicked by administration of IFN?. We first showed that the TLR7 agonist Imiquimod did not accelerate disease in female NZW/BXSB mice, consistent with the finding that optimal TLR7 agonism requires the presence of IFN? ( 15 ). In contrast, IFN? accelerated the onset of anti-cardiolipin and anti-Sm/RNP autoantibodies and caused early mortality due to nephritis. However, the IFN? treated female mice developed only mild cardiac disease and they did not become thrombocytopenic. Like male NZW/BXSB mice, the IFN? treated females had marked splenomegaly, an increase in activated B and T cells and an increase in plasma cells; however they did not lose their marginal zone B cells. Thus the loss of marginal zone B cells in male NZW/BXSB mice and in female TLR7-overexpressing mice ( 4 ) is not mediated through IFN? and may be due to a TLR7 mediated intrinsic defect in B cell selection. The differences in B cell selection between male and female mice may be one reason for the failure to develop anti-platelet antibodies and the milder anti-phospholipid syndrome in the treated females. Alternatively, TLR7 ligation induces many cytokines in addition to IFN? that may cooperatively contribute to disease phenotype and severity. Finally it is possible that other genes in the Yaa locus could contribute to a more severe disease phenotype in males. The accelerating effects of IFN? are clearly different between NZB/W and NZW/BXSB mice. In both strains IFN? recapitulates the autoantibody profile of the spontaneous disease ( 2 ) with early onset of B and T cell activation. In NZB/W mice IFN? induces abundant germinal centers, large numbers of short-lived plasma cells in the spleens with lack of expansion of these cells in the bone marrow, and high serum levels of IgG2a and IgG3 that deposit in the kidneys (Liu, submitted). In NZW/BXSB mice it accelerates the development of large germinal centers followed by splenic disorganization, similar to what is seen in males, an increase in anti-cardiolipin producing B cells in the bone marrow and an increase only in serum levels of IgG2a. These data show in sum that the effects of IFN? do not fully recapitulate the B cell or disease phenotype associated with TLR7 overexpression and that its effects on disease phenotype are strain dependent. Further characterization of effects of excess IFN? in different lupus-prone mice models and on responses of these mice to therapy will increase our understanding of the physiologic significance of the interferon signature in humans.

Together with immune mediated thrombocytopenia, inflammatory glomerulonephritis and a thrombotic vasculopathy that affects the small coronary arteries leading to myocardial infarcts, myocardial fibrosis and a dilated cardiomyopathy ( 8 , 9 , 13 ). Male mice have markedly accelerated disease because they carry the Yaa gene, a reduplication of a portion of the X chromosome that includes the TLR7 gene ( 7 ). TLR7 recognizes ssRNA, is required for the production of autoantibodies to RNA associated autoantigens ( 14 ), and appears to be responsible for much of the phenotype associated with the Yaa locus ( 4 ). Ligation of TLR7 on plasmacytoid dendritic cells is a potent stimulus for secretion of IFN? as well as other cytokines including TNF?, IL-12 and IL-6 ( 14 ). We therefore wished to know whether the accelerating effects of TLR7 overexpression could be mimicked by administration of IFN?. We first showed that the TLR7 agonist Imiquimod did not accelerate disease in female NZW/BXSB mice, consistent with the finding that optimal TLR7 agonism requires the presence of IFN? ( 15 ). In contrast, IFN? accelerated the onset of anti-cardiolipin and anti-Sm/RNP autoantibodies and caused early mortality due to nephritis. However, the IFN? treated female mice developed only mild cardiac disease and they did not become thrombocytopenic. Like male NZW/BXSB mice, the IFN? treated females had marked splenomegaly, an increase in activated B and T cells and an increase in plasma cells; however they did not lose their marginal zone B cells. Thus the loss of marginal zone B cells in male NZW/BXSB mice and in female TLR7-overexpressing mice ( 4 ) is not mediated through IFN? and may be due to a TLR7 mediated intrinsic defect in B cell selection. The differences in B cell selection between male and female mice may be one reason for the failure to develop anti-platelet antibodies and the milder anti-phospholipid syndrome in the treated females. Alternatively, TLR7 ligation induces many cytokines in addition to IFN? that may cooperatively contribute to disease phenotype and severity. Finally it is possible that other genes in the Yaa locus could contribute to a more severe disease phenotype in males. The accelerating effects of IFN? are clearly different between NZB/W and NZW/BXSB mice. In both strains IFN? recapitulates the autoantibody profile of the spontaneous disease ( 2 ) with early onset of B and T cell activation. In NZB/W mice IFN? induces abundant germinal centers, large numbers of short-lived plasma cells in the spleens with lack of expansion of these cells in the bone marrow, and high serum levels of IgG2a and IgG3 that deposit in the kidneys (Liu, submitted). In NZW/BXSB mice it accelerates the development of large germinal centers followed by splenic disorganization, similar to what is seen in males, an increase in anti-cardiolipin producing B cells in the bone marrow and an increase only in serum levels of IgG2a. These data show in sum that the effects of IFN? do not fully recapitulate the B cell or disease phenotype associated with TLR7 overexpression and that its effects on disease phenotype are strain dependent. Further characterization of effects of excess IFN? in different lupus-prone mice models and on responses of these mice to therapy will increase our understanding of the physiologic significance of the interferon signature in humans.  Figures and Table Figure 1 Panel A shows accelerated proteinuria onset and death comparable to male mice in the IFN? group vs. 22w controls (p < 0.0001 treated vs. control). Kidneys of IFN? treated mice had more intense IgG deposits in the glomeruli (1B, green) and more infiltrates of F4/80+ macrophages (1B, red) and CD11c+ dendritic cells (1D, red) than control 22w mice (1C, 1E). Images are representative of 5 mice examined per group. 17-22w IFN? treated mice had significantly more glomerular (p<0.001) and interstitial (p<0.01) damage than the control group (1F). Cardiac damage occurred in a few IFN? treated mice (1G, p < 0.09). Thrombocytopenia was not found in the IFN? treated mice (1H). Figure 2 IFN? treated mice had higher titers of autoantibodies than age matched untreated controls (2A, 2B). ELISpot analysis of spleens showed an increase in the frequency (2C) and total number (2D) of IgG and IgG anti-cardiolipin producing B cells in IFN? treated mice compared with 22w controls. Graphs show mean +/- 1 SD. Spleens of male mice stained with PNA (green) and IgD (red) showed very large germinal centers at 14w with disorganization and loss of follicular architecture and germinal centers by 17w when nephritis develops (2E and 2F respectively). Germinal centers appeared earlier in the spleens of 17w female IFN? mice (2G) than in 17w untreated controls (2H). Spleens of 22w IFN? treated mice (2I) became disorganized compared with 22w controls (2J), similar to those of sick males (2F).
