Application of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathies account for a significant portion of morbidity and mortality in patients with heart disease. The diagnosis and identification of the underlying disorder are essential for directing appropriate life-saving therapy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is an ideal method for the noninvasive evaluation of cardiomyopathies of unknown etiology. In addition, there is increasing prognostic evidence to support the use of this technology in patient risk stratification. CMR is not limited by anatomic barriers and is able to characterize tissue abnormalities that previously could often be identified only through biopsy. This review discusses the utility of CMR in the assessment of cardiomyopathies, including specific imaging techniques and their application in ischemic and nonischemic settings.  Conclusions The evaluation of cardiomyopathy can be clinically challenging. Determining the underlying pathology of disease in these conditions can direct the clinician to appropriate and possibly life-saving therapies. The application of CMR in the diagnostic evaluation of cardiomyopathy of unknown origin has been identified as an appropriate use of this technology [ 7• ]. The unique features of CMR, including exceptional temporal and spatial resolution, tissue characterization, perfusion analysis, and ability to image in any tissue plane, make it an ideal tool for use in this clinical setting. Cardiomyopathy sequencing protocols have been published to standardize and streamline the approach to the clinical scan [ 8• ]. An experienced staff can perform a thorough study within 30 minutes and provide a multimodality cardiac survey to help the clinician determine therapies that may ultimately improve patient outcomes.
