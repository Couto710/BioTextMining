CD4+ lymphocytes modulate prostate cancer progression in mice Chronic inflammation contributes to the development of prostate cancer in humans. Here, we show that male Apc Min/+ mice also develop prostate carcinoma with increasing age, mimicking that seen in humans in their 5th or 6th decade of life. Proinflammatory cytokines were significantly linked with cancer and increasing age in our mouse model; however, prostate and bowel tissues lacked evidence of inflammatory cell infiltrates other than mast cells. Lymphocytes protected against cancer, and protection from prostate cancer resided in antiinflammatory CD4+CD25+ regulatory (TREG) cells that downregulated inflammatory cytokines. Supplementation with syngeneic TREG cells collected from wild-type mice reduced the levels of interleukin (IL)-6 ( p < 0.05) and IL-9 ( p < 0.001) and lowered prostate cancer risk ( p < 0.05). Depletion of CD25+ cells in 2-month-old animals increased the expression of IL-6 ( p < 0.005) within prostate and increased the frequency of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( p < 0.05) and microinvasive prostatic carcinoma ( p < 0.05) in dorsolateral prostate. Depletion of CD25+ cells in young animals also increased the frequency of intestinal cancer in Min mice. Taken together, chronically elevated proinflammatory cytokines promoted carcinoma in Apc Min/+ mice. TREG lymphocytes downregulated inflammation-associated carcinogenic processes and contributed to immune and epithelial homeostasis.  Material and methods Experimental animals All animals were housed in AAALAC approved facilities and maintained according to protocols approved by the IACUC at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Apc Min/+ mice on a C57BL/6J background were originally obtained from the Jackson labs and bred in house as (heterozygous X wildtype ) crosses to provide Apc Min/+ mice and wildtype littermates for experimental recipients and donors. Experimental design A total of 160 mice were used for these experiments. Eighty-four Apc Min/+ mice were included in various treatment regimens or as experimental controls. Sixty C57BL/6 wild-type littermates were used as experimental animals or as cell donors for adoptive transfer experiments. Sixteen Rag2 -deficient Apc Min/+ mice housed under identical conditions were used for comparisons of prostate pathology. Experiments were conducted using separate trials with 5–8 mice each. Trials were then run in duplicate or triplicate, as noted. Adoptive transfer of T<sub>REG</sub> cells A total of 10 (5 mice per trial, 2 trials) Apc Min/+ mice aged 3.5–4 months were dosed with 3 × 105 TREG cells. CD4+CD45RBloCD25+ (TREG) lymphocytes were isolated from spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes and adoptively transferred as previously described. 37 Upon necropsy, tissues of these mice were compared to 10 (2 trials of 5 mice per trial) untreated 6-month-old Apc Min/+ mice. In a 2nd experiment, a total of 8 Rag2 -deficient Apc Min/+ mice aged 3.5–4 months were dosed with 3 × 105 TREG cells. These mice were compared to 8 untreated Rag2 -deficient Min mice at 6 months of age. The donor mice for TREG cells included male and female C57BL/6 wild-type littermate mice. The recipients used in this study were all male, in order to study prostate lesions. Depletion of CD25<sup>+</sup> cells A total of 16 (2 trials of 8 mice each) male Min mice aged 4–6 weeks were treated with anti-CD25 antibody (clone PC-61; Bio-Express, West Lebanon, NH) at 150 µg intraperitoneally per mouse 2 times weekly for 4–6 weeks. Treated mice were compared to age-matched Min mice that received sham isotype antibody alone ( N = 16). Depletion of CD25+ cells was confirmed by undetectably low fractions of CD25+ cells in spleens of 4 mice treated with anti-CD25 antibody compared to 4 sham-treated controls using flow cytometry upon completion of the study. In addition, depletion was confirmed by absence of Foxp3+ cells in target tissues, including prostatic and mesenteric lymph nodes at 42 days ( N = 8) after onset of the depletion protocol. Depletion results were then confirmed in an additional 8 anti-CD25-treated and 8 sham-treated mice at 10 days ( N = 4 mice per time point per group) and 24 days ( N = 4 mice per time point per group) after onset of treatment. Quantitation of intestinal tumors Location of tumors was recorded using a stereomicroscope at 10× magnification. Location of tumors in the small intestine was recorded as distance from the pylorus with duodenum, jejunum and ileum comprising one-third of small intestine each and in the colon as distance from cecocolic junction. 37 Detection of systemic cytokine protein expression Serum cytokine levels of 5 animals in each experimental group were analyzed using the Bioplex assay system (BioRad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturers protocol. Briefly, serum samples were diluted using the sample diluent kit, incubated with antibody coated beads followed by a secondary antibody incubation and analyzed in duplicates on a Bio-Plex 200 system (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, IL-17, IFN-gamma and G-CSF were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using 2-tailed student’s t -test; a p -value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Histologic evaluation and Immunohistochemistry As described previously, 38 the formalin-fixed tissues were processed, and tissue-sections were stained with H&E, toluidine-blue or IHC-evaluated by a veterinary pathologist blinded to sample identity. The frequency of invasive adenocarcinoma lesions in prostate 43 or bowel 44 was recorded for the various experimental groups. The preneoplastic and early neoplastic prostate lesions, which were detected based on recent consensus report criteria, 43 were quantitatively assessed as follows: From each group of mice, 30 high-power fields (20×) containing the glandular profiles that show the most advanced preneoplastic and early neoplastic lesions were captured using a Nikon eclipse 50i microscope and a Nikon DS-5 M-L1 digital camera. Ten images were randomly selected per treatment group. Lesions were then quantified and recorded as the number of low-grade PIN, high-grade PIN and microinvasive carcinoma foci counted per image. Primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry included rabbit anti- Apc , rabbit anti-?-catenin (ThermoFisher Scientific/Lab Vision, Fremont, CA), rabbit anti-E-cadherin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and mouse anti-SMA (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Antigens were retrieved with Trypsin (ThermoFisher Scientific/Lab Vision) for Apc detection. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed with citrate buffer, pH 6, for ?-catenin and E-cadherin or with EDTA buffer, pH 8, for SMA detection. Primary antibody binding was detected with goat antirabbit IgG Poly-HRP (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) or the mouse-to-mouse detection system and goat anti-mouse IgG Poly-HRP (Chemicon). Signal was detected with diaminobenzidine, and tissues were counterstained with haematoxylin. Detection of cytokine mRNA expression Total RNA from ileum tumors of Apc Min/+ mice was prepared using Trizol reagent according to the supplier’s instruction (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Five micrograms of the respective RNA was used to generate cDNA using the High Capacity Archive Kit from A/B Applied Biosystems according to the supplier’s procedure. Levels of Cox-2 , TNF-? and IL-6 transcripts in the cDNA samples were quantified with the corresponding commercial primers and probes in the ABI Prism Sequence Detection system 7700 (A/B Applied Biosystems). The levels of these cytokines among the samples were normalized by the level of the GAPDH transcripts and compared between the CD4+CD25+ TREG cells-treated and -untreated tumors by the ??Ct method described by A/B Applied Biosystems (User Bulletin #2). Statistical analyses Total prostate lesion counts and intestinal tumor counts were analyzed by unpaired t -test with Welch’s correction. For all statistical analyses, Graphpad Prism version 4.0 for windows, Graph-Pad software, San Diego, CA, USA was used.

In a 2nd experiment, a total of 8 Rag2 -deficient Apc Min/+ mice aged 3.5–4 months were dosed with 3 × 105 TREG cells. These mice were compared to 8 untreated Rag2 -deficient Min mice at 6 months of age. The donor mice for TREG cells included male and female C57BL/6 wild-type littermate mice. The recipients used in this study were all male, in order to study prostate lesions.  Depletion of CD25<sup>+</sup> cells A total of 16 (2 trials of 8 mice each) male Min mice aged 4–6 weeks were treated with anti-CD25 antibody (clone PC-61; Bio-Express, West Lebanon, NH) at 150 µg intraperitoneally per mouse 2 times weekly for 4–6 weeks.

Results Prostate carcinoma arises spontaneously in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> (Min) mice Mutations of the Apc gene have been associated with prostate cancer development in both humans 24 , 45 and mice. 25 Here, we examined male mice that undergo spontaneous loss of heterozygosity of Apc ( Apc Min/+ ) and found that unmanipulated Apc Min/+ mice between 5 and 6 months of age develop significantly ( p < 0.01) more frequent prostate cancer when compared to age-matched wildtype (wt) littermate controls housed under the same conditions (?40% in Apc Min/+ vs . 0% for the wt controls; see Table I ). Furthermore, histological features of both preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions were evident among the Apc Min/+ mice ( Fig. 1 ), while being completely absent among the wild-type controls ( Table I ). Lesions seen in Apc Min/+ mice were consistent with prostate carcinoma according to criteria of Shappell et al . in a consensus report entitled “Prostate Pathology of Genetically Engineered Mice: Definitions and Classification” published in Cancer Research , 43 and also matched prostate cancer previously described in mice with inducible inactivation of the Apc gene. 25 Prostate cancer is more frequent with increasing age In humans, prostate cancer is more common with increasing age. 3 To test whether prostate cancer frequency is associated with aging in this model, we examined male Apc Min/+ mice at 3 or 6 months of age. We discovered that Apc Min/+ male mice of age 5–6 months developed significantly more frequent prostatic microadenocarcinoma lesions than the younger 3-month-old Apc Min/+ males (compare groups in Table I , Figs. 2 and 3 ), showing that prostate disease is dependent on increasing age of the animals. We analyzed a spectrum of nonneoplastic and neoplastic proliferations, including multifocal hyperplasia with or without atypia and low-grade (LG) to high-grade (HG) prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). The HGPIN was occasionally found associating with microinvasive carcinoma. Importantly, only aged Min mice had moderately to well-differentiated adenocarcinoma accompanied by desmoplastic reaction. We also assessed signs of inflammation, and although aggregates of inflammatory cells were not observed, stroma adjacent to preneoplastic and neoplastic epithelia consistently contained mast cells and occasional neutrophils. The seminal vesicles and the anterior prostate were most frequently affected sites, followed by the dorsolateral and the ventral prostate lobes. These data indicated that Apc Min/+ mice have an age-associated predilection to spontaneously arising carcinoma in the prostate. These findings are consistent with prostate carcinoma described in mice with inducible inactivation of the Apc gene. 25 Interleukin-6 is elevated in mice with prostate cancer The pleiotropic cytokine IL-6 has been linked with the development of prostate cancer in humans. To determine whether prostate carcinoma is associated with changes in the levels of IL-6 and other cytokines in this murine model, we examined sera of Apc Min/+ mice and wt mice. We found that levels of certain cytokines in sera were indeed significantly higher in Apc Min/+ mice, a group that exhibited higher risk of carcinoma. Specifically, we observed significant elevations of IL-6 ( p < 0.01) and IL-9 ( p < 0.001) in aged Apc Min/+ mice ( Table II ; compare wt and Min mice). Additional analysis of gene expression within the prostate tissue revealed a clear increase in IL-6 ( p < 0.005) in groups of Apc Min/+ mice also prone to carcinoma, but not in wt animals ( Fig. 4 a ). Elevations in TNF -? and Cox-2 expression in prostate tissue did not reach significance (data not shown). Although both the serum cytokine levels and the tissue cytokine mRNA levels point to an association between prostate cancer and cytokines, we wished to learn more about the possibility that cytokines may actually promote cancer development. To test whether prostate cancer depends on inflammatory cytokines in Apc Min/+ mice, we neutralized a proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?, which is involved in initiation of immune activation and also amplification of other cytokines, using intraperitoneal injection of anti-TNF-?-antibodies for 10 days starting at age 20 weeks, as previously described. 27 , 38 We observed, in particular, a reduction in features of neoplastic invasion ( Table I , rows 3 and 6) in treated mice when compared to age-matched controls. This requirement of sustained inflammation for progression of neoplastic invasion has been previously shown in other murine models. 38 , 46 Lymphocytes suppress the risk of developing prostate carcinoma We next sought to determine whether or not lymphocytes, which have roles in both promoting and suppressing cancer, may be needed for prostatic neoplasia in Apc Min/+ mice. To address this question, we exploited Rag2 -deficient C57BL/6 mice to create Rag2 -defcient Apc Min/+ mice that completely lack functional lymphocytes. The lymphocyte compartment harbors cells with both pro- and anticancer functions, so it was unknown at the outset whether lack of lymphocytes would promote or suppress prostate cancer development. Interestingly, we found that Rag2 -deficient Apc Min/+ mice aged 5–6 months developed more frequent neoplastic features in the prostate gland ( Fig. 1 ) when compared to age-matched Apc Min/+ controls that were housed under the same conditions ( Table I ; Fig. 3 ). Qualitatively, however, the spectrum of prostatic lesions tabulated in aged Rag2 -deficient Apc Min/+ mice was similar to that of Apc Min/+ mice (shown in Fig. 1 ). One exception was that Rag2 -deficient Apc Min/+ prostate stroma had a more prominent edematous alteration and a greater frequency of mast cells. Mast cells ( Figs. 1 e and 1 f ) were a frequent feature of malignancy in this model. We have previously shown that TNF-?-dependent activities of mast cells are essential for intestinal polyp development in Apc Min/+ mice. 47 Significant elevations of IL-6 ( p < 0.05) and IL-9 ( p < 0.001) were observed in Apc Min/+ mice ( Table II ). Use of the Rag2 -deficient host highlights the innate immune contributions toward IL-6 in prostate tissue in Apc Min/+ mice and role for these cells in subsequent pathogenic events in humans and mice. 48 Taken together, it is clear that lymphocytes are not absolutely required for prostate tumorigenesis in the Apc Min/+ mouse model, an observation that is consistent with earlier studies. 27 The observation of increased invasive prostate lesions in Rag2 -deficient Apc Min/+ mice when compared to their Apc Min/+ counterparts ( Table I ; Fig. 3 ) indicates that lymphocytes are among cells that protect against malignancy. On the basis of prior data derived from Apc Min/+ mice, 27 , 37 , 46 , 47 we postulated that CD4+ TREG cells may function to maintain immune homeostasis and inhibit prostate cancer in Apc Min/+ mice. CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>REG</sub> cells inhibit prostate carcinogenesis Having observed that prostatic neoplasia was exacerbated by a deficiency in lymphocytes, we wondered whether supplementation with TREG cells might inhibit developing prostate cancer in Rag2 ?/? Apc Min/+ mice. The Rag2 ?/? Apc Min/+ mice permit direct assessment of the impact of adoptively transferred CD4+CD45RBloCD25+ TREG in the complete absence of endogenous TREG cells or other lymphocytes. Highly purified TREG cells derived from wild-type cell donors were adoptively transferred into 14-week-old Rag2 ?/?Apc Min/+ mice. We found that recipients of TREG cells examined 8 weeks later, at 5–6 months of age, had a significant ( p < 0.01) reduction in prostate pathology ( N = 8; Fig. 3 ), in cytokine levels of TNF-? ( p < 0.05), IL-6 ( p < 0.05) and IL-9 ( p < 0.005) in the serum ( Table II ), and in cytokine expression levels in the prostate tissue ( p < 0.01) ( Fig. 4 a ) when compared to untreated Rag2 ?/?Apc Min/+ mice. Taken together, these data provide evidence that TREG cells alone, when collected from immune-competent donors, are sufficient for inhibition of prostate cancer. We next examined whether supplementation with TREG cells might inhibit progression of developing prostate cancer in Apc Min/+ mice that have endogenous lymphocytes. To test this possibility, 10 4- to 5-month-old male Apc Min/+ mice underwent adoptive transfer of TREG cells from syngeneic wildtype ( wt ) donors. Despite the fact that the recipient mice already had TREG cells present, we nevertheless observed a significant ( p < 0.05) reduction in prostate pathology in TREG-treated mice ( N = 10, with 2 trials of 5 mice per trial; see Table I , Fig. 3 ). Examination of bowel from the same treated and untreated Apc Min/+ mice showed a significant ( p < 0.01) reduction in intestinal adenoma multiplicity ( N = 10; µ = 18 ± 3.68) in Apc Min/+ recipients of TREG cells when compared to untreated Apc Min/+ mice ( N = 10; µ = 36 ± 5.40). These data, taken together with prior studies, 27 , 46 , 49 support an essential protective role for TREG cells of immune-competent animals in maintenance of epithelial homeostasis and prevention of cancer. Depletion of CD25<sup>+</sup> cells accelerates progression of prostate carcinogenesis Finally, we tested whether depletion of TREG cells may alter development of prostate cancer. We reasoned that if TREG are critical in preventing development of prostate cancer, then removing them from young mice should increase cancer risk later in life. 37 , 38 Our lab 38 and others 31 have previously shown that both CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25+ subsets of TREG cells exhibit potent antiinflammatory properties in mice. For these experiments, we performed depletion of the CD25+ subset of TREG cells using antibodies against CD25. We depleted CD25+ cells in Apc Min/+ mice (2 trials; total N = 16) using anti-CD25 antibody injection starting at 6–8 weeks of age, before immune dysregulations are known to arise. 50 Upon completion, we confirmed depletion by determining the fraction of CD25+ cells among splenocytes using flow cytometry, as well as inability to detect Foxp3+ cells in target tissues (prostatic lymph and mesenteric nodes) in situ using IHC (data not shown). Afterward, comparisons of CD25+ depleted and sham IgG-treated animals showed that there was a significant ( p < 0.01) increase in prostate lesion frequency after depletion of CD25 when compared to either the sham antibody-treated or the unmanipulated age-matched Apc Min/+ mice ( Table I ). Severity and progression of PIN and microinvasive carcinoma in male Min mice that had undergone CD25 depletion matched those of Apc Min/+ mice of much more advanced age (compare in Table I : 3-month-old Apc Min/+ undergoing CD25 depletion versus 6-month-old Apc Min/+ mice). The frequency of preneoplastic foci within prostate tissue arose rapidly after depletion of CD25+ cells ( Table I ) and were clearly correlated with disruption of ?-catenin and E-cadherin ( Fig. 5 ). In general, loss of the Apc gene predisposed to decline in the normal lateral epithelial cell membrane staining pattern of E-cadherin (as shown in Fig. 5 e ) and ?-catenin (as shown in Fig. 5 g ). The immunohistochemical signal of E-cadherin progressively attenuated ( Fig. 5 f ) as the lesions progressed from LGPIN to prostate adeno-carcinoma. The abnormal and intense cytoplasmic (as with PIN, Fig. 5 h ), or both cytoplasmic and nuclear (as with adenocarcinoma, Fig. 1 f ) stabilization of ?-catenin typified prostate neoplasia in Apc Min/+ mice. Gene expression analyses of prostate tissue after depletion of CD25+ cells also revealed increased expression of IL-6 when compared to age-matched sham-treated mice ( p < 0.0001) ( Fig. 4 a ). On the basis of these findings, we constructed a continuum of inflammation-associated prostate pathology in Apc Min/+ mice (see Fig. 3 b –3 e ), progressing from LGPIN to prostatic adenocarcinoma. Upon comparison between all groups, it was Rag2 -deficient Apc Min/+ mice that developed the highest frequency of advanced adenocarcinoma and invasive lesions ( Table I and Fig. 3 ). The most advanced types of adenocarcinoma lesions were infrequent in 3-month-old Apc Min/+ mice, even after they had undergone CD25 depletion for 30–45 days. In general, however, carcinogenesis, including high-grade PIN ( p < 0.01) and microinvasive adenocarcinoma ( p < 0.05), was accelerated by depletion of antiinflammatory CD25+ cells in Apc Min/+ mice ( Table I and Fig. 3 ). Depletion of CD25<sup>+</sup> cells increased frequency of intestinal ampullary tumors in the duodenal papilla of Vater ApcMin/+ mice are a widely applied and well-established model for intestinal carcinogenesis because of their inherent susceptibility to intestinal tumorigenesis. The Apc mutation is an early event in 80% of sporadic intestinal cancers in humans, 51 , 52 and the Apc Min/+ mouse has been frequently used for study of familial intestinal adenomatous polyposis (FAP) in humans. 21 , 22 To examine whether the carcinogenic effect of CD25+ cell depletion might also affect other types of cancers, we inspected intestinal tissues of the same Apc Min/+ mice used for prostate cancer analyses: 8 males (2 trials; total N = 16, as described earlier) with the depletion protocol starting at 6–8 weeks of age. As previously described for the study of prostate, mice had been treated with anti-CD25 antibodies for 4 weeks starting at 4–6 weeks of age, alongside sham IgG-treated age-matched controls. As we found for prostate cancer, Apc Min/+ mice treated with anti-CD25 antibody had an increased susceptibility to development of intestinal carcinoma. Specifically, we observed an increased frequency of ampullary cancer of the duodenal papillae of Vater in 25% (2/8) of mice treated with anti-CD25 ( Fig. 6 ). This type of ampullary cancer was not observed even after extensive examination of untreated Apc Min/+ mice of all ages. Lesions were comprised of variably sized duct profiles with abnormal contours that infiltrated duodenal mucosa and the muscular coat of the pancreatic duct. Ductal epithelia lacking goblet cells were pseudostratified and highly atypical. Also, we found that mice that had been treated with anti-CD25 antibody showed signs of increased inflammation; we observed a desmoplastic and inflammatory reaction, characterized mainly by neutrophils and macrophages prominent within ampullary cancer lesions. Histologic features of the tumor matched those of human patients 53 and also those previously described in compound mutant Apc Min/+ and SMAD4 -deficient mice. 54 Mast cells were a frequent feature in invasive intestinal lesions ( Fig. 6 b ). We hypothesized that accelerated carcinogenesis was due to unmitigated inflammatory response and upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in intestinal tissues after depletion of CD25+ cells. We next examined whether proinflammatory cytokines were upregulated in bowel tissue after depletion of CD25+ cells. Upon analysis of snap frozen ileum tissue, we found that anti-CD25-treated Apc Min/+ mice had significantly ( p < 0.01) increased levels of IL-6 gene expression in tissue after depletion of CD25+ cells when compared to tissue of sham-treated age-matched controls ( Fig. 4 b ). Gene expression of Cox-2 ( Fig. 4 b ) was also significantly increased when compared to sham IgG-treated counterparts. These findings match data from humans showing that cancer risk in the prostate and bowel is reduced after Cox-2 inhibitor therapy. 13 – 15 Taken together, the results of the CD25-depletion studies support that antiinflammatory CD25+ TREG cells significantly inhibit carcinogenesis in Apc Min/+ mice.

To test whether prostate cancer depends on inflammatory cytokines in Apc Min/+ mice, we neutralized a proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?, which is involved in initiation of immune activation and also amplification of other cytokines, using intraperitoneal injection of anti-TNF-?-antibodies for 10 days starting at age 20 weeks, as previously described. 27 , 38 We observed, in particular, a reduction in features of neoplastic invasion ( Table I , rows 3 and 6) in treated mice when compared to age-matched controls. This requirement of sustained inflammation for progression of neoplastic invasion has been previously shown in other murine models. 38 , 46 Lymphocytes suppress the risk of developing prostate carcinoma We next sought to determine whether or not lymphocytes, which have roles in both promoting and suppressing cancer, may be needed for prostatic neoplasia in Apc Min/+ mice. To address this question, we exploited Rag2 -deficient C57BL/6 mice to create Rag2 -defcient Apc Min/+ mice that completely lack functional lymphocytes. The lymphocyte compartment harbors cells with both pro- and anticancer functions, so it was unknown at the outset whether lack of lymphocytes would promote or suppress prostate cancer development. Interestingly, we found that Rag2 -deficient Apc Min/+ mice aged 5–6 months developed more frequent neoplastic features in the prostate gland ( Fig. 1 ) when compared to age-matched Apc Min/+ controls that were housed under the same conditions ( Table I ; Fig. 3 ). Qualitatively, however, the spectrum of prostatic lesions tabulated in aged Rag2 -deficient Apc Min/+ mice was similar to that of Apc Min/+ mice (shown in Fig. 1 ). One exception was that Rag2 -deficient Apc Min/+ prostate stroma had a more prominent edematous alteration and a greater frequency of mast cells. Mast cells ( Figs. 1 e and 1 f ) were a frequent feature of malignancy in this model. We have previously shown that TNF-?-dependent activities of mast cells are essential for intestinal polyp development in Apc Min/+ mice. 47 Significant elevations of IL-6 ( p < 0.05) and IL-9 ( p < 0.001) were observed in Apc Min/+ mice ( Table II ). Use of the Rag2 -deficient host highlights the innate immune contributions toward IL-6 in prostate tissue in Apc Min/+ mice and role for these cells in subsequent pathogenic events in humans and mice. 48 Taken together, it is clear that lymphocytes are not absolutely required for prostate tumorigenesis in the Apc Min/+ mouse model, an observation that is consistent with earlier studies. 27 The observation of increased invasive prostate lesions in Rag2 -deficient Apc Min/+ mice when compared to their Apc Min/+ counterparts ( Table I ; Fig. 3 ) indicates that lymphocytes are among cells that protect against malignancy. On the basis of prior data derived from Apc Min/+ mice, 27 , 37 , 46 , 47 we postulated that CD4+ TREG cells may function to maintain immune homeostasis and inhibit prostate cancer in Apc Min/+ mice. CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>REG</sub> cells inhibit prostate carcinogenesis Having observed that prostatic neoplasia was exacerbated by a deficiency in lymphocytes, we wondered whether supplementation with TREG cells might inhibit developing prostate cancer in Rag2 ?/? Apc Min/+ mice. The Rag2 ?/? Apc Min/+ mice permit direct assessment of the impact of adoptively transferred CD4+CD45RBloCD25+ TREG in the complete absence of endogenous TREG cells or other lymphocytes. Highly purified TREG cells derived from wild-type cell donors were adoptively transferred into 14-week-old Rag2 ?/?Apc Min/+ mice. We found that recipients of TREG cells examined 8 weeks later, at 5–6 months of age, had a significant ( p < 0.01) reduction in prostate pathology ( N = 8; Fig. 3 ), in cytokine levels of TNF-? ( p < 0.05), IL-6 ( p < 0.05) and IL-9 ( p < 0.005) in the serum ( Table II ), and in cytokine expression levels in the prostate tissue ( p < 0.01) ( Fig. 4 a ) when compared to untreated Rag2 ?/?Apc Min/+ mice. Taken together, these data provide evidence that TREG cells alone, when collected from immune-competent donors, are sufficient for inhibition of prostate cancer. We next examined whether supplementation with TREG cells might inhibit progression of developing prostate cancer in Apc Min/+ mice that have endogenous lymphocytes. To test this possibility, 10 4- to 5-month-old male Apc Min/+ mice underwent adoptive transfer of TREG cells from syngeneic wildtype ( wt ) donors. Despite the fact that the recipient mice already had TREG cells present, we nevertheless observed a significant ( p < 0.05) reduction in prostate pathology in TREG-treated mice ( N = 10, with 2 trials of 5 mice per trial; see Table I , Fig. 3 ). Examination of bowel from the same treated and untreated Apc Min/+ mice showed a significant ( p < 0.01) reduction in intestinal adenoma multiplicity ( N = 10; µ = 18 ± 3.68) in Apc Min/+ recipients of TREG cells when compared to untreated Apc Min/+ mice ( N = 10; µ = 36 ± 5.40). These data, taken together with prior studies, 27 , 46 , 49 support an essential protective role for TREG cells of immune-competent animals in maintenance of epithelial homeostasis and prevention of cancer. Depletion of CD25<sup>+</sup> cells accelerates progression of prostate carcinogenesis Finally, we tested whether depletion of TREG cells may alter development of prostate cancer. We reasoned that if TREG are critical in preventing development of prostate cancer, then removing them from young mice should increase cancer risk later in life. 37 , 38 Our lab 38 and others 31 have previously shown that both CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25+ subsets of TREG cells exhibit potent antiinflammatory properties in mice. For these experiments, we performed depletion of the CD25+ subset of TREG cells using antibodies against CD25. We depleted CD25+ cells in Apc Min/+ mice (2 trials; total N = 16) using anti-CD25 antibody injection starting at 6–8 weeks of age, before immune dysregulations are known to arise. 50 Upon completion, we confirmed depletion by determining the fraction of CD25+ cells among splenocytes using flow cytometry, as well as inability to detect Foxp3+ cells in target tissues (prostatic lymph and mesenteric nodes) in situ using IHC (data not shown). Afterward, comparisons of CD25+ depleted and sham IgG-treated animals showed that there was a significant ( p < 0.01) increase in prostate lesion frequency after depletion of CD25 when compared to either the sham antibody-treated or the unmanipulated age-matched Apc Min/+ mice ( Table I ). Severity and progression of PIN and microinvasive carcinoma in male Min mice that had undergone CD25 depletion matched those of Apc Min/+ mice of much more advanced age (compare in Table I : 3-month-old Apc Min/+ undergoing CD25 depletion versus 6-month-old Apc Min/+ mice). The frequency of preneoplastic foci within prostate tissue arose rapidly after depletion of CD25+ cells ( Table I ) and were clearly correlated with disruption of ?-catenin and E-cadherin ( Fig. 5 ). In general, loss of the Apc gene predisposed to decline in the normal lateral epithelial cell membrane staining pattern of E-cadherin (as shown in Fig. 5 e ) and ?-catenin (as shown in Fig. 5 g ). The immunohistochemical signal of E-cadherin progressively attenuated ( Fig. 5 f ) as the lesions progressed from LGPIN to prostate adeno-carcinoma. The abnormal and intense cytoplasmic (as with PIN, Fig. 5 h ), or both cytoplasmic and nuclear (as with adenocarcinoma, Fig. 1 f ) stabilization of ?-catenin typified prostate neoplasia in Apc Min/+ mice. Gene expression analyses of prostate tissue after depletion of CD25+ cells also revealed increased expression of IL-6 when compared to age-matched sham-treated mice ( p < 0.0001) ( Fig. 4 a ). On the basis of these findings, we constructed a continuum of inflammation-associated prostate pathology in Apc Min/+ mice (see Fig. 3 b –3 e ), progressing from LGPIN to prostatic adenocarcinoma. Upon comparison between all groups, it was Rag2 -deficient Apc Min/+ mice that developed the highest frequency of advanced adenocarcinoma and invasive lesions ( Table I and Fig. 3 ). The most advanced types of adenocarcinoma lesions were infrequent in 3-month-old Apc Min/+ mice, even after they had undergone CD25 depletion for 30–45 days. In general, however, carcinogenesis, including high-grade PIN ( p < 0.01) and microinvasive adenocarcinoma ( p < 0.05), was accelerated by depletion of antiinflammatory CD25+ cells in Apc Min/+ mice ( Table I and Fig. 3 ). Depletion of CD25<sup>+</sup> cells increased frequency of intestinal ampullary tumors in the duodenal papilla of Vater ApcMin/+ mice are a widely applied and well-established model for intestinal carcinogenesis because of their inherent susceptibility to intestinal tumorigenesis. The Apc mutation is an early event in 80% of sporadic intestinal cancers in humans, 51 , 52 and the Apc Min/+ mouse has been frequently used for study of familial intestinal adenomatous polyposis (FAP) in humans. 21 , 22 To examine whether the carcinogenic effect of CD25+ cell depletion might also affect other types of cancers, we inspected intestinal tissues of the same Apc Min/+ mice used for prostate cancer analyses: 8 males (2 trials; total N = 16, as described earlier) with the depletion protocol starting at 6–8 weeks of age. As previously described for the study of prostate, mice had been treated with anti-CD25 antibodies for 4 weeks starting at 4–6 weeks of age, alongside sham IgG-treated age-matched controls. As we found for prostate cancer, Apc Min/+ mice treated with anti-CD25 antibody had an increased susceptibility to development of intestinal carcinoma. Specifically, we observed an increased frequency of ampullary cancer of the duodenal papillae of Vater in 25% (2/8) of mice treated with anti-CD25 ( Fig. 6 ). This type of ampullary cancer was not observed even after extensive examination of untreated Apc Min/+ mice of all ages. Lesions were comprised of variably sized duct profiles with abnormal contours that infiltrated duodenal mucosa and the muscular coat of the pancreatic duct. Ductal epithelia lacking goblet cells were pseudostratified and highly atypical. Also, we found that mice that had been treated with anti-CD25 antibody showed signs of increased inflammation; we observed a desmoplastic and inflammatory reaction, characterized mainly by neutrophils and macrophages prominent within ampullary cancer lesions. Histologic features of the tumor matched those of human patients 53 and also those previously described in compound mutant Apc Min/+ and SMAD4 -deficient mice. 54 Mast cells were a frequent feature in invasive intestinal lesions ( Fig. 6 b ). We hypothesized that accelerated carcinogenesis was due to unmitigated inflammatory response and upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in intestinal tissues after depletion of CD25+ cells. We next examined whether proinflammatory cytokines were upregulated in bowel tissue after depletion of CD25+ cells. Upon analysis of snap frozen ileum tissue, we found that anti-CD25-treated Apc Min/+ mice had significantly ( p < 0.01) increased levels of IL-6 gene expression in tissue after depletion of CD25+ cells when compared to tissue of sham-treated age-matched controls ( Fig. 4 b ). Gene expression of Cox-2 ( Fig. 4 b ) was also significantly increased when compared to sham IgG-treated counterparts. These findings match data from humans showing that cancer risk in the prostate and bowel is reduced after Cox-2 inhibitor therapy. 13 – 15 Taken together, the results of the CD25-depletion studies support that antiinflammatory CD25+ TREG cells significantly inhibit carcinogenesis in Apc Min/+ mice.  Prostate carcinoma arises spontaneously in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> (Min) mice Mutations of the Apc gene have been associated with prostate cancer development in both humans 24 , 45 and mice. 25 Here, we examined male mice that undergo spontaneous loss of heterozygosity of Apc ( Apc Min/+ ) and found that unmanipulated Apc Min/+ mice between 5 and 6 months of age develop significantly ( p < 0.01) more frequent prostate cancer when compared to age-matched wildtype (wt) littermate controls housed under the same conditions (?40% in Apc Min/+ vs . 0% for the wt controls; see Table I ). Furthermore, histological features of both preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions were evident among the Apc Min/+ mice ( Fig. 1 ), while being completely absent among the wild-type controls ( Table I ). Lesions seen in Apc Min/+ mice were consistent with prostate carcinoma according to criteria of Shappell et al . in a consensus report entitled “Prostate Pathology of Genetically Engineered Mice: Definitions and Classification” published in Cancer Research , 43 and also matched prostate cancer previously described in mice with inducible inactivation of the Apc gene. 25  Prostate carcinoma arises spontaneously in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> (Min) mice Mutations of the Apc gene have been associated with prostate cancer development in both humans 24 , 45 and mice. 25 Here, we examined male mice that undergo spontaneous loss of heterozygosity of Apc ( Apc Min/+ ) and found that unmanipulated Apc Min/+ mice between 5 and 6 months of age develop significantly ( p < 0.01) more frequent prostate cancer when compared to age-matched wildtype (wt) littermate controls housed under the same conditions (?40% in Apc Min/+ vs . 0% for the wt controls; see Table I ).

We discovered that Apc Min/+ male mice of age 5–6 months developed significantly more frequent prostatic microadenocarcinoma lesions than the younger 3-month-old Apc Min/+ males (compare groups in Table I , Figs. 2 and 3 ), showing that prostate disease is dependent on increasing age of the animals. We analyzed a spectrum of nonneoplastic and neoplastic proliferations, including multifocal hyperplasia with or without atypia and low-grade (LG) to high-grade (HG) prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). The HGPIN was occasionally found associating with microinvasive carcinoma. Importantly, only aged Min mice had moderately to well-differentiated adenocarcinoma accompanied by desmoplastic reaction. We also assessed signs of inflammation, and although aggregates of inflammatory cells were not observed, stroma adjacent to preneoplastic and neoplastic epithelia consistently contained mast cells and occasional neutrophils. The seminal vesicles and the anterior prostate were most frequently affected sites, followed by the dorsolateral and the ventral prostate lobes. These data indicated that Apc Min/+ mice have an age-associated predilection to spontaneously arising carcinoma in the prostate. These findings are consistent with prostate carcinoma described in mice with inducible inactivation of the Apc gene. 25  Prostate cancer is more frequent with increasing age In humans, prostate cancer is more common with increasing age. 3 To test whether prostate cancer frequency is associated with aging in this model, we examined male Apc Min/+ mice at 3 or 6 months of age.

These findings are consistent with prostate carcinoma described in mice with inducible inactivation of the Apc gene. 25  Interleukin-6 is elevated in mice with prostate cancer The pleiotropic cytokine IL-6 has been linked with the development of prostate cancer in humans. To determine whether prostate carcinoma is associated with changes in the levels of IL-6 and other cytokines in this murine model, we examined sera of Apc Min/+ mice and wt mice. We found that levels of certain cytokines in sera were indeed significantly higher in Apc Min/+ mice, a group that exhibited higher risk of carcinoma. Specifically, we observed significant elevations of IL-6 ( p < 0.01) and IL-9 ( p < 0.001) in aged Apc Min/+ mice ( Table II ; compare wt and Min mice). Additional analysis of gene expression within the prostate tissue revealed a clear increase in IL-6 ( p < 0.005) in groups of Apc Min/+ mice also prone to carcinoma, but not in wt animals ( Fig. 4 a ). Elevations in TNF -? and Cox-2 expression in prostate tissue did not reach significance (data not shown). Although both the serum cytokine levels and the tissue cytokine mRNA levels point to an association between prostate cancer and cytokines, we wished to learn more about the possibility that cytokines may actually promote cancer development.

We found that recipients of TREG cells examined 8 weeks later, at 5–6 months of age, had a significant ( p < 0.01) reduction in prostate pathology ( N = 8; Fig. 3 ), in cytokine levels of TNF-? ( p < 0.05), IL-6 ( p < 0.05) and IL-9 ( p < 0.005) in the serum ( Table II ), and in cytokine expression levels in the prostate tissue ( p < 0.01) ( Fig. 4 a ) when compared to untreated Rag2 ?/?Apc Min/+ mice.

We depleted CD25+ cells in Apc Min/+ mice (2 trials; total N = 16) using anti-CD25 antibody injection starting at 6–8 weeks of age, before immune dysregulations are known to arise. 50 Upon completion, we confirmed depletion by determining the fraction of CD25+ cells among splenocytes using flow cytometry, as well as inability to detect Foxp3+ cells in target tissues (prostatic lymph and mesenteric nodes) in situ using IHC (data not shown). Afterward, comparisons of CD25+ depleted and sham IgG-treated animals showed that there was a significant ( p < 0.01) increase in prostate lesion frequency after depletion of CD25 when compared to either the sham antibody-treated or the unmanipulated age-matched Apc Min/+ mice ( Table I ). Severity and progression of PIN and microinvasive carcinoma in male Min mice that had undergone CD25 depletion matched those of Apc Min/+ mice of much more advanced age (compare in Table I : 3-month-old Apc Min/+ undergoing CD25 depletion versus 6-month-old Apc Min/+ mice). The frequency of preneoplastic foci within prostate tissue arose rapidly after depletion of CD25+ cells ( Table I ) and were clearly correlated with disruption of ?-catenin and E-cadherin ( Fig. 5 ). In general, loss of the Apc gene predisposed to decline in the normal lateral epithelial cell membrane staining pattern of E-cadherin (as shown in Fig. 5 e ) and ?-catenin (as shown in Fig. 5 g ). The immunohistochemical signal of E-cadherin progressively attenuated ( Fig. 5 f ) as the lesions progressed from LGPIN to prostate adeno-carcinoma. The abnormal and intense cytoplasmic (as with PIN, Fig. 5 h ), or both cytoplasmic and nuclear (as with adenocarcinoma, Fig. 1 f ) stabilization of ?-catenin typified prostate neoplasia in Apc Min/+ mice. Gene expression analyses of prostate tissue after depletion of CD25+ cells also revealed increased expression of IL-6 when compared to age-matched sham-treated mice ( p < 0.0001) ( Fig. 4 a ). On the basis of these findings, we constructed a continuum of inflammation-associated prostate pathology in Apc Min/+ mice (see Fig. 3 b –3 e ), progressing from LGPIN to prostatic adenocarcinoma. Upon comparison between all groups, it was Rag2 -deficient Apc Min/+ mice that developed the highest frequency of advanced adenocarcinoma and invasive lesions ( Table I and Fig. 3 ). The most advanced types of adenocarcinoma lesions were infrequent in 3-month-old Apc Min/+ mice, even after they had undergone CD25 depletion for 30–45 days. In general, however, carcinogenesis, including high-grade PIN ( p < 0.01) and microinvasive adenocarcinoma ( p < 0.05), was accelerated by depletion of antiinflammatory CD25+ cells in Apc Min/+ mice ( Table I and Fig. 3 ).  Depletion of CD25<sup>+</sup> cells increased frequency of intestinal ampullary tumors in the duodenal papilla of Vater ApcMin/+ mice are a widely applied and well-established model for intestinal carcinogenesis because of their inherent susceptibility to intestinal tumorigenesis. The Apc mutation is an early event in 80% of sporadic intestinal cancers in humans, 51 , 52 and the Apc Min/+ mouse has been frequently used for study of familial intestinal adenomatous polyposis (FAP) in humans. 21 , 22 To examine whether the carcinogenic effect of CD25+ cell depletion might also affect other types of cancers, we inspected intestinal tissues of the same Apc Min/+ mice used for prostate cancer analyses: 8 males (2 trials; total N = 16, as described earlier) with the depletion protocol starting at 6–8 weeks of age. As previously described for the study of prostate, mice had been treated with anti-CD25 antibodies for 4 weeks starting at 4–6 weeks of age, alongside sham IgG-treated age-matched controls. As we found for prostate cancer, Apc Min/+ mice treated with anti-CD25 antibody had an increased susceptibility to development of intestinal carcinoma. Specifically, we observed an increased frequency of ampullary cancer of the duodenal papillae of Vater in 25% (2/8) of mice treated with anti-CD25 ( Fig. 6 ). This type of ampullary cancer was not observed even after extensive examination of untreated Apc Min/+ mice of all ages. Lesions were comprised of variably sized duct profiles with abnormal contours that infiltrated duodenal mucosa and the muscular coat of the pancreatic duct. Ductal epithelia lacking goblet cells were pseudostratified and highly atypical. Also, we found that mice that had been treated with anti-CD25 antibody showed signs of increased inflammation; we observed a desmoplastic and inflammatory reaction, characterized mainly by neutrophils and macrophages prominent within ampullary cancer lesions. Histologic features of the tumor matched those of human patients 53 and also those previously described in compound mutant Apc Min/+ and SMAD4 -deficient mice. 54 Mast cells were a frequent feature in invasive intestinal lesions ( Fig. 6 b ). We hypothesized that accelerated carcinogenesis was due to unmitigated inflammatory response and upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in intestinal tissues after depletion of CD25+ cells. We next examined whether proinflammatory cytokines were upregulated in bowel tissue after depletion of CD25+ cells. Upon analysis of snap frozen ileum tissue, we found that anti-CD25-treated Apc Min/+ mice had significantly ( p < 0.01) increased levels of IL-6 gene expression in tissue after depletion of CD25+ cells when compared to tissue of sham-treated age-matched controls ( Fig. 4 b ). Gene expression of Cox-2 ( Fig. 4 b ) was also significantly increased when compared to sham IgG-treated counterparts. These findings match data from humans showing that cancer risk in the prostate and bowel is reduced after Cox-2 inhibitor therapy. 13 – 15 Taken together, the results of the CD25-depletion studies support that antiinflammatory CD25+ TREG cells significantly inhibit carcinogenesis in Apc Min/+ mice.  Depletion of CD25<sup>+</sup> cells increased frequency of intestinal ampullary tumors in the duodenal papilla of Vater ApcMin/+ mice are a widely applied and well-established model for intestinal carcinogenesis because of their inherent susceptibility to intestinal tumorigenesis.

We hypothesized that accelerated carcinogenesis was due to unmitigated inflammatory response and upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in intestinal tissues after depletion of CD25+ cells. We next examined whether proinflammatory cytokines were upregulated in bowel tissue after depletion of CD25+ cells. Upon analysis of snap frozen ileum tissue, we found that anti-CD25-treated Apc Min/+ mice had significantly ( p < 0.01) increased levels of IL-6 gene expression in tissue after depletion of CD25+ cells when compared to tissue of sham-treated age-matched controls ( Fig. 4 b ). Gene expression of Cox-2 ( Fig. 4 b ) was also significantly increased when compared to sham IgG-treated counterparts. These findings match data from humans showing that cancer risk in the prostate and bowel is reduced after Cox-2 inhibitor therapy. 13 – 15 Taken together, the results of the CD25-depletion studies support that antiinflammatory CD25+ TREG cells significantly inhibit carcinogenesis in Apc Min/+ mice.  Discussion These studies demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge that male Apc Min/+ mice exhibit features of neoplasia in the prostate. Untreated Apc Min/+ mice developed age-associated prostate lesions with a high frequency of HGPIN and microadenocarcinoma resembling prostate cancer in humans. These findings were consistent with prostate carcinoma described in mice with inducible inactivation of the Apc gene. 25 Overt inflammatory disease was not a feature of cancer; however, factors previously linked with prostate cancer in men, i.e ., IL-6, were significantly associated with development of carcinoma in this mouse model. In this model, CD4+ TREG cells inhibited development of prostate carcinoma, at least in part because of downregulation of IL-6 and IL-9 cytokine expression. Not only did supplementation of purified CD4+ Treg cells from immune-competent donors serve to inhibit cancer development, but also the inverse was demonstrated when carcinoma frequency was increased after depletion of CD25+ cells in young mice. Data shown in Table I and Figure 5 after depletion of CD25+ cells were consistent with observations of Bruxvoort et al . showing that loss of the Apc gene leads to disruption of ?-catenin and E-cadherin during development of prostatic adenocarcinoma in mice. 25 Among genetic factors contributing to cancer, nearly 85% of sporadic colon cancers and 15% of prostate cancers in humans have been linked with inactivation of the Apc gene. Alterations in ?-catenin and the wnt signaling pathway have also been correlated with advanced prostate cancer in humans. 24 , 55 Development of cancer was coincident with abnormalities in ?-catenin and E-cadherin in prostatic epithelia (see Results Figs. 1 and 5 ). These findings support data from other mouse models implicating ?-catenin 25 , 56 and E-cadherin 57 in prostate carcinogenesis, and match earlier findings in humans. 58 , 59 Disruption of cytoskeletal complexes because of reduction in E-cadherin is postulated to contribute to the loss of tissue architecture 60 and has relevancy to human prostate health and disease. 25 Although recent data involving protective versus destructive roles for TREG cells in cancer appear contradictory on the surface, 39 – 42 we postulate that function of TREG depends on the age of the animal and context within the microenvironment of the animal. In young and immune-competent animals, TREG cells actually serve an important protective role against cancer by maintaining immune homeostasis and constructively regulating levels of TNF-?, IL-6, IL-17 and IL-9 that when dysregulated may contribute to cancer growth. In support of this, data in Table II show that levels of TNF-?, IL-6 and IL-9 are significantly lowered when exogenous TREG cells are added in young mice. Likewise, targeted depletion of CD25 leads to upregulation of cytokines such as IL-6 ( p < 0.001) in prostate (see Fig. 4 ; groups undergoing CD25 cell depletion) and contribute to onset of cancer. Inability to properly regulate IL-6 was shown in other models to divert homeostatic functions of CD4+ cells toward a destructive Th17 pathway that may contribute to cancer growth. 48 , 61 We propose that this process can be interrupted to benefit the host by downregulation of inflammation (as with anti-TNF) or by supplementation with exogenous TREG cells collected from immune competent wt hosts. 27 , 38 , 46 , 62 Reenforcement of the antiinflammatory arm of immunity with TREG cells significantly ( p < 0.05) reduces levels of IL-6 in mice (see Table II ). Depletion of CD25+ cells in 2- to 3-month-old mice was shown here to increase the rate of prostatic neoplasia that arose spontaneously at a later age of 5–6 months in untreated Apc Min/+ mice (see Table I ). One interesting question raised by these data is whether Apc Min/+ mice have an intrinsic defect that diminishes ability of resident TREG cells to prevent prostatic and bowel cancer. One possible explanation is that the growing intestinal tumor burden increases levels of TNF-? and IL-6 that subsequently accelerate a Th-17-driven spiral of TREG-mediated events that subsequently contribute to cancer growth. 49 , 50 , 63 An alternative interpretation in this “chicken-and-egg” scenario is that thymic depletion, evident at 90 days of age in Apc Min/+ mice, 50 may lead to widespread immune dysfunction predisposing to elevated IL-6 that increases cancer risk. By this 2nd way of thinking, immune impairment arises first and then allows for increased levels of TNF-? and IL-6 that impede TREG homeostatic capabilities. 48 In either event, maintenance of immune homeostasis is disrupted in the Apc Min/+ mice, providing an opportunity to dissect roles for cytokines that may contribute to cancer growth. In this setting, supplemental CD4+ TREG cells collected from immune competent donors would, at least initially, be untainted by high levels of IL-6 within the tumor microenvironment. Our experimental depletion of CD25+ cells started at 30–45 days of age, preceding the natural onset of thymic involution in Apc Min/+ mice. 50 Importantly, at 30– 45 days of age, prostatic neoplasia was otherwise nearly nonexistent in untreated male Apc Min/+ mice ( Table I ). Thus, removal of CD25+ cells greatly hastened the onset of cancer in an animal otherwise predisposed to preneoplastic pathology. Our depletion of CD25+ cells matched data of mice undergoing neonatal thymectomy that were found to subsequently develop prostatitis. 64 Likewise, cytokine expression was increased in prostate and bowel tissue after CD25 cell depletion ( Fig. 4 a ), and conversely decreased after TREG cell supplementation ( Fig. 4 a , Table II ). It is important to note that the anti-CD25 treatment approach 29 may also deplete other nonregulatory cell CD25+ populations, such as activated effector T cells, 65 that may also contribute to experimental outcome; although, large numbers of activated cells bearing CD25 are unlikely in young mice lacking tumors and without targeted infections. Rapid repopulation of CD25+ cells after depletion has been previously described. 65 In addition, CD4+CD25-TREG cells are previously shown by our lab 38 and others 31 to downregulate inflammation in mice. These data do not invalidate a key role for CD25-TREG cells in prevention of cancer. Indeed, cotransfer of CD4+CD45RBloCD25+ cells together with CD4+CD45RBhiCD25?cells 38 was previously shown to provide the most robust enhancement of longevity and protection from cancer. The pivotal relationship between TREG cells and IL-6 was previously highlighted in wound repair after epithelial injury in the bowel of mice. 62 It was postulated in that model that antiinflammatory efficiency of TREG cells dictates outcome of wound healing. The normal aging process contributes to increased susceptibility to IL-6-mediated disruptions in TREG efficacy manifesting as delayed wound healing and dysregulated wound repair. 62 This progression of IL-6-mediated events was found to be most evident in male animals. 62 It is interesting that aged male Apc Min/+ mice supplemented with CD4+CD25+ cells in our study exhibited not only decreased levels of TNF-? and IL-6 but also reduction in cancer cachexia, along with improved longevity and fecundity, when compared to age-matched untreated Apc Min/+ mice (data not shown). The Apc Min/+ mouse has been proposed elsewhere 66 as a model for IL-6-associated wasting disease for cancer and aging in men, highlighting broader relevancy for our findings. Another noteworthy observation is the absence of overt inflammatory disease associated with prostate carcinoma development in this model. In humans, there is controversy over a role for inflammation in prostate cancer, although molecular pathogenesis of prostate cancer is characterized by somatic alterations of genes involved in inflammatory defenses and tissue recovery. 3 Interestingly, lymphocytes and macrophages were infrequent within prostate tissue in this model. Only mast cells were clearly linked with neoplastic lesions and invasive features (see Figs. 1 and 6 ). The absence of inflammatory cell infiltrate in Apc Min/+ mice matches prior data of TNF-?-dependent bowel neoplasia in mice lacking overt IBD. 27 , 46 These findings raise the possibility that the interplay between TNF-?, IL-6, IL-17 and TREG cells may have broader relevancy beyond cancers that are clearly linked with overt inflammatory disease. Inflammatory cytokine IL-9 was significantly elevated in mouse sera ( Table II ) and correlated with the development of prostatic neoplasia in our study. IL-9 is a growth factor linked with recruitment and activation of mast cells. 67 , 68 It is possible that IL-9 promoted prostate carcinogenesis in Apc Min/+ mice through activation of mast cells; indeed, mast cells may be important for creating a prostatic environment conducive to cancer development. 12 , 69 Mast cells and IL-9 are previously linked with activated TREG cells in maintenance of immune tolerance 68 ; thus, it is interesting that supplementation with exogenous TREG cells serves to lower levels of IL-9 (see Table II ) and also effectively suppresses carcinogenesis in Apc Min/+ mice. TNF-?-dependent mast cell accumulations were previously shown to be an essential feature of intestinal polyposis in mice, 47 and mast cells were a frequent feature in invasive intestinal lesions in our study (see Figs. 6 c and 6 d ). Alternatively, carcinoma may be due to a direct carcinogenic effect of IL-9 in prostate epithelia, although thus far IL-9 has proven oncogenic activities only in lymphoid cell malignancies of mice and humans. 70 Although similar prostate pathology was reported in male mice with inducible inactivation of the Apc gene, 25 it was unclear from the present studies whether intestinal polyposis contributed in any way to prostate cancer growth. In many murine models, bowel pathology depends on pathogenic bacterial infections that trigger a local and systemic proinflammatory carcinogenic host response. We have previously shown that infections with pathogenic intestinal bacteria may upregulate proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-? 34 , 37 and IL-6, 62 that subsequently contribute to carcinoma development and malignancy in distant sites. Infections with pathogenic bacteria have previously been linked with prostatitis in humans 71 and in rats. 12 Interestingly, in an immune-competent host, pathogenic bacteria or their toxins may also induce potent IL-10-dependent CD4+ TREG cells that are highly protective against inflammation-associated cancer. 27 , 46 , 72 Preliminary data using experimental bacterial challenges reveal similar dual harmful and beneficial roles for microbiota in prostate cancer in male Apc Min/+ mice (data not shown). The appearance of ampullary carcinomas in the duodenal papilla of Vater after depletion of CD25+ cells in 25% (2/8) of young Apc Min/+ mice is noteworthy. No such carcinomas were found after extensive examination of bowel tissues from age-matched or older Apc Min/+ mice. In humans with FAP, ampullary tumors are a serious cause of comorbidity. 73 Duodenal tumors in FAP patients are often clustered in the ampullary region and frequently become malignant. Compound mutant mice with disruption of Apc and SMAD4 suffer from a similar tumor phenotype. This invasive phenotype mirrors mice lacking Tgf-?1 and SMAD3, 74 – 76 as well as murine recipients of dysfunctional TREG cell, 62 suggesting that dysregulation of Tgf-? signaling may be a shared feature in all of these pathological syndromes. In conclusion, spontaneous prostate cancer arose in untreated male Apc Min/+ mice with a high frequency of HGPIN and microadenocarcinoma resembling age-associated prostate cancer in humans. Factors previously found with human prostate cancer, i.e ., IL-6, were significantly associated with development of carcinoma in this model. Although accumulated epidemiological and medical data support a link between chronic inflammation and prostate cancer, this is the first report providing evidence that TREG cells reduce development of preneoplastic and neoplastic findings in the prostate. Inflammatory cytokines were significantly elevated and linked with prostate cancer development, but without the presence of overt inflammatory disease in the prostate. In particular, serum IL-6 levels were correlated with cancer in these mice and may serve as a useful biomarker in humans. Future prophylactic and therapeutic strategies may focus upon reinforcing relevant immune fortification for protection against cancer development.
