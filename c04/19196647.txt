Mutations in Phosphoinositide Metabolizing Enzymes and Human Disease Phosphoinositides are implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular functions. Their importance in cellular and organismal physiology is underscored by the growing number of human diseases linked to perturbation of kinases and phosphatases that catalyze interconversion from one phosphoinositide to another. Many such enzymes are attractive targets for therapeutic interventions. Here, we review diseases linked to inheritable or somatic mutations of these enzymes.  Conclusion The wide array of diseases known to be caused by perturbation of genes encoding phosphoinositide metabolizing enzymes emphasizes the importance of inositol phospholipid regulation in cell and organismal physiology. It can be predicted that the number of such conditions will greatly increase as the identification of disease genes expands. In many cases, the mechanistic link between the metabolic defect due to the mutation and the phenotypic manifestations of the disease remains poorly understood. Each enzyme not only catalyzes a specific reaction, but also acts on specific phosphoinositide pools. Thus, to fully understand the link between metabolic defects and disease, it will be important to elucidate the precise intracellular site of action of each phosphoinositide metabolizing enzyme. These studies will both advance fundamental aspects of cell physiology and help identify new potential therapeutic targets. Given the broad importance of phosphoinositide metabolism in cell function, it can be anticipated that drugs resulting from these studies will have applications much beyond the therapy of genetic conditions due to mutations in phosphoinositide metabolizing enzymes.
