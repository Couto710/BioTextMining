Who Benefits from Granulomas, Mycobacteria or Host? By investigating host-pathogen interactions in zebrafish using intravital imaging, Davis and Ramakrishnan (2009) provide evidence that aggregates of immune cells known as granulomas, long thought to constrain mycobacterial infection, may instead facilitate its spread.
