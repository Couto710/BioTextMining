A Common Cortactin Gene Variation Confers Differential Susceptibility to Severe Asthma Genomic regions with replicated linkage to asthma-related phenotypes likely harbor multiple susceptibility loci with relatively minor effects on disease susceptibility. The 11q13 chromosomal region has repeatedly been linked to asthma with five genes residing in this region with reported replicated associations. Cortactin, an actin-binding protein encoded by the CTTN gene in 11q13, constitutes a key regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics and contractile cell machinery, events facilitated by interaction with myosin light chain kinase; encoded by MYLK , a gene we recently reported as associated with severe asthma in African Americans. To evaluate potential association of CTTN gene variation with asthma susceptibility, CTTN exons and flanking regions were re-sequenced in 48 non-asthmatic multiethnic samples, leading to selection of nine tagging polymorphisms for case-control association studies in individuals of European and African descent. After ancestry adjustments, an intronic variant (rs3802780) was significantly associated with severe asthma (odds ratio [OR]: 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-2.43; p = 0.003) in a joint analysis. Further analyses evidenced independent and additive effects of CTTN and MYLK risk variants for severe asthma susceptibility in African Americans (accumulated OR: 2.93, 95% CI: 1.40-6.13, p = 0.004). These data suggest that CTTN gene variation may contribute to severe asthma and that the combined effects of CTTN and MYLK risk polymorphisms may further increase susceptibility to severe asthma in African Americans harboring both genetic variants.  Methods Study populations and clinical evaluation Unrelated asthma cases (110 European Americans and 192 African Americans) were recruited in the Chicago area as part of the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Asthma protocol [ CSGA, 1997 ]. A brief clinical description of these samples has been reported [ Ober et al., 2000 ; Lester et al., 2001 ]. Controls (209 European-Americans and 193 African Americans) consisted of adult individuals with negative personal and first-degree relative family history for asthma. Cases and controls reported at least three grandparents who were either of European or African American ancestry. No medical history was taken, and no medical testing was performed on control individuals. Twenty seven European Americans and 103 African Americans asthmatics were diagnosed with severe asthma on the basis of nocturnal symptoms, prescribed use of either inhaled or oral steroids, a forced expiratory volume measurements (FEV1) < 60% predicted value at any time and time related reversibility (? 15% increase in baseline FEV1 after treatment). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Five samples (three European American controls and two African American cases, one of them with severe asthma) were excluded from subsequent analysis [ Flores et al., 2007 ] since their self-reported ancestry did not match molecular ancestry determined by the genotypes of 30 microsatellite markers selected to be informative on individual European, Asian and African ancestries [ Amundadottir et al., 2006 ]. <italic>CTTN</italic> Polymorphism Discovery DNA samples from 48 unrelated non-asthmatic individuals (19 African and 29 European Americans) were used to search for common variations in the CTTN gene. DNA sequencing protocols and polymorphism identification were performed as previously described [ Gao et al., 2006 ]. Primer pairs used are described in Table AI (Appendix A). The genomic sequence NM_005231 corresponding to CTTN isoform a, the longest transcript of the gene, was used as the reference sequence. Sequence variation is reported following established guidelines [ Antonarakis, 1998 ]. Genotyping Genotyping was conducted by means of TaqMan™ allelic discrimination assays on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) except for SNPs rs7131282 and rs34959377, that were genotyped using the SNaPshot® multiplex kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Briefly, amplification of SNP-containing fragments were performed in two separate PCR reactions (AmpliTaq Gold™ DNA Polymerase with 2.5 mM Mg2+, 10% DMSO and 0.1 ?M of primers 5?-TGGAGTTATGTGGTGGAAAC-3? and 5?-GGGAAGAGAACACAGAGAAA-3? for rs7131282, and 5?-GTATTCTCTGAACCCTTGGA-3? and 5?-CTGAGGCTGCTCTTAAACTG-3? for rs34959377 respectively). The SNaPshot® single base extension reaction was carried out simultaneously for both SNPs using 1 ?M of primers 5?-CCCTGCAGAGATGCGG-3? for rs7131282 and 5?-CCCCCCGGGAACTCAGGGGAACG-3? for rs34959377 based on manufacturer's recommendations. All genotype calls, excepting for rs7131282 and rs34959377 (genotyped by SNaPshot® reactions), were performed automatically by the SDS software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) based on discriminating plots (95% confidence) from the ratio between the allele probe fluorescent intensities after normalization. Genotyping was blind to the ethnic background of the sample or case and control status. Approximately 10% of the samples were genotyped in duplicate to monitor genotyping quality. Statistical Analysis Departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were tested by means of an exact test. The multiple-marker selection algorithm, haplotype r 2, included in TagIT 3.03 software [ Weale et al., 2003 ] was used to select a set of tagging SNPs (tSNPs) satisfying a minimum performance of r 2 > 0.90. This algorithm is known to maintain the tSNPs prediction accuracy while tending to increase tagging efficiency by selecting fewer tSNPs than other existing methods [ Ding and Kullo, 2007 ]. A SNP-dropping-with-re-sampling method [ Ahmadi et al., 2005 ] was used to verify that the expected properties of the tSNP set ensured a minimum performance of r 2 > 0.85 in both populations. SNP associations were tested by means of an additive model using the Armitage trend test. SPSS 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for multiple logistic regression analysis, including use of individual ancestries based on 30 microsatellites as covariates [ Flores et al., 2007 ] when appropriate, to estimate the odds ratios (OR) with their respective 95% confidence interval (CI). EPIDAT 3.0 was used for the Mantel-Haenszel stratified analysis and to estimate the effects of the two risk variants in CTTN and MYLK genes, the latter using dominant models for both SNPs due to the small sample sizes. A non-additive effect for gene-gene interaction was tested by means of SNPstats [ Sole et al., 2006 ]. Individual SNP associations were adjusted for multiple testing as implemented in the Simple Interactive Statistical Analysis web site [ Sankoh et al., 1997 ], using the Šidák procedure taking into account the composite linkage disequilibrium (LD), which works well in capturing the LD correlation among SNPs [ Zaykin et al., 2006 ], as a correlation estimator. In addition, we used two replication samples to reduce the likelihood of type I error. P -values were not corrected for the two conditions tested due to the non-independent nature of both phenotypes. The patterns of LD were explored using Haploview 3.32 [ Barrett et al., 2005 ].

The patterns of LD were explored using Haploview 3.32 [ Barrett et al., 2005 ].  Results SNP discovery and tagging SNP (tSNP) selection A total of 27 CTTN variants, all in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, were identified by re-sequencing 9,746 base pairs in each sample with each variant consisting of a single base change (SNP), with the exception of variation number 27 (ss76859860) which demonstrated a single base insertion ( Table I ). These SNPs generate an overall occurrence of one SNP every ?375 bp, similar to the average rate (one per 348 bp) reported in a re-sequencing survey of 106 genes [ Cargill et al., 1999 ]. Ten SNPs were entirely novel, two SNPs predicted an amino acid change, and 4 SNPs were not previously validated by frequency. CTTN SNPs 1, 2, 8, 13 and 27 showed a MAF < 5% in both populations whereas the previously described CTTN SNPs 1 (rs11825246) and 2 (rs11825335) demonstrated allelic frequencies of ?2-3% in Yoruba Nigerians (YRI) in the newly released HapMap [ The International HapMap Consortium, 2005 ]. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) plots suggested a broad heterogeneity of LD in the region with strong and moderate values clustering in the 3? end of the gene in both populations, also extending to the 5? end in European Americans ( Fig. 1 ). After excluding SNPs with MAF < 5%, a total of 6 and 7 SNPs were sufficient to provide an adequate coverage of CTTN gene variation in European and African Americans, respectively. Nine cosmopolitan tSNPs, providing adequate coverage in both populations, were selected for association studies. These tSNPs tagged common SNPs (MAF ? 5%) in YRI subjects and in samples from Utah residents with ancestry from northern and Western Europe (CEU) with slightly increased performances than those achieved in the re-sequenced samples. Additionally, a total of 4 and 7 tSNPs from HapMap provided adequate coverage of CTTN gene variation in CEU and YRI, respectively, congruent with our estimates for European- and African Americans. <italic>CTTN</italic> gene variants in disease susceptibility All SNPs displayed average automatic quality call values over 99% confidence. Among the successfully retyped samples, no discrepancies were found with the original genotypes for any of the SNPs, giving an estimated overall discordance rate of 0.0% (95% CI: 0.0-0.9%). Additionally, all CTTN tSNPs were in HWE in both panels (Table BI, Appendix B). The minor allele frequencies by population, SNP information, and p -values for association with asthma and severe asthma are shown in Table II . No SNP was associated with susceptibility to asthma in either European or African Americans, however, an intronic SNP (rs3802780) showed a significant uncorrected association with severe asthma in African Americans (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.08-2.42). When adjusted for multiple testing, this association trended towards significance ( p ? 0.08) and strikingly, this was the only SNP with a significant uncorrected association in European Americans (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.07-4.57), despite the small number of severe asthmatics in this panel. Nevertheless, an adjustment for multiple testing also drove this association towards borderline significance ( p ? 0.09). We noted that HWE p -value for this SNP was nearly significant in European American controls. However, quality measures for this SNP revealed satisfactory results since genotyping was simultaneous and blind to affectation status or ethnicity and non-significant HWE p -values were found for other sample groups, automatic quality call was 99.45%, completion rate was 97%, and no differences for the rate of completion proportions were found between controls and severe asthmatics ( p = 0.32). Thus, systematic errors in genotyping do not appear to account for these results. To rule out potentially spurious associations due to population stratification, proportions of ancestry estimated from 30 unlinked microsatellites available from these samples [ Amundadottir et al., 2006 ] were considered for adjustments. Estimated individual ancestries were not significantly different between African American controls and severe asthmatics [ Flores et al., 2007 ], and the results remained unchanged when included in a logistic regression model (OR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.07-2.42, p = 0.022). In European Americans, both European (0.98 ± 0.054 in controls vs. 0.99 ± 0.021 in severe asthmatics, t-test p = 0.015) and Asian (0.014 ± 0.049 in controls vs. 0.00 ± 0.006 in severe asthmatics, t-test p = 0.001) ancestries differed slightly but significantly between controls and severe asthmatics. However, the observed SNP association in European Americans remained unchanged in a logistic regression model (OR: 2.62, 95% CI: 1.22-5.63, p = 0.014). A stratified Mantel-Haenszel test ( p = 0.0022) or a joint logistic regression model for the two populations taking into account the estimated ancestries ( p = 0.003) further showed a strong association of this SNP with severe asthma. The rs3802780 A allele was associated with risk in both populations (joint OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.20-2.43) ( Table III ). A sliding window haplotype analysis performed as we previously described [ Flores et al., 2007 ] failed to reveal significant results for any sample comparison (not shown). Combined effects of <italic>CTTN</italic> and <italic>MYLK</italic> risk variants in severe asthma The CTTN SNP rs3802780 was found to be significantly associated with severe asthma in the same African American case-control samples in which we previously reported the association ( p = 0.005) of a non-synonymous MYLK coding SNP (rs9840993) with severe asthma [ Flores et al., 2007 ]. As we have previously described strong biological interaction between these gene products [ Dudek et al., 2002 ; Dudek et al., 2004 ], we explored the combined effects of both genes on severe asthma in African Americans. Other than an additive accumulation of risk from the alleles at both genes ( Figure 2 ), interaction effects were not detected under any model tested ( p -value > 0.10). However, African Americans carriers of at least one risk allele at both genes had almost a three-fold increase risk for severe asthma (OR: 2.93, 95% CI: 1.40-6.13, p = 0.004) compared to non-risk allele carriers at both genes.

However, the observed SNP association in European Americans remained unchanged in a logistic regression model (OR: 2.62, 95% CI: 1.22-5.63, p = 0.014). A stratified Mantel-Haenszel test ( p = 0.0022) or a joint logistic regression model for the two populations taking into account the estimated ancestries ( p = 0.003) further showed a strong association of this SNP with severe asthma. The rs3802780 A allele was associated with risk in both populations (joint OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.20-2.43) ( Table III ). A sliding window haplotype analysis performed as we previously described [ Flores et al., 2007 ] failed to reveal significant results for any sample comparison (not shown).

As we have previously described strong biological interaction between these gene products [ Dudek et al., 2002 ; Dudek et al., 2004 ], we explored the combined effects of both genes on severe asthma in African Americans. Other than an additive accumulation of risk from the alleles at both genes ( Figure 2 ), interaction effects were not detected under any model tested ( p -value > 0.10). However, African Americans carriers of at least one risk allele at both genes had almost a three-fold increase risk for severe asthma (OR: 2.93, 95% CI: 1.40-6.13, p = 0.004) compared to non-risk allele carriers at both genes.

However, the observed SNP association in European Americans remained unchanged in a logistic regression model (OR: 2.62, 95% CI: 1.22-5.63, p = 0.014). A stratified Mantel-Haenszel test ( p = 0.0022) or a joint logistic regression model for the two populations taking into account the estimated ancestries ( p = 0.003) further showed a strong association of this SNP with severe asthma. The rs3802780 A allele was associated with risk in both populations (joint OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.20-2.43) ( Table III ). A sliding window haplotype analysis performed as we previously described [ Flores et al., 2007 ] failed to reveal significant results for any sample comparison (not shown).  <italic>CTTN</italic> gene variants in disease susceptibility All SNPs displayed average automatic quality call values over 99% confidence. Among the successfully retyped samples, no discrepancies were found with the original genotypes for any of the SNPs, giving an estimated overall discordance rate of 0.0% (95% CI: 0.0-0.9%). Additionally, all CTTN tSNPs were in HWE in both panels (Table BI, Appendix B). The minor allele frequencies by population, SNP information, and p -values for association with asthma and severe asthma are shown in Table II . No SNP was associated with susceptibility to asthma in either European or African Americans, however, an intronic SNP (rs3802780) showed a significant uncorrected association with severe asthma in African Americans (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.08-2.42). When adjusted for multiple testing, this association trended towards significance ( p ? 0.08) and strikingly, this was the only SNP with a significant uncorrected association in European Americans (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.07-4.57), despite the small number of severe asthmatics in this panel. Nevertheless, an adjustment for multiple testing also drove this association towards borderline significance ( p ? 0.09). We noted that HWE p -value for this SNP was nearly significant in European American controls. However, quality measures for this SNP revealed satisfactory results since genotyping was simultaneous and blind to affectation status or ethnicity and non-significant HWE p -values were found for other sample groups, automatic quality call was 99.45%, completion rate was 97%, and no differences for the rate of completion proportions were found between controls and severe asthmatics ( p = 0.32). Thus, systematic errors in genotyping do not appear to account for these results. To rule out potentially spurious associations due to population stratification, proportions of ancestry estimated from 30 unlinked microsatellites available from these samples [ Amundadottir et al., 2006 ] were considered for adjustments. Estimated individual ancestries were not significantly different between African American controls and severe asthmatics [ Flores et al., 2007 ], and the results remained unchanged when included in a logistic regression model (OR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.07-2.42, p = 0.022). In European Americans, both European (0.98 ± 0.054 in controls vs. 0.99 ± 0.021 in severe asthmatics, t-test p = 0.015) and Asian (0.014 ± 0.049 in controls vs. 0.00 ± 0.006 in severe asthmatics, t-test p = 0.001) ancestries differed slightly but significantly between controls and severe asthmatics.

The rs3802780 A allele was associated with risk in both populations (joint OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.20-2.43) ( Table III ). A sliding window haplotype analysis performed as we previously described [ Flores et al., 2007 ] failed to reveal significant results for any sample comparison (not shown).  Combined effects of <italic>CTTN</italic> and <italic>MYLK</italic> risk variants in severe asthma The CTTN SNP rs3802780 was found to be significantly associated with severe asthma in the same African American case-control samples in which we previously reported the association ( p = 0.005) of a non-synonymous MYLK coding SNP (rs9840993) with severe asthma [ Flores et al., 2007 ]. As we have previously described strong biological interaction between these gene products [ Dudek et al., 2002 ; Dudek et al., 2004 ], we explored the combined effects of both genes on severe asthma in African Americans. Other than an additive accumulation of risk from the alleles at both genes ( Figure 2 ), interaction effects were not detected under any model tested ( p -value > 0.10). However, African Americans carriers of at least one risk allele at both genes had almost a three-fold increase risk for severe asthma (OR: 2.93, 95% CI: 1.40-6.13, p = 0.004) compared to non-risk allele carriers at both genes.  Combined effects of <italic>CTTN</italic> and <italic>MYLK</italic> risk variants in severe asthma The CTTN SNP rs3802780 was found to be significantly associated with severe asthma in the same African American case-control samples in which we previously reported the association ( p = 0.005) of a non-synonymous MYLK coding SNP (rs9840993) with severe asthma [ Flores et al., 2007 ]. As we have previously described strong biological interaction between these gene products [ Dudek et al., 2002 ; Dudek et al., 2004 ], we explored the combined effects of both genes on severe asthma in African Americans.

Discussion Although the TENOR [ Dolan et al., 2004 ] and the ENFUMOSA [2003] multi-centric studies have provided new epidemiological information regarding severe or difficult-to-treat asthma, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to this condition remain unclear. The structural changes in the airways accompanying asthma, a consequence of an airway injury/repair driven by chronic inflammation [ Orsida et al., 1999 ; McDonald, 2001 ; Black and Johnson, 2002 ], are collectively termed airway remodeling with epithelial changes, mucus gland and goblet cell hyperplasia, subepithelial fibrosis, airway smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and vascular remodeling. Remodeling is most prominent in severe asthma and contributes to the development of persistent bronchial hyperresponsiveness, chronic airflow obstruction and lack of responsiveness to corticosteroid treatment [ Holgate and Polosa, 2006 ]. Twin studies have suggested that asthma severity exhibits a hereditary component [ Sarafino and Goldfedder, 1995 ] and, congruently, several genes have been associated with disease severity [ Ober and Hoffjan, 2006 ]. Firmly replicated susceptibility genes, such as ADAM33 and TGFB1 , encode molecules which participate in the remodeling processes (rather than in immunological aspects), are highly expressed in airway tissues/cells of severe asthmatics [ Minshall et al., 1997 ; Balzar et al., 2005 ; Lee et al., 2006b ; Foley et al., 2007 ], and demonstrate significant association with severe asthma exacerbations [ Pulleyn et al., 2001 ; Jongepier et al., 2004 ; Kedda et al., 2006 ; Mak et al., 2006 ]. Despite the evidence provided by biochemical studies, the exact role of cortactin in asthma remains ill-defined but likely involve participation in processes such as cell migration, angiogenesis and immunoregulation thereby contributing to the complex cellular and molecular events involved in remodeling [ Jeffery, 2001 ]. Consistent with this concept, re-sequencing CTTN gene and genotyping 9 tSNPs in case-control samples of diverse ancestry revealed a SNP (rs3802780) significantly associated with severe asthma, where remodeling is suggested to be the major determinant for the persistent and uncontrolled phenotypic characteristic [ Holgate and Polosa, 2006 ]. Despite this persuasive pathobiologic rationale, we fully recognize that individually, our results are only modestly significant for CTTN effects in asthma and did not survive strict correction for multiple testing (adjusted p -values ? 0.09). However, the consistent association of the identical SNP with the same phenotype in asthma in two independent case-control samples of African and European American descent provides strong evidence for a modest but potentially significant role of CTTN gene in severe asthma. We also recognize the limitations of our reduced sample size studied. As a result, our results must be interpreted with caution since statistical power was not adequate to detect associations of variants with weak-to-moderate effects in severe asthma, particularly in European Americans (power < 30%). Additional limitations of our study is the utilization of controls in which asthma was not clinically excluded thereby failing to allow for evaluation of potential confounding factors that may alternatively explain the association. Moreover, it can be argued that the inclusion of control samples not clinically characterized would tend to favor null hypothesis (no association between variants and phenotypes) due to the potential inclusion of subjects with undiagnosed asthma, reducing the power of the study even further (on average <4% as estimated by Kurz et al., [2006] ). It remains unlikely, however, that any of controls subjects had undiagnosed asthma (undiagnosed severe asthma is unquestionably highly unlikely), particularly given that no first degree relative had asthma in this over 18 years old cohort. We reduced the likelihood of false positives by adjusting for the proportions of ancestry estimated from 30 unlinked microsatellites that were selected for being informative for distinguishing between European, African and Asian ancestries [ Amundadottir et al., 2006 ]. Although not empirically evaluated for their individual assignment ability, similar numbers of less informative microsatellites have demonstrated an assignment accuracy of >99% among European and African Americans [ Yang et al., 2005 ]. However, since these markers were not selected for their ability to detect substructure within continental regions [ Price et al., 2008 ], another limitation of the study is that modest levels of population stratification cannot be discarded that may have biased the results. Although rs3802780 is intronic, the G allele is conserved across several (but not all) mammalian species (rhesus monkey, dog, armadillo and opossum) as assessed by the UCSC Genome Browser. In order to explore if other variant with apparent functional consequences in CTTN or in flanking genes may explain the association of this SNP with severe asthma, we examined the LD patterns of common (MAF ? 5%) variation in our re-sequenced samples and in the ?400 kb region around CTTN (including the two flanking genes, PPFIA1 and SHANK2 , the latter encoding a multidomain scaffolding protein which, similar to MLCK, binds directly to the SH3 domain of cortactin [ Redecker et al., 2001 ; McWilliams et al., 2004 ]) in CEU and YRI HapMap samples. Since rs3802780 did not exhibit moderate-to-strong LD levels to SNPs outside of CTTN gene, this suggested that the association with severe asthma was most likely to be directly due to the CTTN gene (Figure C1, Appendix C). Maximum r 2 values with flanking regions were 0.26 with rs3781649 in YRI and 0.68 with rs3781646 in CEU, both SNPs located in PPFIA1 gene. Seven additional CTTN SNPs in high LD with rs3802780 ( r 2 ? 0.85) and common to both populations were: rs643301, rs482438, rs1198236, rs548687, rs611216, rs592501, and rs1198234. Of these, only rs643301 was a coding SNP but only predicted a synonymous change (Tyr486Tyr). The other three coding SNPs in CTTN showed weak levels of LD with the associated SNP in both HapMap samples (rs2298397 was the only other coding SNP available and showed MAF ? 5% in CEU; r 2 = 0.07) and the re-sequencing samples (maximum r 2 values were 0.26 with the novel SNP ss76859857 in African Americans, 0.18 with the novel SNP ss76859859 in European Americans). Thus, non-synonymous CTTN SNPs were weakly correlated with rs3802780, and functional consequences of the SNPs in strong LD with it in either the CTTN gene itself or in flanking genes were not apparent. Finally, we also demonstrated that severe asthma risk for African Americans increases by three-fold in carriers of at least one risk allele at both rs3802780 and rs9840993, a previously described severe asthma susceptibility polymorphism in MYLK gene [ Flores et al., 2007 ]. Although these two proteins physically interact in cellular environments [ Dudek et al., 2002 ], an effect due to gene-gene interaction was not detected. Rather, our results suggest that variation in multiple genes in this pathway have an additive effect on risk for severe asthma. However, according to our own estimations following Gauderman [2002] , larger sample sizes would be required to derive a firm conclusion pertaining to the gene-gene interaction. In summary, motivated by published positional and biological evidence, we studied the association of 9 carefully selected tSNPs of CTTN gene with susceptibility to asthma in multi-ethnic case-control samples and identified a promising association with the intronic SNP rs3802780 in severe asthma. Differences for the expression level of this gene have been reported between HapMap YRI and CEU cell lines [ Storey et al., 2007 ; Zhang et al., 2008 ]. However, our data indicates that this SNP per se is not contributing to disparities in asthma severity between ethnic groups [ El-Ekiaby et al., 2006 ]. Additionally, the combined effect of both rs3802780 and rs9840993, a previously described susceptibility SNP in the MYLK gene in African Americans, was much greater than the effects of either individual SNP. These observations, combined with reduced LD in other variants in nearby regions in reference samples [ The International HapMap Consortium, 2005 ], support our hypothesis that the CTTN gene contains severe asthma susceptibility polymorphisms. We can not yet conclude whether this association is truly positive and if it is directly determined by rs3802780 or by other gene variant(s), the focus of additional future studies to confirm this association.
