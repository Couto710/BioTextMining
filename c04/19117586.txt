Effect of Mucosal Fluid from Women with Bacterial Vaginosis on HIV Trans-infection Mediated by Dendritic Cells Women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) have a higher risk of HIV transmission but the cause of risk is unknown. Dendritic cells (DC) are implicated in transmission of HIV and we previously observed that DC mature when exposed to mucosal fluid from women with BV. We hypothesized that maturation of DC by BV mucosal fluid would enhance DC-mediated trans -infection of HIV. Monocyte-derived DC (MDDC) were treated with mucosal fluid, incubated with HIVBal, and HIV trans- infection was evaluated. While LPS-treated MDDC increased HIVBal trans -infection, BV fluid reduced trans -infection. HIVBal DNA levels in MDDC were not affected by BV fluid or LPS but productive infection of MDDC was decreased by LPS and BV fluid. Mucosal fluid from women with BV does not increase MDDC-mediated trans -infection suggesting that BV does not increase HIV susceptibility by increasing DC-mediated trans- infection. However, indirect effects of DC maturation on HIV transmission cannot be ruled out.  INTRODUCTION Dendritic cells are believed to be an important target for HIV during sexual transmission due to their presence at mucosal surfaces, their function as antigen capturing cells and their role in initiating adaptive immune responses by interacting with T cells ( Piguet and Steinman, 2007 ). Experimental models of HIV sexual transmission show that DC are one of the first cells infected. Thus, 18 hours after intravaginal inoculation of macaques with SIV, SIV RNA can be detected in DC isolated from the vaginal epithelium ( Hu, Gardner, and Miller, 2000 ). In an ex-vivo human vaginal tissue culture system, HIV rapidly enters Langerhans cells ( Hladik et al., 2007 ) and DC in ex vivo cervical explants take up HIV ( Hu et al., 2004 ). DC can be directly infected by HIV but also pass HIV to T cells (trans-infection) and maturation of DC induces an increase in trans-infection ( Granelli-Piperno et al., 1998 ; Izquierdo-Useros et al., 2007 ; McDonald et al., 2003 ; Sanders et al., 2002 ). Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is highly prevalent worldwide and is associated with an increased risk for HIV acquisition ( Cohen et al., 1995 ; Martin et al., 1999 ; Myer et al., 2005 ; Sewankambo et al., 1997 ; Taha et al., 1998 ). BV consists of a shift in vaginal microbiota from predominantly lactobacilli in healthy women to other bacteria that include both gram-positive and gram negative bacteria ( Eschenbach et al., 1989 ; Fredricks, Fiedler, and Marrazzo, 2005 ). The frequency of BV in women of child bearing age in North American populations is between 5–30% and can be much higher in groups from some African nations ( Greenblatt et al., 1999 ; Schwebke, 2003 ; Sewankambo et al., 1997 ). We previously observed that monocyte-derived DC (MDDC) are activated and matured when exposed to the mucosal fluid from women with BV ( St John et al., 2007 ) and there have been several studies that show that MDDC exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes them to mature and concomitantly increase their ability to mediate HIV trans -infection ( Granelli-Piperno et al., 1998 ; McDonald et al., 2003 ). We therefore hypothesized that the association between BV and increased sexual transmission of HIV could be due to increased trans-infection of HIV to T cells caused by the activating/maturing effect that BV has on DC. This study determined whether mucosal fluid from women with BV increased in vitro HIV trans-infection of T cells mediated by MDDC.  MATERIAL AND METHODS Patient Samples Cervical vaginal lavage (CVL) samples were obtained with informed consent from a cohort of women attending a fertility clinic (UNICAMP, Sao Paulo, Brazil). CVL were collected by irrigation of the cervix with 10 ml of nonbacteriostatic sterile saline followed by aspiration from the posterior fornix. CVL were centrifuged at 800 × g for 20 min to remove cell debris and stored at ?80°C. Gram stains of vaginal swabs were evaluated using the Nugent criteria ( Nugent, Krohn, and Hillier, 1991 ). Studies were performed only on samples with Nugent scores of 8–10 (positive for BV) or scores of 0–3 (negative for BV, normal flora). CVL were from women negative for yeast, Chlamydia, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and cervical dysplasia ( St John et al., 2007 ). The BV CVL used in this study was a pool of equal volumes of CVL collected from 23 women positive for BV while the Normal CVL was pooled from 17 women negative for BV. DC generation and stimulation Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from the blood of healthy donors by centrifugation on Lymphocyte Separation Medium (BioWhittaker, Walkerville, MD). The blood donors provided informed consent and the study was approved by the Rush institutional review board. Monocytes were isolated with CD14+ microbeads and the autoMACS cell separation system (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) yielding greater than 95% purity as determined by flow cytometry. Isolated monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), 2mM L-Glutamine (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), 1000 U/ml GM-CSF (Leukine, Berlex, Richmond CA) and 2900 U/ml IL-4 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 2×106 cells/ml for 6 days at 37°C in 5% CO2 ( McDonald et al., 2003 ; Sallusto et al., 1995 ; Sallusto and Lanzavecchia, 1994 ; Thurner et al., 1999 ). Cytokines were replenished on days 2 and 4. On day 6 the MDDCs were harvested and cultured for a further 48 hrs (1×106 MDDC in 1 ml total volume) with either medium alone, 1?g/ml E. coli Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis MO) or CVL samples at 10% of total culture volume ( St John et al., 2007 ). Virus HIVBal obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH) was produced in PHA-stimulated PBMCs using standard methods ( ACTG, 2004 ). In brief, PBMC were isolated from human blood and stimulated at 2×106 cells/ml with 4 ?g/ml PHA with 20 U/ml IL-2 for 2 days. Virus was added to stimulated PBMCs and supernatants of this culture were harvested at days 5–11. The p24 and TCID50 of these cultures was then assessed by p24 ELISA (HIV-1 p24 Antigen Capture Assay Kit, SAIC-Frederick Inc., Frederick, MD). Exposure of MDDC to HIV MDDC stimulated for 48hr with LPS, CVL or medium were harvested, washed and incubated at 37°C with HIV-1Bal at 500 TCID50 for 2hrs. MDDC were then washed twice with PBS and a third time with medium and cultured at 105 cells/0.2ml/well in 96 well plates. Supernatants from each well were harvested on days 5 and 7 and tested for p24 levels (HIV-1 p24 Antigen Capture Assay Kit, SAIC-Frederick Inc., Frederick, MD). MDDC Transfer of HIV<sub>Bal</sub> to T-cells Transfer of HIV from MDDC to T cells was performed similar to previous studies ( Geijtenbeek et al., 2000 ; Pope et al., 1994 ). In brief, while MDDC were being incubated with stimuli, PBMC from a healthy donor were isolated and stimulated for 48 hrs with 4 ?g/ml PHA and 20 Units/ml IL-2. PHA-stimulated PBMC and virus-exposed MDDC were added to triplicate wells at a ratio of 1:3 (33,000 MDDC: 100,000 PBMC). Some of the culture wells were incubated with 2 ?M AZT for 1.5 hrs before mixing DC and PBMC and the level of AZT was maintained throughout the experiment. Supernatants were harvested on days 5 and 7 for p24 ELISA. Quantitative Real-Time PCR for Measurements of HIV-1 DNA Following the 48hr incubation with stimuli, 6×105 MDDC were washed and incubated at 37°C with HIV-1Bal at TCID50 2500 in tubes in 200 ?l culture medium. The tubes were shaken for the first 2 hrs of incubation followed by a further 24 hrs of culture. After infection, MDDC were washed 3X with cold PBS and DNA isolated from cells (DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). HIV DNA was quantified by Real-Time PCR of the isolated DNA tissues using SYBR Green PCR core Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR System. The amplification reaction was carried out in triplicate by using 1X SYBR Green, 2.5mM MgCl2, 0.25mM dNTPs, 0.04?M primers, 0.01 Units of UNG and 0.02 Units of Taq Polymerase in 50?l of total volume. The following primers were used as per Chun et al. ( Chun et al., 2003 ): 5?-GGTCTCTCTGGTTAGACCAGAT-3? (5?primer) and 5?CTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTG-3? (3? primer). DNA levels were normalized using primers for human GAPDH. Flow Cytometric Analysis of MDDC After culture of MDDC with stimuli for 48hr, cell surface expression of CD40, CD83, CD86, CD14, PDL-1, CCR5, CD54, CD209, and CCR7 were evaluated by flow cytometry. The MDDC were identified as CD14?, CD1a+ and HLA-DR+ ( Relloso et al., 2002 ; Romani et al., 1996 ; Sallusto and Lanzavecchia, 1994 ). Cell surface markers were evaluated using APC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to CD40, CD83, CD86, CD14 (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA) PDL-1 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), PerCP-conjugated mAb to HLA-DR (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA), PE-conjugated mAbs to CCR5, CD54, CD209, CCR7 (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) and FITC-conjugated mAb to CD1a (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA). All gates were set based on staining of isotype controls for each fluorochrome. Statistical Analysis The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test, Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance, and the Friedman test were used to determine statistically significant differences between groups. The analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 4 software (San Diego, CA).

MDDCs were incubated for 48hr with either medium, LPS or CVL from women with BV or normal flora. MDDC were harvested and assessed by flow cytometry for expression (Mean Fluorescence Intensity) of HLA-DR and CD83. Isotype control is shown in the Medium panel. One representative experiment of eight independent experiments is shown using MDDC from eight different donors. Figure 2 Effect of mucosal fluids on MDDC mediated trans -infection. MDDCs were incubated with medium, LPS or CVL for 48 hr, washed and followed by 2hr exposure to HIV-1Bal. Unbound virus was removed by washing and PHA stimulated PBMCs were then added to MDDC in wells of a 96 well plate at a ratio of 1:3 (MDDC: PBMC). AZT was added to some wells containing medium-treated MDDC and PHA stimulated PBMC. Supernatants were removed after 5 days of culture and analyzed for p24 by ELISA. p values were determined by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks test. Each data point represents the average of triplicate wells from one independent experiment. Eight different MDDC donors were used. Figure 3 Effect of mucosal fluids on HIV-1Bal infection of MDDC. MDDC were incubated for 48hr with either medium, LPS, CVL from women with BV or CVL from women with normal flora. (A) Cells were washed and infected with HIV-1Bal for 2 hrs. AZT (2?M) was added to some of the cultures containing medium-treated cells and maintained throughout the duration of the experiment. Productive infection of MDDC measured by p24 production in culture supernatants 5 days after infection. (B) Infection of MDDC measured by HIV DNA formation in cells 24hr after infection with HIV-1Bal normalized to GAPDH Each point represents the average of triplicate wells from one independent experiment and the line indicates the median value of each group. Five different MDDC donors were used for these experiments. (A). p values were determined by the Friedman test (A) and Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (B). Figure 4 Effect of mucosal fluids on levels of MDDC cell-surface markers. MDDCs were incubated with medium, LPS or CVL for 48hr. MDDC were harvested and assessed by flow cytometry for expression (Mean Fluorescence Intensity) of CCR5 (PE), CD209 (PE), PDL-1 (APC) and CD54 (PE). Isotype controls for the two different fluorochromes are shown in panels CCR5 (PE), PDL-1 (APC). One representative experiment of three independent experiments is shown using MDDCs from three different donors.  RESULTS Mucosal fluid from women with BV activate MDDC To determine the effect of mucosal secretions on MDDC activation and maturation, MDDCs were cultured with stimuli for 48hr and expression of cell surface CD83 and HLA-DR was determined. Expression of CD83 and HLA-DR were significantly increased due to BV CVL when compared to medium (control) treated MDDC (p=0.0286 and p<0.001 respectively, Mann Whiney test of eight experiments) ( Fig. 1 .). LPS-treated MDDC also had increased levels of CD83 and HLA-DR compared to control, but these levels were not significantly different from BV CVL-treated MDDC. Normal CVL (CVL from women with normal flora – no BV) did not significantly increase CD83 or HLA-DR on MDDC compared to medium-treated MDDC. AnnexinV/PI staining of MDDC was also analyzed following treatments to determine if the MDDC were undergoing apoptosis or cell death. Medium-treated MDDC were 17.3 % positive for Annexin plus PI dual staining. LPS, BV CVL or normal CVL treatment did not significantly increase this level of staining (data not shown). Mucosal fluid from women with BV reduces MDDC-mediated HIV-1<sub>Bal</sub> <italic>trans-</italic>infection of PBMC Previous studies showed that LPS treatment of MDDCs increased HIV trans-infection ( Granelli-Piperno et al., 1998 ; McDonald et al., 2003 ; Sanders et al., 2002 ). Since LPS and BV CVL both induced activation and maturation of MDDC ( Fig. 1 .), we hypothesized that BV CVL would also increase trans -infection. To test this, MDDC from 8 different donors were treated with either Normal CVL or BV CVL were incubated with HIV for 2hrs and then cultured with PHA-stimulated PBMC for five days. Cultures with medium-treated MDDC had median p24 levels of 55,703 pg/ml whereas LPS-treated MDDC had significantly increased levels of p24 at 91,181pg/ml (p=0.0068) ( Fig. 2 .). Unexpectedly, p24 levels from cultures with BV CVL-treated MDDC were significantly lower than medium-treated MDDC (21,835 pg/ml, p=0.001). Cultures with Normal CVL-treated MDDC (44,344 pg/ml) had significantly lower p24 than LPS-treated MDDC (p=0.0068) but were not significantly different than medium-treated MDDC ( Fig. 2 .). AZT treatment of cultures reduced trans-infection to near background levels with median value of 80 pg/ml (p<0.0001). Experiments were also performed to determine if CVL samples had a direct effect on HIV infection of CD4 T cells. Positively selected CD4 T cells were incubated with CVL, infected with HIV and cultured. Neither BV-CVL or Normal-CVL had a significant effect on the amount of p24 measured in cultures after five day of culture (data not shown). To determine if higher amounts of HIVBal added to BV CVL-treated MDDC would lead to increased trans -infection, 2X or 4X more HIVBal than were used in the Figure 2 experiments were incubated with MDDC before addition to PBMC. However, increasing the viral inoculum added to BV CVL-treated MDDC did not increase trans -infection over 1X virus (data not shown). BV mucosal fluid decreased HIV infection of MDDC with HIV-1<sub>Bal</sub> To investigate why BV CVL decreased MDDC-mediated trans-infection while LPS increased trans-infection, the level of infection of MDDC was analyzed. Previous reports showed that LPS decreased MDDC infection ( Cavrois et al., 2006 ; Granelli-Piperno et al., 1998 ; McDyer et al., 1999 ). Both the level of productive infection and HIV DNA formation were measured in MDDC after exposure to CVL. Medium-treated MDDC from five different donors produced 2764 pg p24/ml (median) 5 days after infection ( Fig. 3a .). Exposure to either BV CVL or LPS decreased p24 production to 395 and 609 respectively (p<0.001 and p<0.01 Repeated Measures ANOVA). In contrast, p24 production from MDDC exposed to Normal CVL (2005 pg/ml) was not significantly different than medium control. MDDC cultured with AZT was significantly lower than all other treatments at 107 pg/ml (p<0.001). When HIV DNA formation in MDDC from the same five donors was measured, medium-treated MDDC yielded 675 HIV DNA copies/50 ng DNA (median), but in contrast to the results seen with p24 production, LPS and BV CVL did not significantly affect HIV DNA levels ( Fig. 3b .). There was, however, a significant difference between the level of medium treatment and AZT treatment of the MDDC (p<0.01). Effect of BV mucosal fluid on MDDC CCR5, DC-SIGN, PDL-1 and CD54 To further investigate the mechanism for the decreased trans-infection following treatment of MDDC with BV mucosal fluid, expression of CCR5, DC-SIGN, PDL-1 and CD54 were assessed. The level of CCR5 on MDDC was measured as this is a known co-receptor for HIV-1 R5 viruses such as HIV-Bal. However, CCR5 expression was not affected by any of the treatments. CD209 (DC-SIGN), a C-type lectin implicated in HIV trans-infection was decreased on both LPS-treated and BV CVL-treated MDDC when compared to medium-treated MDDC (MFI of 144 and 183 vs. 452 respectively) ( Fig. 4 .). PDL-1 is a costimulatory molecule present on DC that binds PD-1 on T-cells and has been shown to inhibit T-cell proliferation ( Keir, Francisco, and Sharpe, 2007 ). PDL-1 was elevated on LPS-treated MDDC when compared to medium-treated MDDC (MFI 524 vs. 153 respectively). PDL-1 on BV CVL-treated MDDC (MFI 370) was also elevated when compared to medium but was lower than LPS-treated MDDC ( Fig. 4 .). CD54 (ICAM-1) interacts with LFA-1 on T cells and has been implicated as an important surface molecule in HIV trans-infection ( Fortin et al., 1997 ; Sanders et al., 2002 ; Tardif and Tremblay, 2003 ). BV CVL-treated MDDC expressed lower CD54 when compared to LPS treatment of MDDC (MFI of 810 vs. 1560 respectively) ( Fig. 4 .).  RESULTS Mucosal fluid from women with BV activate MDDC To determine the effect of mucosal secretions on MDDC activation and maturation, MDDCs were cultured with stimuli for 48hr and expression of cell surface CD83 and HLA-DR was determined. Expression of CD83 and HLA-DR were significantly increased due to BV CVL when compared to medium (control) treated MDDC (p=0.0286 and p<0.001 respectively, Mann Whiney test of eight experiments) ( Fig. 1 .). LPS-treated MDDC also had increased levels of CD83 and HLA-DR compared to control, but these levels were not significantly different from BV CVL-treated MDDC. Normal CVL (CVL from women with normal flora – no BV) did not significantly increase CD83 or HLA-DR on MDDC compared to medium-treated MDDC. AnnexinV/PI staining of MDDC was also analyzed following treatments to determine if the MDDC were undergoing apoptosis or cell death. Medium-treated MDDC were 17.3 % positive for Annexin plus PI dual staining. LPS, BV CVL or normal CVL treatment did not significantly increase this level of staining (data not shown). Mucosal fluid from women with BV reduces MDDC-mediated HIV-1<sub>Bal</sub> <italic>trans-</italic>infection of PBMC Previous studies showed that LPS treatment of MDDCs increased HIV trans-infection ( Granelli-Piperno et al., 1998 ; McDonald et al., 2003 ; Sanders et al., 2002 ).

To test this, MDDC from 8 different donors were treated with either Normal CVL or BV CVL were incubated with HIV for 2hrs and then cultured with PHA-stimulated PBMC for five days. Cultures with medium-treated MDDC had median p24 levels of 55,703 pg/ml whereas LPS-treated MDDC had significantly increased levels of p24 at 91,181pg/ml (p=0.0068) ( Fig. 2 .). Unexpectedly, p24 levels from cultures with BV CVL-treated MDDC were significantly lower than medium-treated MDDC (21,835 pg/ml, p=0.001). Cultures with Normal CVL-treated MDDC (44,344 pg/ml) had significantly lower p24 than LPS-treated MDDC (p=0.0068) but were not significantly different than medium-treated MDDC ( Fig. 2 .). AZT treatment of cultures reduced trans-infection to near background levels with median value of 80 pg/ml (p<0.0001). Experiments were also performed to determine if CVL samples had a direct effect on HIV infection of CD4 T cells. Positively selected CD4 T cells were incubated with CVL, infected with HIV and cultured. Neither BV-CVL or Normal-CVL had a significant effect on the amount of p24 measured in cultures after five day of culture (data not shown). To determine if higher amounts of HIVBal added to BV CVL-treated MDDC would lead to increased trans -infection, 2X or 4X more HIVBal than were used in the Figure 2 experiments were incubated with MDDC before addition to PBMC. However, increasing the viral inoculum added to BV CVL-treated MDDC did not increase trans -infection over 1X virus (data not shown). BV mucosal fluid decreased HIV infection of MDDC with HIV-1<sub>Bal</sub> To investigate why BV CVL decreased MDDC-mediated trans-infection while LPS increased trans-infection, the level of infection of MDDC was analyzed. Previous reports showed that LPS decreased MDDC infection ( Cavrois et al., 2006 ; Granelli-Piperno et al., 1998 ; McDyer et al., 1999 ). Both the level of productive infection and HIV DNA formation were measured in MDDC after exposure to CVL. Medium-treated MDDC from five different donors produced 2764 pg p24/ml (median) 5 days after infection ( Fig. 3a .). Exposure to either BV CVL or LPS decreased p24 production to 395 and 609 respectively (p<0.001 and p<0.01 Repeated Measures ANOVA). In contrast, p24 production from MDDC exposed to Normal CVL (2005 pg/ml) was not significantly different than medium control. MDDC cultured with AZT was significantly lower than all other treatments at 107 pg/ml (p<0.001). When HIV DNA formation in MDDC from the same five donors was measured, medium-treated MDDC yielded 675 HIV DNA copies/50 ng DNA (median), but in contrast to the results seen with p24 production, LPS and BV CVL did not significantly affect HIV DNA levels ( Fig. 3b .). There was, however, a significant difference between the level of medium treatment and AZT treatment of the MDDC (p<0.01). Effect of BV mucosal fluid on MDDC CCR5, DC-SIGN, PDL-1 and CD54 To further investigate the mechanism for the decreased trans-infection following treatment of MDDC with BV mucosal fluid, expression of CCR5, DC-SIGN, PDL-1 and CD54 were assessed. The level of CCR5 on MDDC was measured as this is a known co-receptor for HIV-1 R5 viruses such as HIV-Bal. However, CCR5 expression was not affected by any of the treatments. CD209 (DC-SIGN), a C-type lectin implicated in HIV trans-infection was decreased on both LPS-treated and BV CVL-treated MDDC when compared to medium-treated MDDC (MFI of 144 and 183 vs. 452 respectively) ( Fig. 4 .). PDL-1 is a costimulatory molecule present on DC that binds PD-1 on T-cells and has been shown to inhibit T-cell proliferation ( Keir, Francisco, and Sharpe, 2007 ). PDL-1 was elevated on LPS-treated MDDC when compared to medium-treated MDDC (MFI 524 vs. 153 respectively). PDL-1 on BV CVL-treated MDDC (MFI 370) was also elevated when compared to medium but was lower than LPS-treated MDDC ( Fig. 4 .). CD54 (ICAM-1) interacts with LFA-1 on T cells and has been implicated as an important surface molecule in HIV trans-infection ( Fortin et al., 1997 ; Sanders et al., 2002 ; Tardif and Tremblay, 2003 ). BV CVL-treated MDDC expressed lower CD54 when compared to LPS treatment of MDDC (MFI of 810 vs. 1560 respectively) ( Fig. 4 .).  Mucosal fluid from women with BV activate MDDC To determine the effect of mucosal secretions on MDDC activation and maturation, MDDCs were cultured with stimuli for 48hr and expression of cell surface CD83 and HLA-DR was determined. Expression of CD83 and HLA-DR were significantly increased due to BV CVL when compared to medium (control) treated MDDC (p=0.0286 and p<0.001 respectively, Mann Whiney test of eight experiments) ( Fig. 1 .). LPS-treated MDDC also had increased levels of CD83 and HLA-DR compared to control, but these levels were not significantly different from BV CVL-treated MDDC. Normal CVL (CVL from women with normal flora – no BV) did not significantly increase CD83 or HLA-DR on MDDC compared to medium-treated MDDC. AnnexinV/PI staining of MDDC was also analyzed following treatments to determine if the MDDC were undergoing apoptosis or cell death. Medium-treated MDDC were 17.3 % positive for Annexin plus PI dual staining. LPS, BV CVL or normal CVL treatment did not significantly increase this level of staining (data not shown).  Mucosal fluid from women with BV activate MDDC To determine the effect of mucosal secretions on MDDC activation and maturation, MDDCs were cultured with stimuli for 48hr and expression of cell surface CD83 and HLA-DR was determined.

Medium-treated MDDC were 17.3 % positive for Annexin plus PI dual staining. LPS, BV CVL or normal CVL treatment did not significantly increase this level of staining (data not shown).  Mucosal fluid from women with BV reduces MDDC-mediated HIV-1<sub>Bal</sub> <italic>trans-</italic>infection of PBMC Previous studies showed that LPS treatment of MDDCs increased HIV trans-infection ( Granelli-Piperno et al., 1998 ; McDonald et al., 2003 ; Sanders et al., 2002 ). Since LPS and BV CVL both induced activation and maturation of MDDC ( Fig. 1 .), we hypothesized that BV CVL would also increase trans -infection. To test this, MDDC from 8 different donors were treated with either Normal CVL or BV CVL were incubated with HIV for 2hrs and then cultured with PHA-stimulated PBMC for five days. Cultures with medium-treated MDDC had median p24 levels of 55,703 pg/ml whereas LPS-treated MDDC had significantly increased levels of p24 at 91,181pg/ml (p=0.0068) ( Fig. 2 .). Unexpectedly, p24 levels from cultures with BV CVL-treated MDDC were significantly lower than medium-treated MDDC (21,835 pg/ml, p=0.001). Cultures with Normal CVL-treated MDDC (44,344 pg/ml) had significantly lower p24 than LPS-treated MDDC (p=0.0068) but were not significantly different than medium-treated MDDC ( Fig. 2 .). AZT treatment of cultures reduced trans-infection to near background levels with median value of 80 pg/ml (p<0.0001). Experiments were also performed to determine if CVL samples had a direct effect on HIV infection of CD4 T cells. Positively selected CD4 T cells were incubated with CVL, infected with HIV and cultured. Neither BV-CVL or Normal-CVL had a significant effect on the amount of p24 measured in cultures after five day of culture (data not shown). To determine if higher amounts of HIVBal added to BV CVL-treated MDDC would lead to increased trans -infection, 2X or 4X more HIVBal than were used in the Figure 2 experiments were incubated with MDDC before addition to PBMC. However, increasing the viral inoculum added to BV CVL-treated MDDC did not increase trans -infection over 1X virus (data not shown).  Mucosal fluid from women with BV reduces MDDC-mediated HIV-1<sub>Bal</sub> <italic>trans-</italic>infection of PBMC Previous studies showed that LPS treatment of MDDCs increased HIV trans-infection ( Granelli-Piperno et al., 1998 ; McDonald et al., 2003 ; Sanders et al., 2002 ).

However, increasing the viral inoculum added to BV CVL-treated MDDC did not increase trans -infection over 1X virus (data not shown).  BV mucosal fluid decreased HIV infection of MDDC with HIV-1<sub>Bal</sub> To investigate why BV CVL decreased MDDC-mediated trans-infection while LPS increased trans-infection, the level of infection of MDDC was analyzed. Previous reports showed that LPS decreased MDDC infection ( Cavrois et al., 2006 ; Granelli-Piperno et al., 1998 ; McDyer et al., 1999 ). Both the level of productive infection and HIV DNA formation were measured in MDDC after exposure to CVL. Medium-treated MDDC from five different donors produced 2764 pg p24/ml (median) 5 days after infection ( Fig. 3a .). Exposure to either BV CVL or LPS decreased p24 production to 395 and 609 respectively (p<0.001 and p<0.01 Repeated Measures ANOVA). In contrast, p24 production from MDDC exposed to Normal CVL (2005 pg/ml) was not significantly different than medium control. MDDC cultured with AZT was significantly lower than all other treatments at 107 pg/ml (p<0.001). When HIV DNA formation in MDDC from the same five donors was measured, medium-treated MDDC yielded 675 HIV DNA copies/50 ng DNA (median), but in contrast to the results seen with p24 production, LPS and BV CVL did not significantly affect HIV DNA levels ( Fig. 3b .). There was, however, a significant difference between the level of medium treatment and AZT treatment of the MDDC (p<0.01).  BV mucosal fluid decreased HIV infection of MDDC with HIV-1<sub>Bal</sub> To investigate why BV CVL decreased MDDC-mediated trans-infection while LPS increased trans-infection, the level of infection of MDDC was analyzed. Previous reports showed that LPS decreased MDDC infection ( Cavrois et al., 2006 ; Granelli-Piperno et al., 1998 ; McDyer et al., 1999 ).

There was, however, a significant difference between the level of medium treatment and AZT treatment of the MDDC (p<0.01).  Effect of BV mucosal fluid on MDDC CCR5, DC-SIGN, PDL-1 and CD54 To further investigate the mechanism for the decreased trans-infection following treatment of MDDC with BV mucosal fluid, expression of CCR5, DC-SIGN, PDL-1 and CD54 were assessed. The level of CCR5 on MDDC was measured as this is a known co-receptor for HIV-1 R5 viruses such as HIV-Bal. However, CCR5 expression was not affected by any of the treatments. CD209 (DC-SIGN), a C-type lectin implicated in HIV trans-infection was decreased on both LPS-treated and BV CVL-treated MDDC when compared to medium-treated MDDC (MFI of 144 and 183 vs. 452 respectively) ( Fig. 4 .).

DISCUSSION Worldwide, women are the fastest growing group of people living with and acquiring HIV-1/AIDS (UNAIDS). Women in sub-Saharan Africa account for approximately 60% of all HIV-1 infected individuals in that region (UNAIDS). Associations between BV and the risk of HIV have been recognized since 1995 ( Cohen et al., 1995 ; Martin et al., 1999 ; Myer et al., 2005 ; Taha et al., 1999 ; Taha et al., 1998 ), but a mechanism for enhanced risk has not been identified. Dendritic cells have been identified as one of the first cell types to be infected with HIV during sexual transmission. DC are abundant in the vaginal submucosa, and recent studies show that mucosal DC have the ability to extend dendrites into the vaginal lumen to sample luminal substances ( Foti, Granucci, and Ricciardi-Castagnoli, 2004 ). Our previous studies show that MDDC are activated and matured following incubation with mucosal fluid from women with BV. We therefore hypothesized that similar to LPS, exposure to BV CVL would increase the level of HIV trans-infection. Surprisingly, we found a decrease of trans-infection. Following activation of MDDC with BV CVL there was also decreased productive infection of MDDC and there was no significant change in the level of infection as measured by HIV DNA content at 24 hr. These latter two results suggest that for BV CVL-treated MDDC, that at least a part of the lower trans-infection may be due to lower “second phase” virus transfer to T cells that occurs between 24 and 72 hrs post virus pulse described by Turville et al. ( Turville et al., 2004 ). Second phase inhibition would be consistent with others who have made the observation for the need of infection of DCs prior to transfer to CD4+ lymphocytes ( Kawamura et al., 2000 ; Kawamura et al., 2003 ; Pope et al., 1995 ; Reece et al., 1998 ). MDDC can be induced to mature into different types of DC as shown by Sanders et al. ( Sanders et al., 2002 ) who demonstrated that incubation of MDDC with varying stimuli induces maturation to either a Th1 promoting effector DC (DC1), Th2 promoting effector DC (DC2) or a DC type with features of both (DC0) ( Sanders et al., 2002 ). It was further shown that these MDDC subtypes had differing abilities to be infected by and transfer HIV. A decrease in both infection of MDDC and transfer of HIV from MDDC to T cells was shown by McDyer et al. ( McDyer et al., 1999 ) when MDDC were exposed to CD40LT which induced decreased reverse transcriptase activity in a CC-chemokine dependent fashion. Our results along with these previously published reports indicate that different stimuli can have very different effects on HIV trans -infection elicited by DC. Women with BV have a large variety of bacteria in their vaginal microbiota. These bacteria are both gram negative (LPS) and gram positive (peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid) and therefore have components for stimulation via TLR4 and TLR2 respectively. Previous studies in our lab show that the TLR2 pathway is preferentially stimulated by BV mucosal fluids suggesting the involvement of gram positive products or other TLR2 ligands that could be inducing the maturation of the MDDC ( Mares et al., 2007 ). It has been reported that lipoprotein (another TLR2 ligand) stimulation of MDDC induces high levels of IL-12 ( Thoma-Uszynski et al., 2000 ). We speculate that stimulation via TLR2 ligands may induce activation/maturation of MDDC to a DC2 phenotype and this phenotype is known to be less prone to infection and viral transfer ( Sanders et al., 2002 ). Thus, CD54 (ICAM-1) was only slightly increased on the BV CVL-stimulated MDDC compared to medium alone. ICAM-1 is important for LFA-1 ICAM-1 interaction/cross talk between T cells and MDDC and was shown by Sanders et al. ( Sanders et al., 2002 ) to be a cell to cell interaction that is important for HIV transmission between MDDC and T cells. Our findings would suggest that the increased risk of HIV transmission in women with BV is not due to stimulation of DC resulting in enhanced trans-infection. However, it is possible that DC activation by BV could local activation of T-cells which could increase HIV susceptibility. DC that become activated and matured by mucosal secretions from women with BV, secrete elevated levels of IL-12p70 and IL-23 ( St John et al., 2007 ) and may express elevated levels of other cytokines such as IL1?, IL-1?, IL-6, IL-7, IL-15, IL-18, TNF? and TNF? ( de Saint-Vis et al., 1998 ) that could contribute to the activation of T cells. IL-7 is of particular note because IL-7 from DC induces the activation of T-cells ( Managlia, Landay, and Al-Harthi, 2005 ; Vasir et al., 2005 ), and furthermore naïve T-cells pre-incubated with IL-7 can be productively infected with HIV ( Managlia, Landay, and Al-Harthi, 2006 ). A recent publication by Kawamura et al. ( Kawamura et al., 2008 ) shows that of three DC subsets identified in human epithelial skin emigrants, Langerhans cells (LC) accounted for greater than 95% of HIV dissemination. Therefore, LC may be the critical cell initiating virus dissemination from the epithelial layers to cells of the sub-epithelium and LC could react differently to BV mucosal secretions than do DC, as they are a different subset of DC with unique features and location. LC are located within the epithelial layer of mucosal tissues at levels of between 2 and 4 percent of the total cells present and express Langerin (CD207), CD1ahigh and have presence of Birbeck granules ( Edwards and Morris, 1985 ; Piguet and Steinman, 2007 ). In conclusion, we observed that vaginal mucosal fluid from women with BV causes DC to reach a matured and activated state, but that these cells have decreased ability to mediate trans- infection of T-cells. The data indicate the need for further research into the effects BV has on HIV target cells present in the lower genital tract that have possible involvement in BV-associated HIV acquisition.
