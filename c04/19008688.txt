MANAGEMENT OF LOWER EXTREMITY PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE  SUMMARY PAD is a common disorder with increasing prevalence in the elderly population. Conservative management of patients with asymptomatic PAD and patients with intermittent claudication is recommended to modify risk factors and improve ambulatory ability, while patients with more severe PAD typically require revascularization of the lower extremities. Exercise rehabilitation is a highly effective, conservative treatment to improve ambulation in patients with intermittent claudication. To date, the primary focus of attention on the benefits of exercise rehabilitation has centered on the increase in walking distances to onset and to maximal claudication pain during a treadmill test. Future research should focus on the improvement in other functional outcomes which may be more representative of everyday activities such as submaximal exercise performance, walking economy, balance, flexibility, and lower extremity strength. Until these measures are obtained, the full benefit of exercise rehabilitation for PAD patients remains undefined.

Intensity Initially, 50% of peak exercise capacity, with gradual progression to 80% by the end of the program. Duration Initially, 15 minutes of exercise per session, with gradual progression to 40–50 minutes by the end of the program. Mode Weight bearing (e.g., walking, stair climbing). Nonweight-bearing tasks (e.g., bicycling) may be used for warming up and cooling down. Type of Exercise Intermittent walking to a claudication pain score of 3 using a 4-point pain scale. Program Length Approximately 6 months.
