The Challenges of Colorectal Cancer Survivorship With advances in treatment, colorectal cancer is being transformed from a deadly disease to an illness that is increasingly curable. With this transformation has come increased interest in the unique problems, risks, needs, and concerns of survivors who have completed treatment and are cancer-free. Research has shown that physical and mental quality of life for colorectal cancer survivors was inferior when compared with age-matched individuals without cancer. Although issues and symptoms were most prominent during the first three years, long-term effects of treatment can persist and include fatigue, sleep difficulty, fear of recurrence, anxiety, depression, negative body image, sensory neuropathy, gastrointestinal problems, urinary incontinence, and sexual dysfunction. The unique challenges and issues of colorectal cancer survivors can and should be addressed by health care providers and the research community to ensure effective interventions and models of care to manage these problems. In this review, we discuss what is known about the long-term effects of colorectal cancer treatment on quality of life, the care of survivors, and existing models of survivorship care.  Conclusion Survivorship is a distinct phase of colorectal cancer treatment. Goals of care include surveillance for recurrence, management of late and long-term toxicities associated with multimodality treatment, encouragement of healthy diet and lifestyle behaviors, and adherence to recommended preventive care guidelines. Coordination of care, including the use of a survivorship care plan, is paramount to ensuring longevity. Further research evaluating issues specific to CRC survivorship and potential interventions need to be a priority.
