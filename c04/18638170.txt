Guidelines for the prevention of central venous catheter-related blood stream infections with prostanoid therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension SUMMARY Intravenous prostanoids are the backbone of therapy for advanced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and have improved long-term outcome and quality of life. Currently, two prostanoids are approved by the US Food and Drug administration for parenteral administration: epoprostenol (Flolan) and treprostinil (Remodulin). Chronic intravenous therapy presents considerable challenges for patients and caregivers who must learn sterile preparation of the medication, operation of the pump, and care of the central venous catheter. Patients are routinely counseled and advised regarding the risks of CR-BSIs and catheter care before central line insertion. Central line infections as well as bacteremia are well documented risks of chronic intravenous therapy and may significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality. Recent reports have suggested a possible increase in CR-BSI; therefore, the Scientific Leadership Council of the Pulmonary Hypertension Association decided to provide guidelines for good clinical practice regarding catheter care. Although data exits regarding patients with central venous catheters and the risk of blood stream infections in patients with cancer or other disorders, there is little data regarding the special needs of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension requiring central venous access. These guidelines are extrapolated from the diverse body of literature regarding central venous catheter care.
