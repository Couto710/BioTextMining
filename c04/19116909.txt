Association of the IL2RA/CD25 gene with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) Objective The interleukin 2 receptor alpha ( IL2RA/CD25 ) gene is emerging as a general susceptibility gene for autoimmune diseases due to its role in development and function of T regulatory cells and the association of SNPs within this gene with type 1 diabetes, Graves' disease, RA and multiple sclerosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether SNPs within the IL2RA/CD25 gene are associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Methods Three SNPs within the IL2RA/CD25 gene, that showed previous evidence for association with either rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or type 1 diabetes, were selected for genotyping in UK JIA cases (n=654) and controls (n=3849). Data for one SNP (rs2104286) was also available from North American JIA cases (n=747) and controls (n=1161). Association analysis was performed using PLINK. Results The SNP (rs2104286) within the IL2RA/CD25 gene was significantly associated with UK JIA cases (allelic OR 0.76 95% CI 0.66-0.88, trend p=0.0002). A second SNP (rs41295061) also showed modest evidence for association with JIA (OR 0.80 95% CI 0.63-1.0, p=0.05). Association with rs2104286 was convincingly replicated in a second JIA cohort (OR 0.84 95% CI 0.65-1.0, trend p=0.05). Meta-analysis of the two cohorts yielded highly significant evidence for association (OR 0.76 95% CI 0.62-0.88, p=4.9 × 10?6). Conclusion These results provide strong evidence that the IL2RA/CD25 gene represents a JIA susceptibility locus. Further investigation of the gene using both genetic and functional approaches is now required.

Materials and Methods Subjects DNA was available for 654 UK Caucasian JIA patients from the British Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Rheumatology (BSPAR) National Repository of JIA. JIA cases were classified according to ILAR criteria( 15 ). This is a combined set of all ILAR subtypes including systemic-onset JIA (n=115), persistent (n=194) and extended oligoarthritis (n=86) subtypes, rheumatoid negative (n=138) and rheumatoid positive (n=35) polyarthritis subtypes, enthesitis-related JIA (n=28), psoriatic JIA (n=51) and cases with peripheral synovitis, which could not be classified (n=7). Healthy Caucasian control DNA samples were available from 5 centres in the UK( 16 ) : Manchester 924 controls; Sheffield 995 controls; Leeds 532 controls; Aberdeen 862 controls; Oxford 536 controls, total control sample size = 3849. All individuals were recruited with ethical approval and provided informed consent [North-West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee (MREC 99/8/84) and the University of Manchester Committee on the Ethics of Research on Human Beings]. Three IL2RA/CD25 SNPs were selected for investigation: rs2104286, the marker at the IL2RA/CD25 locus most strongly associated with RA in WTCCC GWA study and also associated with MS. In addition, rs41295061 and rs11594656, the most significantly associated SNP from each of the two independent groups of SNPs identified in the T1D fine mapping study of IL2RA/CD25, were selected and all were genotyped in UK JIA cases and controls. Genotyping for the UK cohort was performed using the Sequenom iPLEX platform. A 90% sample quality control rate and 95% SNP genotyping success rate was imposed on the analysis. Genotype data for SNP rs2104286 for controls was combined with the data for that SNP obtained from the WTCCC GWA study( 8 ) giving a total control sample size of 6787. Genotype and allele frequencies were compared between cases with JIA and controls using STATA version 9 SE (StataCorp, Texas, USA) and PLINK( 17 ). Stratification by ILAR subtype, ANA antibody status and gender was performed. A second cohort comprising 747 Caucasian North American JIA patients and 1161 Caucasian North American controls was also studied. The majority of the cases were recruited at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. The medical and clinical data for these samples are available in the Pediatric Rheumatology research registry maintained within the William S. Rowe Division of Rheumatology. The remaining samples were recruited from collaborating centers across the US. These collections include the NIAMS supported JIA affected sibpair registry, a national collection of multiplex families including sample collections and clinical information. All patients satisfy ILAR criteria for JIA (assigned retrospectively and therefore for the purposes of this study, a patient was considered rheumatoid factor negative on the basis of a single test). JIA patients are comprised of persistent oligoarthritis (n=325), extended oligoarthritis (n=105), rheumatoid factor positive polyarthritis (n=4), rheumatoid factor negative polyarthritis (n=312) and systemic onset (n=1). US JIA cases had previously been genotyped for one of the IL2RA/CD25 SNPs, rs2104286, as part of a genome wide association study of JIA utilising the Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Mapping 500K array. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Appropriate consent was obtained from subjects and family members or an IRB exemption was granted for legacy samples which predated the current consent process and which are now de-identified. The controls comprised 1161 individuals from the New York Cancer Project. The rs2104286 SNP had not been genotyped directly but the imputed genotypes were inferred from multimarker combinations. Only samples with a greater than 95% confidence score for their imputed genotypes were included( 18 ). Genotype and allele frequencies were compared between cases and controls. Conditional logistic regression was performed using PLINK. Haplotype analysis was performed using Haploview version 4.0 ( 19 ) In addition, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to perform a meta-analysis of the two cohorts and a test for heterogeneity between cohorts was carried out using the Breslow-Day test.

Results All SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the UK and North American control cohorts. In the UK cohort the SNP, rs2104286, within the IL2RA/CD25 gene was associated with JIA (allelic OR 0.76 95% CI 0.66-0.88, trend p=0.0002) ( Table 1 ). JIA is a phenotypically heterogeneous disease, with a female predominance and association with the presence of ANA autoantibodies. Stratification analysis was therefore performed by ILAR subtype, for gender and presence or absence of ANA autoantibodies. Analysis stratifying by ILAR subtype ( Table 2 ) showed that the association was strongest in both the persistent (allelic OR 0.69 95% CI 0.53-0.89, trend p=0.005) and extended oligoarthritis (allelic OR 0.53 95% CI 0.35-0.81, trend p=0.003) subtypes. The association of rs2104286 was also stronger in the ANA positive subgroup (allelic OR 0.65 95% CI 0.49-0.86, trend p=0.002) and the female cases (allelic OR 0.76 95% CI 0.64-0.91, trend p=0.002) compared with controls ( Table 2 ). Association analysis of the two T1D-associated IL2RA/CD25 SNPs revealed that only one SNP, rs41295061, showed borderline evidence for association with JIA when compared to controls (allelic OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.63-1.0, trend p=0.05) ( Table 1 ). Analysis stratifying by ILAR subtype ( Table 2 ) showed no statistically significant difference between the subtypes. Logistic regression analysis conditioning on the most associated SNP, rs2104286, suggests that this SNP accounts for the association with JIA and that the association with rs41295061 is not an independent association but due to LD with rs2104286 (p-value for rs41295061 after conditioning on rs2104286 is 0.62), despite only moderate correlation (r2=0.27). Haplotype analysis for the two SNPs showed that the haplotype of the two major alleles of both SNPs were over-represented in cases compared to controls (p-value = 0.0035 OR=0.77 95% CI 0.58-0.93) with an odds ratio similar to that for the single marker association (OR=0.77 95% CI 0.66-0.88). Genotype frequencies in the North American cases were similar to those found in the UK cohort. Comparison of genotype frequencies between North American cases and controls provides further evidence for association of rs2104286 with JIA (allelic OR 0.84 95% CI 0.65-1.0, trend p= 0.05) ( Table 3 ). Stratification by ILAR subtype was performed and the association was strongest in the persistent oligoarthritis subtype (allelic OR 0.69 95% CI 0.55-0.87, trend p=0.007) ( Table 4 ). There was no significant evidence for heterogeneity between the UK and North American datasets, and meta-analysis of the two cohorts yielded highly significant evidence for association (OR 0.76 95% CI 0.62-0.88, p=4.9 × 10?6).  Results All SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the UK and North American control cohorts. In the UK cohort the SNP, rs2104286, within the IL2RA/CD25 gene was associated with JIA (allelic OR 0.76 95% CI 0.66-0.88, trend p=0.0002) ( Table 1 ).

Discussion In this study we have found significant evidence for association of a polymorphism within the IL2RA/CD25 gene with JIA in two independent cohorts. SNPs within the IL2RA/CD25 gene have previously been associated with a number of other autoimmune diseases including T1D( 10 ), Graves' disease( 20 ), and MS( 9 ). In addition a rare mutation of the IL2RA/CD25 gene can lead to the development of a severe autoimmune disease characterised by decreased numbers of peripheral T cells displaying abnormal proliferation, extensive lymphocytic infiltration of tissues accompanied by tissue atrophy and inflammation, but normal B-cell development( 21 ). The finding of association with JIA further extends the evidence that variation across this gene predisposes to autoimmunity in general. The concept of ‘autoimmune genes’ is not novel; previous analysis of linkage studies in a number of autoimmune diseases showed evidence of overlap between regions of linkage( 22 ). Furthermore, there is precedent for this because the PTPN22 gene has been associated with a variety of autoimmune diseases although, interestingly and unlike the IL2RA/CD25 gene, not with MS. Three SNPs were selected for genotyping based on their association with other autoimmune disease and two of these SNPS were associated with JIA in the current study. The strongest effect was seen with rs2104286 (OR for minor allele 0.76 95% CI 0.66-0.88) which is comparable to the ORs calculated for MS (OR 0.81 95% CI 0.74-0.89) and RA (OR 0.81 95% CI0.73-0.89). This SNP maps to intron 1 of the IL2RA/CD25 gene; this SNP was selected for genotyping because recent GWA studies of both RA and MS found association of the same variant (rs2104286). In addition, the MS study also found association with a SNP in strong LD with it, rs12722489( 9 ). The other two SNPs genotyped in this study of JIA were selected on the basis of the recent studies of the IL2RA/CD25 region in TID in which fine mapping studies detected association with two independent groups of SNPs spanning overlapping regions of 14 and 40kb, encompassing IL2RA/CD25 intron 1 and the 5? intergenic region between IL2RA/CD25 and RBM17 . The first region contains a group of eight genetically indistinguishable SNPs, the most strongly associated being rs41295061 whilst the second group comprised three indistinguishable SNPs, the most strongly associated being rs11594656. Both of these SNPs are potentially functional given that genotypes at each have been correlated with lower concentrations of soluble IL2RA/CD25. This suggests that a reduction in immune activation may predispose to T1D( 10 ) and, indeed, other autoimmune diseases. Interestingly in this study only one of the two T1D SNPs (rs4125061) showed weak association with JIA. The evidence for association with this SNP was stronger when genotype frequencies from the JIA cases are compared with the large TID control cohort (n=6855)( 10 ) (allelic OR 0.69 95% CI 0.55-0.85, genotypic p=0.002), whilst that of the second SNP (rs11594656) remains non-significant (allelic OR 0.94 95% CI 0.82-1.08, genotypic p=0.4). Association of the intron 1 T1D (rs4125061) SNP with JIA was not as strong as with rs2104286, and this association requires validation in an additional cohort. Hence, it will be vital to determine whether genotype at the rs2104286 locus also correlates with soluble IL2RA/CD25 levels or any other functional affect. Examination of LD between the SNPs tested in this study suggests that there is low LD between rs2104286 and the two SNPs (rs4125061 and rs11594656) identified in the T1D fine-mapping study (r2 =0.27 and 0.03 respectively), however logistic regression analysis of the three SNPs conditioning on the most associated SNP, rs2104286, suggests that is the SNP driving the association with JIA. The association with rs41295061 is due to LD with rs2104286. Further investigation of SNPs across the IL2RA/CD25 gene will now be required to identify the causal variant. The association with rs2104286 was confirmed in an independent cohort of North American JIA cases and controls (OR 0.84 95%CI 0.65-0.99, trend p=0.05). Meta-analysis of the two datasets strengthened the effect (OR 0.76 95% CI 0.62-0.88, p =4.9 ×10?6) thereby providing further support for the role of IL2RA/CD25 in susceptibility to JIA. False positive associations can arise as a result of population stratification. The WTCCC study previously established that there was very little evidence of this across the UK. We have not tested for population stratification in the North American data. However, there was no evidence of heterogeneity between the two populations as assessed by the Breslow-Day test. Plus the fact that the genotype/allele frequencies for the associated markers are very similar in the UK and the North American case and control populations suggests that the association detected is genuine. JIA is a phenotypically heterogeneous disease. Thus, although it may be argued that stratification analysis may result in inflated type 1 error rates because of multiple testing, the creation of more homogenous subgroups may increase the power to detect association. In the current study, evidence for association with rs2104286 was strongest in the oligoarthritis subtypes, females and JIA cases with ANA autoantibody present. The association with all these subgroups is not surprising as the phenotypes are correlated. The same subgroup effect does appear to be true for rs41295061. However, it should be noted that the small sample sizes in some of the ILAR subtypes may have limited the ability to draw robust conclusions about association of the IL2RA/CD25 SNPs with those phenotypes. Comparison of rs2104286 SNP allele frequencies between the 5 subtypes suggests that they are not statistically different (p=0.28). Therefore larger sample sizes will be required to be able to clarify association across the individual subtypes. The IL2RA/CD25 gene was a strong candidate JIA susceptibility gene not only because of the previous evidence for association with a variety of other autoimmune diseases but because of its role in the T cell signalling pathway, thought to play a key role in mediating the inflammatory autoimmune response in JIA. IL2, the T cell growth factor, exerts its effect on T cells through the binding with the IL2 receptor (IL2R). The IL2R is composed of three chains, alpha, beta and gamma, the alpha chain being encoded by the IL2RA/CD25 gene. The alpha and beta chains are involved in the binding of IL2 and the beta and gamma chains are involved in signal transduction once IL2 has bound. IL2RA/CD25 is central to immune regulation via its role in the development and function of regulatory T cells. These cells are increasingly seen as playing a central role in self-tolerance. CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells suppress activated T cells and this immune suppression is vital in preventing autoimmune diseases. Hence, variation in the gene encoding IL2RA/CD25 could have profound effects in predisposing to autoimmune disease. A recent study has investigated CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells in children with persistent oligoarthritis (1-4 joints affected at diagnosis and throughout disease course) and extended oligoarthritis (a more destructive disease course in which the number of joints affected increases beyond 4 within 6 months of disease onset), hypothesising that T regulatory cells may play a role in the reversal of the autoimmune disease process in persistent oligoarthritis JIA cases. It was shown that the number of CD4+CD25bright Treg cells at the site of inflammation i.e. the joints, was enriched compared to the number in the peripheral blood. In addition there was a greater frequency of CD4+CD25bright Treg cells in persistent oligoarthritis cases compared to extended oligoarthritis cases. The CD4+CD25bright Treg cells in the synovial fluid showed higher expression of many activation markers such as FOXP3, CTLA4 and HLA-DR suggesting they are more functionally mature than those in the peripheral blood. They also showed, in vitro, an increased suppressive capacity compared to those from the peripheral blood ( 23 ). A more recent study also found that the ratio of Treg cells to activated T cells was higher in patients with oligoarthritis compared to those with polyarthritis ( 24 ). Similar findings have been found for RA with higher numbers of Treg cells with concomitant increased suppressive activity found in SF compared to peripheral blood ( 25 ). Therefore there appears to be functional differences in T regulatory cells across JIA subtypes. Interestingly when the IL2RA/CD25 SNPs were analysed by subtype the strongest association was in both oligoarthritis subtype, though limited sample size in some of the other subtypes makes conclusions about subtype specific associations difficult. Future work will aim to look at correlation between T regulatory cell function and IL2RA/CD25 genotype. The IL2 receptor has already been a potential target for immunologic therapy in autoimmune disease. For example, IL2 directed immunotherapies have been successful in ameliorating the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis( 26 ). In human MS, a monoclonal antibody which binds to the alpha chain of the IL2R has been shown to have some therapeutic benefits, though its mechanism of action is unknown( 27 ). In summary, we have identified a putative novel JIA susceptibility gene; IL2RA/CD25 . The association of IL2RA/CD25 with a fifth autoimmune disease suggests that this gene, along with the PTPN22 gene, appears to play a vital role in immune regulation and function and predisposition to autoimmunity in general. Further investigation of the gene using both genetic and functional approaches is now required.  Discussion In this study we have found significant evidence for association of a polymorphism within the IL2RA/CD25 gene with JIA in two independent cohorts. SNPs within the IL2RA/CD25 gene have previously been associated with a number of other autoimmune diseases including T1D( 10 ), Graves' disease( 20 ), and MS( 9 ).

Furthermore, there is precedent for this because the PTPN22 gene has been associated with a variety of autoimmune diseases although, interestingly and unlike the IL2RA/CD25 gene, not with MS. Three SNPs were selected for genotyping based on their association with other autoimmune disease and two of these SNPS were associated with JIA in the current study. The strongest effect was seen with rs2104286 (OR for minor allele 0.76 95% CI 0.66-0.88) which is comparable to the ORs calculated for MS (OR 0.81 95% CI 0.74-0.89) and RA (OR 0.81 95% CI0.73-0.89). This SNP maps to intron 1 of the IL2RA/CD25 gene; this SNP was selected for genotyping because recent GWA studies of both RA and MS found association of the same variant (rs2104286). In addition, the MS study also found association with a SNP in strong LD with it, rs12722489( 9 ). The other two SNPs genotyped in this study of JIA were selected on the basis of the recent studies of the IL2RA/CD25 region in TID in which fine mapping studies detected association with two independent groups of SNPs spanning overlapping regions of 14 and 40kb, encompassing IL2RA/CD25 intron 1 and the 5? intergenic region between IL2RA/CD25 and RBM17 . The first region contains a group of eight genetically indistinguishable SNPs, the most strongly associated being rs41295061 whilst the second group comprised three indistinguishable SNPs, the most strongly associated being rs11594656. Both of these SNPs are potentially functional given that genotypes at each have been correlated with lower concentrations of soluble IL2RA/CD25. This suggests that a reduction in immune activation may predispose to T1D( 10 ) and, indeed, other autoimmune diseases. Interestingly in this study only one of the two T1D SNPs (rs4125061) showed weak association with JIA. The evidence for association with this SNP was stronger when genotype frequencies from the JIA cases are compared with the large TID control cohort (n=6855)( 10 ) (allelic OR 0.69 95% CI 0.55-0.85, genotypic p=0.002), whilst that of the second SNP (rs11594656) remains non-significant (allelic OR 0.94 95% CI 0.82-1.08, genotypic p=0.4). Association of the intron 1 T1D (rs4125061) SNP with JIA was not as strong as with rs2104286, and this association requires validation in an additional cohort. Hence, it will be vital to determine whether genotype at the rs2104286 locus also correlates with soluble IL2RA/CD25 levels or any other functional affect. Examination of LD between the SNPs tested in this study suggests that there is low LD between rs2104286 and the two SNPs (rs4125061 and rs11594656) identified in the T1D fine-mapping study (r2 =0.27 and 0.03 respectively), however logistic regression analysis of the three SNPs conditioning on the most associated SNP, rs2104286, suggests that is the SNP driving the association with JIA. The association with rs41295061 is due to LD with rs2104286. Further investigation of SNPs across the IL2RA/CD25 gene will now be required to identify the causal variant. The association with rs2104286 was confirmed in an independent cohort of North American JIA cases and controls (OR 0.84 95%CI 0.65-0.99, trend p=0.05). Meta-analysis of the two datasets strengthened the effect (OR 0.76 95% CI 0.62-0.88, p =4.9 ×10?6) thereby providing further support for the role of IL2RA/CD25 in susceptibility to JIA. False positive associations can arise as a result of population stratification. The WTCCC study previously established that there was very little evidence of this across the UK. We have not tested for population stratification in the North American data. However, there was no evidence of heterogeneity between the two populations as assessed by the Breslow-Day test. Plus the fact that the genotype/allele frequencies for the associated markers are very similar in the UK and the North American case and control populations suggests that the association detected is genuine. JIA is a phenotypically heterogeneous disease. Thus, although it may be argued that stratification analysis may result in inflated type 1 error rates because of multiple testing, the creation of more homogenous subgroups may increase the power to detect association. In the current study, evidence for association with rs2104286 was strongest in the oligoarthritis subtypes, females and JIA cases with ANA autoantibody present. The association with all these subgroups is not surprising as the phenotypes are correlated. The same subgroup effect does appear to be true for rs41295061. However, it should be noted that the small sample sizes in some of the ILAR subtypes may have limited the ability to draw robust conclusions about association of the IL2RA/CD25 SNPs with those phenotypes. Comparison of rs2104286 SNP allele frequencies between the 5 subtypes suggests that they are not statistically different (p=0.28). Therefore larger sample sizes will be required to be able to clarify association across the individual subtypes. The IL2RA/CD25 gene was a strong candidate JIA susceptibility gene not only because of the previous evidence for association with a variety of other autoimmune diseases but because of its role in the T cell signalling pathway, thought to play a key role in mediating the inflammatory autoimmune response in JIA. IL2, the T cell growth factor, exerts its effect on T cells through the binding with the IL2 receptor (IL2R). The IL2R is composed of three chains, alpha, beta and gamma, the alpha chain being encoded by the IL2RA/CD25 gene. The alpha and beta chains are involved in the binding of IL2 and the beta and gamma chains are involved in signal transduction once IL2 has bound. IL2RA/CD25 is central to immune regulation via its role in the development and function of regulatory T cells. These cells are increasingly seen as playing a central role in self-tolerance. CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells suppress activated T cells and this immune suppression is vital in preventing autoimmune diseases. Hence, variation in the gene encoding IL2RA/CD25 could have profound effects in predisposing to autoimmune disease. A recent study has investigated CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells in children with persistent oligoarthritis (1-4 joints affected at diagnosis and throughout disease course) and extended oligoarthritis (a more destructive disease course in which the number of joints affected increases beyond 4 within 6 months of disease onset), hypothesising that T regulatory cells may play a role in the reversal of the autoimmune disease process in persistent oligoarthritis JIA cases. It was shown that the number of CD4+CD25bright Treg cells at the site of inflammation i.e. the joints, was enriched compared to the number in the peripheral blood. In addition there was a greater frequency of CD4+CD25bright Treg cells in persistent oligoarthritis cases compared to extended oligoarthritis cases. The CD4+CD25bright Treg cells in the synovial fluid showed higher expression of many activation markers such as FOXP3, CTLA4 and HLA-DR suggesting they are more functionally mature than those in the peripheral blood. They also showed, in vitro, an increased suppressive capacity compared to those from the peripheral blood ( 23 ). A more recent study also found that the ratio of Treg cells to activated T cells was higher in patients with oligoarthritis compared to those with polyarthritis ( 24 ). Similar findings have been found for RA with higher numbers of Treg cells with concomitant increased suppressive activity found in SF compared to peripheral blood ( 25 ). Therefore there appears to be functional differences in T regulatory cells across JIA subtypes. Interestingly when the IL2RA/CD25 SNPs were analysed by subtype the strongest association was in both oligoarthritis subtype, though limited sample size in some of the other subtypes makes conclusions about subtype specific associations difficult. Future work will aim to look at correlation between T regulatory cell function and IL2RA/CD25 genotype. The IL2 receptor has already been a potential target for immunologic therapy in autoimmune disease. For example, IL2 directed immunotherapies have been successful in ameliorating the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis( 26 ). In human MS, a monoclonal antibody which binds to the alpha chain of the IL2R has been shown to have some therapeutic benefits, though its mechanism of action is unknown( 27 ). In summary, we have identified a putative novel JIA susceptibility gene; IL2RA/CD25 . The association of IL2RA/CD25 with a fifth autoimmune disease suggests that this gene, along with the PTPN22 gene, appears to play a vital role in immune regulation and function and predisposition to autoimmunity in general. Further investigation of the gene using both genetic and functional approaches is now required.
