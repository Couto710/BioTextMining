HIV Stigma and Nurse Job Satisfaction in Five African Counties This study explored the demographic and social factors, including perceived HIV stigma, that influence job satisfaction in nurses from 5 African countries. A cross-sectional survey was conducted of nurses ( n = 1,384) caring for patients living with HIV infection in Lesotho, Malawi, South Africa, Swaziland, and Tanzania. Total job satisfaction in this sample was lower than 2 comparable studies in South Africa and the United Kingdom. The subscale, Personal Satisfaction, was the highest in this sample as in the other 2. Job Satisfaction scores differed significantly among the 5 countries and these differences were consistent across all subscales. A hierarchical regression demonstrated that mental and physical health, marital status, education level, urban/rural setting, and perceived HIV stigma had significant influences on job satisfaction. Perceived HIV stigma was the strongest predictor of job dissatisfaction. These findings provide new areas for intervention strategies that might enhance the work environment for nurses in these countries.  Results Sample Description The average age of the sample participants ( n = 1,384) was 37.9 years ( SD = 9.56). Eighty-eight percent of the sample ( n = 1,218) was female, 58.3% ( n = 809) were married, 69.5% ( n = 964) had a certificate/diploma level of education (non-degree training program), and 69.2% ( n = 961) were working in urban areas. The lowest levels of job satisfaction were reported for Pay and Prospects ( M = 1.76) and Training ( M = 1.81), and the highest levels of job satisfaction were associated with Personal Satisfaction ( M = 2.77) and Professional Support ( M = 2.56; See Table 1 ). The obtained measures of internal reliability estimates in this sample ranged from 0.84–0.89, similar to those reported by Traynor and Wade (1993) in the original study of nurses at the Royal College, England. There were significant differences among the mean satisfaction scores for the different dimensions ( F = 749.35; df = 4, 1360; p < .0001; ? 2 = .69). Differences in job satisfaction scores by country were explored through a series of one-way ANOVAs (See Table 2 ). All effects were significant ( p < .0001) and the effects for these differences were substantial, with 17% of the variance in Total Job Satisfaction scores being accounted for by country differences. Nurses in South Africa and Tanzania obtained higher mean job satisfaction scores for all dimensions of job satisfaction than nurses in the other three countries. Nurses in Lesotho reported the lowest levels of job satisfaction. Country level differences on the job satisfaction subscales were consistent. Correlation analysis demonstrated that the dimensions of job satisfaction were strongly correlated with each other (0.39 to 0.61) and were very strongly correlated with the total job satisfaction score (0.66 to 0.82). On the basis of these findings, we focused further analyses on total job satisfaction. To explore the correlates of job satisfaction, we categorized variables into three sets, including personal characteristics (age, gender, MCS, PCS, marital status, education), setting characteristics (type of work unit, work location, years of experience as a nurse), and perceived HIV stigma. The descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations of these predictor variables are presented in Table 3 . Age and gender were unrelated to job satisfaction; but job satisfaction was positively correlated with mental quality of life ( r = .23) and physical quality of life ( r = .08). Married nurses had lower quality of life than unmarried nurses ( r = ?.10), and nurses with higher levels of education (advanced diploma, degree, and postgraduate) were more satisfied than nurses with lower levels of education (certificate and diploma) ( r = ?.11). Location was the only work setting variable that was correlated with job satisfaction. Nurses working in urban settings reported higher job satisfaction than nurses in peri-urban or rural contexts ( r = .10). Perceived HIV stigma was observed to be strongly correlated with job satisfaction ( r = ?0.22). High levels of perceived HIV stigma were correlated with low levels of job satisfaction in this sample. We conducted hierarchical regression analysis to construct a model of the predictors of job satisfaction. We compared three models. The first included the four personal characteristics that were correlated with job satisfaction (MCS, PCS, marital status, education) only. The second model included the personal characteristics and work location; and the third model included all predictors including stigma. Each model significantly improved the overall fit; and the addition of stigma in the final stage of analysis resulted in a substantial improvement to the R-square ( Tables 4 and 5 ). The final model was significant ( F = 33.45; df = 6, 1158; p < .0001). These findings demonstrate that perceived HIV stigma makes an independent and negative contribution to job satisfaction, over and above variables related to personal and work setting characteristics. All of the variables that were entered in the first two stages remained significant predictors after the later variables were entered. Perceived HIV stigma proved to be the strongest predictor of job dissatisfaction followed by mental health quality of life.

Discussion The average job satisfaction in this sample was lower than that reported by Uys, Minnaar, Reid, and Naidoo (2004) in a sample of South African nurses. Out of a possible score of 190, this sample reported a mean job satisfaction of 86.7 and Uys et al. reported a mean of 113.6. This finding may suggest that nurses have become more dissatisfied with their positions over the past few years and may reflect a cumulative impact of staff shortages and out-migration, as discussed by Kingma (2007) . The sub-scale, Personal Satisfaction, was the highest scored factor reported by this sample from five countries in Africa and is similar to the results reported by Traynor and Wade (1993) in the United Kingdom and Uys et al. (2004) in South Africa. The rank-order of the sub-scales of job satisfaction is similar among these three samples with satisfaction with Pay and Prospects and Training being the lowest. Strategies designed to improve job satisfaction among nurses may take into account these ranking of factors, but since all categories are extremely low, such intervention strategies should probably not over-emphasize the order but focus on all aspects. The similar pattern and statistical significance of differences among the five countries of the nurses’ job satisfaction scores and their perceived HIV stigma scores is challenging. This relationship contradicts Bellani et al. (1996) who reported no relationship between burnout and stigma in an Italian study. This difference may be related to the fact that he used a more general AIDS impact instrument and not a culturally sensitive measure of perceived HIV stigma validated on the same population of nurses. The strength of the influence of stigma on job satisfaction is clearly illustrated in the hierarchical regression model and this makes an important contribution to our understanding of job satisfaction in countries where HIV infection is at epidemic levels. Five demographic factors were significantly related to job satisfaction – mental and physical quality of life, marital status, educational level, and work location (urban/rural). While the correlations were low, they were all significant. Job dissatisfaction is more commonly explained by factors such as salaries, working conditions, availability of supplies, and opportunities for advancement. This is the first study to demonstrate that a small, but predictable amount of variance in job dissatisfaction was due to HIV stigma. Greater job satisfaction was related to feeling healthier (mentally and physically), being unmarried, being more educated, and working in an urban area. It is not surprising that perceived mental health would be closely related to job satisfaction. The marital status of a sample of Italian health workers had no significant influence on job satisfaction ( Bellani et al., 1996 ). However, the sample for the Italian study was about one third male in comparison with this African study which was 87.8% female. Married female nurses in Africa may have more stress than their male counterparts because of additional responsibilities related to home and child care, and this may lead to lower job satisfaction. The higher job satisfaction of the urban nurses provided documentation of one reason why nurse vacancy rates are so much higher in rural areas in many parts of Africa. There is growing support for the argument that HIV-related stigma reduction interventions can be effective ( Mahendra et al., 2007 ; Murphy et al., 2000 ; Pisal et al., 2007 ). These findings suggest that HIV stigma reduction interventions among nurses and their communities as a whole might have an unintended consequence of improving job satisfaction. The finding from this study demonstrates consistently low levels of job satisfaction across these five African countries and that this level of job satisfaction, while related to variables commonly reported in the literature, is also related to perceived HIV stigma. This finding provides new information that might guide interventions designed to improve nurse job satisfaction in Africa by directly addressing the concept of stigma by association with the nurses. Clinical Considerations Countries that are substantially affected by the HIV pandemic must consider health care worker job satisfaction as an important factor in ensuring care for people living with HIV. Nurses’ perception of stigma related to HIV significantly influences their job satisfaction. Health care center directors should consider interventions to reduce HIV-related stigma, which may also result in improved job satisfaction and retention for nurses.
