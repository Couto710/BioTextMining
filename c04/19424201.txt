IL-17A is not expressed by CD207+ cells in Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis lesions Interleukin-17 (IL-17A) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has recently been implicated in pathogenesis of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH), a potentially fatal disease characterized by lesions including CD207+ (langerin +) histiocytes. However, in this study we were unable to identify IL-17A gene expression in Langerhans cell lesions, and plasma levels of IL-17A did not correlate with disease activity. Therefore, this study does not support a central role for IL-17A in LCH pathogenesis.
