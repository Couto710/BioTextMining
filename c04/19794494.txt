Membrane-bound but not Secreted Fas Ligand Is Essential for Fas-Induced Apoptosis and Prevention of Autoimmunity and Cancer Fas ligand (FasL), an apoptosis-inducing member of the TNF cytokine family and its receptor, Fas, are critical for shutdown of chronic immune responses 1 - 3 and prevention of autoimmunity 4 , 5 . Accordingly, mutations in their genes cause severe lymphadenopathy and autoimmune disease in mice 6 , 7 and humans 8 , 9 . FasL function is regulated by deposition in the plasma membrane and metalloprotease-mediated shedding 10 , 11 . We generated gene-targeted mice that selectively lack either secreted FasL (?sFasL) or membrane-bound FasL (?mFasL) to resolve which of these forms is required for cell killing and to explore their hypothetical non-apoptotic activities. Mice lacking sFasL ( FasL ?s/?s ) appeared normal and their T cells readily killed target cells, whereas T cells lacking mFasL ( FasL ?m/?m ) could not kill cells through Fas activation. FasL ?m/?m mice developed lymphadenopathy and hyper-gammaglobulinaemia, similar to FasL gld/gld mice, which express a mutant form of FasL that cannot bind Fas, but surprisingly, (on a C57BL/6 background) FasL ?m/?m mice succumbed to SLE-like autoimmune kidney destruction and histiocytic sarcoma, diseases that occur only rarely and considerably later in FasL gld/gld mice. These results demonstrate that mFasL is essential for cytotoxic activity and constitutes the guardian against lymphadenopathy, autoimmunity and cancer whereas excess sFasL appears to promote autoimmunity and tumorigenesis through non-apoptotic activities.
