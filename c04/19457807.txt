Imaging Localized Prostate Cancer: Current Approaches and New Developments OBJECTIVE Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous malignancy among men in the Western world. Imaging has recently become more important in the diagnosis, local staging, and treatment follow-up of prostate cancer. In this article, we review conventional and functional imaging methods as well as targeted imaging approaches with novel tracers used in the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer. CONCLUSION Although prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, imaging of localized prostate cancer remains limited. Recent developments in imaging technologies, particularly MRI and PET, may lead to significant improvements in lesion detection and staging.  Conclusion Despite the importance of prostate cancer as the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men, the imaging of localized prostate cancer remains limited. This has held back attempts to develop focal therapy for prostate cancer that would preserve the majority of the gland, hopefully reducing the side effects of treatment. Most recent developments in imaging technologies, specifically in MRI, and the emergence of targeted imaging approaches with novel PET and gamma-emitting tracers could lead to significant improvements in both lesion detection and staging. Future development of new imaging methods that interrogate the biologic function of tumors may aid risk assessment and therapy choices. It is hoped that in the future imaging can be used to guide prostate-sparing treatment of localized prostate cancer.
