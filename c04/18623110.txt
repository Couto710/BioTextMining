Aberrant Crypt Foci as Precursors in Colorectal Cancer Progression Colorectal cancer progression originates when accumulated genetic and epigenetic alterations cause genomic instability and a malignant phenotype. Subsequent molecular pathway deregulation leads to histopathologic changes that are clinically evident as aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and visualized by high-magnification chromoscopic colonoscopy. ACF are biomarkers of increased colorectal cancer risk, particularly those with dysplastic features. Genetic profiling using genomic instability, loss of heterozygosity, and methylation analysis has revealed a minority population of ACF genotypically analogous to cancer.
