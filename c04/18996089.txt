TNF? is required for cholestasis-induced liver fibrosis in the mouse TNF?, a mediator of hepatotoxicity in several animal models, is elevated in acute and chronic liver diseases. Therefore, we investigated whether hepatic injury and fibrosis due to bile duct ligation (BDL) would be reduced in TNF? knockout mice (TNF??/?). Survival after BDL was 60% in wild-type mice (TNF?+/+) and 90% in TNF??/? mice. Body weight loss and liver to body weight ratios were reduced in TNF??/? mice compared to TNF?+/+ mice. Following BDL, serum alanine transaminases (ALT) levels were elevated in TNF?+/+ mice (268.6 ± 28.2 U/L) compared to TNF??/? mice (105.9 U/L ± 24.4). TNF? ?/? mice revealed lower hepatic collagen expression and less liver fibrosis in the histology. Further, ?-smooth muscle actin, an indicator for activated myofibroblasts, and TGF-? mRNA, a profibrogenic cytokine, were markedly reduced in TNF??/? mice compared to TNF?+/+ mice. Thus, our data indicate that TNF? induces hepatotoxicity and promotes fibrogenesis in the BDL model.  Materials and methods Animals A breeding colony of TNF??/? mice, a kind gift of breeding pairs from Michael W. Marino Sloan-Kettering, New York [ 23 ] and TNF?+/+ mice (C57Bl/6) was established at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. All animals were housed in a facility approved by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and received humane care in compliance with institutional guidelines. Animals were maintained under standard conditions. Operative procedure and experimental protocol TNF??/? and TNF?+/+ mice were allocated randomly to four experimental groups and either bile duct ligation (BDL) or sham operations were performed as described previously [ 24 ]. On the day of sacrifice, mice were anesthetized, livers were harvested and blood samples were collected. Clinical chemistry Serum was stored at ?20 °C until alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was analyzed by a standard quantitative colorimetric assay, according to the manufacturers’ protocol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Liver histology and histochemical detection of collagen Liver sections were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin; 10 ?m sections were mounted on glass slides. Sections were deparaffinized and the slides were incubated for 30 min in a solution of saturated picric acid containing 0.1% Sirius red and 0.1% fast green [ 24 ]. Image analysis was performed to quantify sirius red positive areas, as described [ 25 ]. Immunohistochemical staining for ?-smooth muscle actin Ten micron sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and placed in phosphate buffered saline with 1% Tween 20. Immunohistochemistry was performed with a monoclonal primary mouse anti-?-smooth muscle actin antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and the EnVision kit (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). The primary antibody was diluted 1:200 with 1% bovine albumin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in PBS. The procedure followed the instructions outlined by the manufacturer. ?-Smooth muscle actin positive cells were counted in 10 non-overlapping high power fields (hpf; magnification 400×). RNase protection assay Total RNA was isolated from liver tissue using RNA STAT 60 (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). RNase protection assays were performed using the Ribo Quant multiprobe assay system (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) as described previously [ 25 ]. Western blot Protein extraction and Western blotting were performed as described [ 26 ]. After electrophoresis the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and stained with 0.5% Ponceau S to assess equal protein loading and transfer. Membranes were incubated with anti-collagen type I antibody (1:1000, Rockland, PA, USA) or anti-?-tubulin (1:1000, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), followed by incubation with the corresponding secondary antibodies. Immunodetected proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescent ECL assay kit ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Gelatin zymography Twenty micrograms of whole liver cell extract were subjected to SDS–PAGE using a 0.1% gelatin containing polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After electrophoresis the gel was exposed to renaturing buffer (2,5% Triton X-100) for 1 h, followed by developing buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5 containing 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3) for 24 h. Gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie brilliant blue and destained with a solution of 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid. MMP activity was determined by densitometric scanning of the 62 and 68 kD proteolytic bands, corresponding to MMP activity. Statistical analysis Analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Tukey’s post-hoc tests were used for the determination of statistical significance, if appropriate. The Mann–Whitney rank sum test was used for statistical analysis of survival. P < 0.05 was selected as the level of significance. Data are expressed as means ± SEM.

Results Body weight, liver to body weight ratios, survival and serum chemistry Sham operation resulted in a body weight loss of about 10% in mice of both groups ( Fig. 1A ). BDL caused a decrease in body weight in wild-type mice by about 20% in week one and 30% in week three. In contrast, body weight loss was blunted in TNF??/? mice. However, there was only a statistical trend which did not reach the level of significance. Liver to body weight ratios were 3.9% and 4.0% in control mice ( Fig. 1B ). BDL caused a liver enlargement to 6.9% in TNF?+/+ mice and 6.0% in TNF??/? mice ( P = 0.017). Survival was 100% in both groups of sham-operated mice whereas only 60% of wild-type mice survived the experimental period of 3 weeks. In contrast, 90% of TNF??/? mice survived the experimental period ( Fig. 1C ). The average ALT levels of wild-type and TNF??/? mice were 54.9 ± 26.1 U/L and 70.1 ± 30.8 U/L after sham operation ( Fig. 1D ). BDL significantly increased serum ALT levels to 268.6 ± 28.2 U/L in TNF?+/+ mice but only 105.9 ± 24.4 U/L in TNF??/? mice ( P < 0.004). Histological and immunohistochemical evaluation of fibrosis Sirius red fast green staining and image analysis were performed to detect extracellular matrix proteins (ECM). No staining was observed in livers of sham-operated mice ( Fig. 2A , panel I: 0.8 ± 0.3% sirius red positive area; panel III: 1.0 ± 0.2% sirius red positive area). In contrast, strong staining was found in bile duct ligated wild-type mice compared to control mice ( Fig. 2A , panel II: 4.1 ± 0.5% sirius red positive area; P < 0.001). Fibrosis with bridging was predominantly present in periportal areas. In addition, necrotic foci were detected in bile duct ligated wild-type mice (data not shown). However, BDL did not cause significant fibrotic or necrotic changes in the livers of TNF??/? mice ( Fig. 2A , panel IV: 1.5 ± 0.3% sirius red positive area; P < 0.001). ?-Smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) is marker for activated HSC. ?-SMA positive cells could not be detected in livers of sham operated mice ( Fig. 2B , panel I; III), while ?-SMA positive cells were identified in wild-type mice after BDL, mainly in necrotic foci and around portal areas ( Fig. 2B , panel II: 47.7 ± 16.9 cells/hpf; P < 0.001). In contrast, positive staining was decreased in TNF??/? mice after BDL ( Fig. 2B , panel IV: 11.5 ± 6.2 cells/hpf; P < 0.001). Evaluation of collagen expression Collagen I protein expression was evaluated by Western blotting ( Fig. 2C ). In sham operated animals collagen I was not detectable. BDL resulted in a strong increase in the expression of collagen I in TNF?+/+ mice, while collagen I protein was not detectable in TNF??/? mice. ?-Tubulin served as a control to ensure equal loading ( Fig. 2C , lower panel). TGF-? mRNA expression and MMP activity TGF-? mRNA levels were analyzed by RNase protection assay. TGF-? mRNA was undetectable in livers of sham operated mice. BDL significantly increased TGF-? mRNA levels in both wild-type and TNF??/? mice but the increase was less in TNF??/? mice, indicating a decrease in the profibrogenic response in TNF??/? mice after BDL ( Fig. 2D ). To determine the activity of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP-2, ?9), gelatin zymography was performed ( Fig. 2E ). MMP activity was absent in mice after sham operation. MMP activity was clearly increased in TNF?+/+ and TNF??/? mice after BDL, revealing a band at 68 kDa corresponding to MMP-2. No differences in MMP activity were found between both BDL groups.

Discussion TNF? has many functions in hepatic injury. On the one hand, it plays an important role in liver regeneration [ 18 ], but it is also associated with liver injury in many experimental models [ 27 ] and human diseases [ 6 , 8 , 9 ]. Since experimental models showed that TNF? receptor knockout mice were protected from pulmonary fibrosis and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury [ 21 , 22 , 28 ] we wanted to test if liver injury and fibrosis caused by experimental cholestasis are attenuated in TNF??/? mice. Indeed, we found that fibrosis and liver injury were reduced significantly in TNF??/? mice following BDL-induced liver injury. We chose the BDL model, because TNF? is elevated in the serum of jaundiced mice and concentrations of the soluble TNF receptor negatively correlate with mortality in this model [ 19 , 29 ]. In line with these data, our study showed a clear decrease of survival rates in TNF?+/+ mice, while survival was 90% in TNF??/? mice, indicating a significant role of TNF? in the pathophysiological process in the BDL model. Moreover, body weight loss was less pronounced in absence of TNF?, confirming the cachectic effect of TNF? in the BDL model, previously attributed to TNF? as cachectin [ 30 , 31 ]. How does absence of TNF? protect the liver from hepatic injury and fibrosis due to BDL? Obstructive jaundice produces high levels of TNF? in macrophage-rich organs and peritoneal macrophages in response to LPS [ 32 ]. Hepatic macrophages, i. e. Kupffer cells (KC), largely contribute to liver fibrosis, since depletion of KC using GdCl3 prevents HSC activation and the development of cirrhosis in the rat [ 33 ]. BDL also leads to accumulation of hydrophobic bile acids which cause oxidative stress in the liver [ 34 , 35 ]. Oxidative stress can induce TGF-? in several cell types [ 36 , 37 ]. In the BDL model oxidative stress can increase TNF? and IL-6 concentrations via NF?B activation in KC leading to enhanced TGF? and collagen expression [ 20 , 38 ]. Conclusively, we showed decreased fibrosis and less hepatic collagen expression in mice lacking TNF?, while wild-type mice showed strong fibrotic changes after BDL. Since TNF? is able to induce profibrogenic signals in KC, a possible mechanism could be that the absence of TNF? leads to a reduction of cytokines, such as TGF?, from KC [ 20 , 38 ]. TGF? is one of the main profibrogenic factors involved in collagen synthesis and widely used to analyze the fibrogenic response [ 39 ]. Here, we demonstrate that TGF? mRNA levels were significantly diminished in TNF??/? mice after BDL, previously described in carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis [ 22 , 28 ]. Since TGF? is upregulated in liver fibrosis and known to cause HSC proliferation and production of collagen [ 40 , 41 ], TNF? leads to upregulation of TGF? in the BDL model thereby amplifying fibrosis. Hepatocytes contribute to the profibrogenic response, because signals from hepatocytes undergoing oxidative stress can increase proliferation and collagen synthesis in HSC [ 42 ]. TNF? has cytotoxic effects so that an effect of TNF? on hepatocytes cannot be ruled out [ 43 ]. Massive hepatocyte cell death and necrosis, followed by macrophage activation, subsequently leads to excessive repair and fibrosis, induced by stimuli from different hepatic cell-types [ 4 ]. Indeed, BDL significantly increased ALT values in serum of TNF?+/+ mice indicating parenchymal liver cell damage, while ALT release in TNF??/? mice was attenuated after BDL. We conclude that the absence of TNF? results in decreased parenchymal cell damage and attenuation of liver fibrosis. TNF? has direct effects on HSC. For example, TNF? can induce transcription factors only in activated, but not in quiescent HSC [ 15 ]. Moreover, TNF? activates HSC by stimulating MAP-kinase activity and increased AP-1 binding [ 44 , 45 ]. In the current study, HSC activation, shown by expression of ?-SMA, was clearly decreased in TNF??/? mice after BDL. Data supporting this showed that inhibition of TNF?-induced MAP kinase activation also reduced ?-SMA expression in HSC [ 44 ]. Thus, TNF? influences HSC activation in the BDL model. Since TGF? and TNF? can upregulate TIMP expression, thereby enhancing liver fibrosis [ 46 ], we analyzed collagenase activity by gelantin zymography. However, no differences in MMP activity were found in the BDL groups, indicating that TNF? does not interfere with collagenase activity in this model.  Discussion TNF? has many functions in hepatic injury. On the one hand, it plays an important role in liver regeneration [ 18 ], but it is also associated with liver injury in many experimental models [ 27 ] and human diseases [ 6 , 8 , 9 ].

In the current study, HSC activation, shown by expression of ?-SMA, was clearly decreased in TNF??/? mice after BDL. Data supporting this showed that inhibition of TNF?-induced MAP kinase activation also reduced ?-SMA expression in HSC [ 44 ]. Thus, TNF? influences HSC activation in the BDL model. Since TGF? and TNF? can upregulate TIMP expression, thereby enhancing liver fibrosis [ 46 ], we analyzed collagenase activity by gelantin zymography. However, no differences in MMP activity were found in the BDL groups, indicating that TNF? does not interfere with collagenase activity in this model.
