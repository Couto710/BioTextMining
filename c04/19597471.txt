Lysyl Oxidase Pro-peptide Inhibits Prostate Cancer Cell Growth by Mechanisms that Target FGF-2-Cell Binding and Signaling Enhanced RAS signaling and decreased androgen dependence of prostate cancer cells accompany poor clinical outcomes. Elevated autocrine FGF-2 signaling promotes prostate cancer cell growth and survival. Expression of lysyl oxidase ( LOX ) inhibits RAS transforming activity. LOX is secreted as 50 kDa pro-lysyl oxidase protein and then undergoes extracellular proteolytic processing to form ~30 kDa lysyl oxidase enzyme and ~18 kDa pro-peptide (LOX-PP). We have previously shown that LOX-PP inhibits breast cancer cell transformation and tumor formation, but mechanisms of action of LOX-PP have not been fully elucidated. Here we report that LOX expression is reduced in prostate cancer cell lines and that recombinant LOX-PP protein inhibits serum-stimulated DNA synthesis and MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways in DU 145 and PC-3 androgen-independent cell lines. In DU 145 cells, treatment with a pharmacologic FGF-receptor inhibitor or a neutralizing anti-FGFR1 antibody mimicked LOX-PP inhibition of serum-stimulated DNA synthesis. FGF-2-stimulated DNA synthesis, ERK1/2, AKT, and FRS2? activation were found all to be inhibited by LOX-PP in DU 145 cells. LOX-PP reduced specific binding of FGF-2 to DU 145 cells, suggesting that LOX-PP targets FGF signaling at the receptor. Interestingly, PC-3 cells did not respond to FGF-2, consistent with previous reports. We conclude that LOX-PP inhibits proliferation of DU 145 cells by interfering with FGFR(s) binding and signaling, and that LOX-PP has other mechanisms of action in PC-3 cells.  Introduction Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men ( Samid et al. , 1993 ). Prostate cancer initially requires androgen for growth and responds to hormone ablation strategies (castration and/or anti-androgen). Disease progresses to a state of reduced hormone dependence for which there is no effective treatment ( Weber and Gioeli, 2004 ). RAS signaling is activated in advanced prostate cancer ( Erlich et al. , 2006 ). Activation of mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases via RAS correlates positively with prostate cancer progression and drives androgen independence ( Gioeli et al. , 1999 ). A RAS antagonist, farnesylthiosalicylate, suppresses growth of prostate cancer in vivo ( McPherson et al. , 2004 ). Activation of RAS signaling is sufficient for progression of androgen dependent LNCaP and CWR22 cells towards androgen independence ( Weber and Gioeli, 2004 ). RAS signaling is highly active in androgen independent DU 145 and PC-3 cell lines ( Gioeli et al. , 1999 ) and overexpressed Her-2/neu plays a major role in growth by elevating RAS activity ( Kominsky et al. , 2000 ). Activating RAS mutations are rare in prostate cancer ( Erlich et al. , 2006 ), suggesting that RAS activation predominantly occurs through growth factor receptor activation ( Culig et al. , 1994 ; Planz et al. , 2001 ). Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) play an important role in growth and maintenance of normal prostate tissues ( Ropiquet et al. , 2000 ). FGFs are produced by stromal cells and contribute to paracrine stimulation of epithelial growth ( Giri et al. , 1999 ). In particular, FGF-2 has a major role in prostate epithelial cell proliferation ( Ropiquet et al. , 1999 ). FGF-2 antisense studies in prostate cancer cell lines show that FGF-2 is required for cell survival and proliferation ( Shain, 2004 ). Effects of FGFs are mediated by binding to high-affinity cell surface receptors ( Forsten-Williams et al. , 2005 ; Johnson and Williams, 1993 ; Natke et al. , 1999 ; Nugent and Edelman, 1992 ; Powers et al. , 2000 ). Binding of FGF-2 to its receptors (FGFR1-4) is enhanced by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans and leads to FGFRs autophosphorylation and activation ( Johnson and Williams, 1993 ; Nugent and Iozzo, 2000 ). Ultimately, activation of FGFRs leads to signal transduction through multiple pathways downstream of activated RAS including ERK MAP kinases, the AKT/phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and by Fibroblast Receptor Substrate-2? (FRS2?), an FGF pathway-specific mediator ( Eswarakumar et al. , 2005 ; Kwabi-Addo et al. , 2004 ; Mohammadi et al. , 1991 ; Schlessinger, 2004 ; Weber and Gioeli, 2004 ). Androgen independent DU 145 and PC-3 cell lines express higher amounts of FGFR1 compared to androgen independent LNCaP cells ( Nakamoto et al. , 1992 ). Unlike DU 145 cells, however, PC-3 cells are both unresponsive to exogenous FGF-2 and express higher levels of c-MYC ( Jones et al. , 1997 ; Nakamoto et al. , 1992 ). Lysyl oxidase (LOX) enzyme catalyzes the final enzymatic step required for collagen and elastin cross-linking ( Kagan and Li, 2003 ; Kagan and Trackman, 1991 ). LOX is synthesized as a 50 kDa glycosylated pro-enzyme (Pro-LOX), and then secreted where it undergoes extracellular proteolytic processing by procollagen C-proteinases to functional ~30 kDa enzyme and an ~18 kDa pro-peptide (LOX-PP) ( Kagan and Li, 2003 ; Trackman et al. , 1992 ; Uzel et al. , 2001 ). Generation of LOX enzyme and LOX-PP occurs as a consequence of extracellular post-translational biosynthetic proteolytic processing of secreted Pro-LOX ( Trackman et al. , 1992 ). Expression of the LOX gene was found to inhibit RAS transforming activity and was hence named the “ras recision” gene ( rrg ) ( Contente et al. , 1990 ; Kenyon et al. , 1991 ). Reduced LOX levels were observed in many cancers and cancer-derived cell lines ( Contente et al. , 1990 ; Hajnal et al. , 1993 ; Hamalainen et al. , 1995 ; Krzyzosiak et al. , 1992 ; Kuivaniemi et al. , 1986 ). Furthermore, LOX expression is reduced in primary and metastatic prostate cancers ( Ren et al. , 1998 ). We have reported that LOX-PP, and not LOX enzyme, inhibits RAS-dependent transformation of NIH 3T3 cells ( Jeay et al. , 2003 ; Palamakumbura et al. , 2004 ). LOX-PP is a potent inhibitor of the transformed phenotype of breast cancer cells ( Min et al. , 2007 ). Moreover, LOX-PP expression attenuates growth of breast cancer cells implanted into mice ( Min et al. , 2007 ). By contrast, active LOX enzyme promotes invasion by some tumor cells ( Kirschmann et al. , 2002 ; Payne et al. , 2005 ) suggesting that LOX-PP may function to control negative effects of LOX enzyme with respect to cancer development. We report here that LOX-PP inhibits growth responses to serum and to FGF-2 of androgen independent DU 145 prostate cancer cells. A mechanism of action of LOX-PP is shown here for the first time: LOX-PP inhibits FGF-2 binding to DU 145 cells, thereby interrupting autocrine and/or paracrine pathways. Data obtained with PC-3 cells indicates that LOX-PP similarly inhibits serum-stimulated growth responses, but by mechanisms that differ from those in DU 145 cells.  Results Prostate cancer cells express lower levels of LOX than normal prostate cells We evaluated LOX expression levels in six different human prostate cancer cell lines and in a control prostate epithelial cell line (PWR-1E). Cells were grown ( Bonaccorsi et al. , 2004 ), total RNA isolated, and LOX expression determined by qPCR. All cancer cell lines express less than 10% of LOX mRNA levels compared to PWR-1E prostate epithelial cells ( Figure 1A ). To evaluate relative LOX protein expression, conditioned media samples were subjected to Western blotting. High levels of ~50 kDa pro-LOX protein ( Trackman et al. , 1992 ) were detected in conditioned medium from PWR-1E cells ( Figure 1B ). In addition, ~18 kDa and ~35kDa protein bands were observed in media from PWR-1E cells ( Figure 1B ) that correspond, respectively, to glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of LOX-PP previously seen in conditioned media samples ( Guo et al. , 2007 ). No LOX-PP immunoreactive bands were seen in conditioned media samples from any of the six prostate cancer cell lines tested, consistent with findings at the RNA level seen in Figure 1A . rLOX-PP inhibits growth of prostate cancer cells We next evaluated the ability of rLOX-PP to inhibit serum-stimulated DNA synthesis of DU 145 and PC-3 cells. rLOX-PP inhibits serum-stimulated thymidine incorporation in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner compared to controls ( Figure 2 ). Effects of rLOX-PP on cell cycle regulatory proteins expression was next measured. Serum-stimulated cyclin D1, CDK4, CDK6 and PCNA expression were all decreased by rLOX-PP in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3 ). That rLOX-PP inhibits serum-stimulated expression of these proteins further supports the notion that rLOX-PP interferes with proliferative responses in prostate cancer cells. rLOX-PP inhibits ERK1/2 and AKT signaling Both DU 145 and PC-3 cells are androgen independent and express high amounts RAS protein. As an index of RAS activity, we determined levels of serum-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK and AKT in the presence and absence of LOX-PP. Data in Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate that serum-stimulated ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation is inhibited by rLOX-PP in a dose-dependent manner. These data support the notion that rLOX-PP inhibits growth factor-mediated signaling pathways in these cells. Serum-induced proliferation of prostate cancer cells and FGF-2 signaling In prostate cancer, wild type RAS is activated by autocrine and paracrine growth factor regulation ( Weber and Gioeli, 2004 ) often by FGF-2 dependent pathways ( Gioeli, 2005 ; Giri et al. , 2001 ; Ozen et al. , 2001 ). We, therefore, investigated effects of FGF-2 on DNA synthesis of DU 145 and PC-3 cells. FGF-2 increases the DNA synthesis of DU 145 cells and is dose-dependent ( Figure 6A ). However, PC-3 cells did not significantly respond to exogenous FGF-2, consistent with previous reports ( Jones et al. , 1997 ; Nakamoto et al. , 1992 ) (data not shown). Hence DU 145 cells were employed to further investigate effects of rLOX-PP on FGF-2-stimulated DNA synthesis. We next investigated whether LOX-PP inhibits serum-stimulated proliferation by interfering with FGF-2-dependent signaling in DU 145 cells. PD173074 is an ATP competitive reversible inhibitor of FGFR kinase that attenuates FGFR1-mediated signaling. DU 145 cells cultured in media containing 0.1% FBS were treated with 0 - 200 nM PD173074 for 18 hours. These concentrations of PD173074 are known to specifically inhibit FGF-2 induced proliferation ( Bansal et al. , 2003 ). Cells were then stimulated with 10% serum for 6 hours and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined. As shown in Figure 6B , 100 nM and 200 nM PD173074 inhibit serum-induced DNA synthesis of DU 145 cells, and inhibition is dose-dependent. To confirm that serum-induced proliferation of DU 145 cells depends mostly upon FGF receptor mediated signaling, neutralizing anti-FGFR1 monoclonal antibody (clone VBS1) was used to block FGFR1 activity. This antibody inhibits FGF-2 induced DNA synthesis in coronary venular endothelial cells by blocking FGF-2 binding to its receptor ( Blanckaert et al. , 2002 ). DU 145 cells cultured in 0.1% serum were treated with 0 or 10 ?g/ml anti-FGFR1 antibody or control IgG for 18 hours. Cells were then stimulated with 10% serum for 6 hours and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined. Anti-FGFR1 antibody inhibits serum-induced DNA synthesis ( Figure 6C ). Blocking of the anti-FGFR antibody by pre-treatment with rFGFR1 diminished its ability to inhibit serum-induced DNA synthesis, confirming the specificity of the anti-FGFR antibody employed ( Figure 6C ). Separate experiments show that neutralizing FGFR1 antibody fully blocks FGF-2-stimulated DNA synthesis in DU 145 cells, as expected ( Figure S1 ). rLOX-PP inhibits FGF-2 stimulation of DNA synthesis in DU 145 cells Effects of rLOX-PP on FGF-2-dependent DNA synthesis of DU 145 cells were investigated. Cells grown in serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA for 24 hours were treated with increasing concentrations of rLOX-PP, and cells were then treated with FGF-2 followed by addition of [3H]thymidine in the absence or continuous presence of rLOX-PP for 6 hours. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was then determined. rLOX-PP inhibits FGF-2-stimulated DNA synthesis of DU 145 cells in a dose-dependent manner to levels near non-stimulated control cells ( Figure 7 ). Taken together, results suggest that rLOX-PP inhibits FGF-2 induced proliferative responses in DU 145 cells. rLOX-PP inhibits FGF-2 induced signaling We next asked whether rLOX-PP can interfere with FGF-2 induced activation of ERK1/2 and AKT. Cells in serum-free media containing 0.1% BSA were treated with rLOX-PP (0 or 10 ?g/ml), and then stimulated with 0 or 10 ng/ml FGF-2 for 5 or 15 minutes. Cell layer proteins were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 8 , rLOX-PP strongly inhibits FGF-2 induced ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation. To further confirm that rLOX-PP interferes with FGF-2 induced signaling, effects of rLOX-PP on activating phosphorylations of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Substrate-2? (FRS2?) were determined. FRS2? is an FGF pathway-specific signaling intermediate ( Eswarakumar et al. , 2005 ). DU 145 cells grown in serum-free media containing 0.1% BSA were treated with rLOX-PP (0 or 10 ?g/ml) followed by 0 or 10 ng/ml FGF-2 for 2 minutes, when FRS2? phosphorylation is maximum. Cell layer proteins were then harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 9 , rLOX-PP potently inhibits FGF-2 induced FRS2? phosphorylation. rLOX-PP inhibits binding of FGF-2 to DU 145 cells Binding of FGF-2 to heparan sulfate proteoglycans facilitates its binding to receptors ( Chu et al. , 2004 ; Chua et al. , 2004 ). LOX-PP is rich in arginine and is cationic with a calculated pI of 12.5. Due to its highly basic nature, LOX-PP could potentially interfere with FGF-2 binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans and/or to FGFRs, and thereby inhibit FGF-2 dependent signaling. Hence, the specific saturation binding curve of FGF-2 to DU 145 cells was determined by competitive binding assays under equilibrium conditions. Cells cultured in medium containing 0.1% BSA for 24 hours were treated with 125I-FGF-2 (0 - 600 pM) for 2 hours at 4°C. Bound 125I-FGF-2 was extracted and quantified using a gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of excess non labeled FGF-2 (230 nM). FGF-2 binding to DU 145 cells reached saturation at concentrations of 350 pM of total FGF-2 (data not shown), a biologically active concentration that corresponds to 6 ng/ml FGF-2 as seen in Figure 7 . This concentration of FGF-2 was then used to determine whether rLOX-PP can inhibit FGF-2 binding to DU 145 cells. Cells were treated with 125I-FGF-2 and rLOX-PP (0 - 10 ?g/ml) for 15 minutes, and FGF-2 binding was determined. Data in Figure 10 demonstrates that rLOX-PP inhibits specific binding of FGF-2 in a dose-dependent manner. An IC50 of 6.8 ?g/ml was obtained from the same data. This value is consistent with concentrations of LOX-PP required for inhibition of serum- and FGF-2-stimulated activities. Taken together, data show that rLOX-PP inhibition of FGF-2 induced signaling and biological activity in DU 145 cells occurs at the level of inhibition of FGF-2 cell binding in DU 145 cells.

As shown in Figure 6B , 100 nM and 200 nM PD173074 inhibit serum-induced DNA synthesis of DU 145 cells, and inhibition is dose-dependent. To confirm that serum-induced proliferation of DU 145 cells depends mostly upon FGF receptor mediated signaling, neutralizing anti-FGFR1 monoclonal antibody (clone VBS1) was used to block FGFR1 activity. This antibody inhibits FGF-2 induced DNA synthesis in coronary venular endothelial cells by blocking FGF-2 binding to its receptor ( Blanckaert et al. , 2002 ). DU 145 cells cultured in 0.1% serum were treated with 0 or 10 ?g/ml anti-FGFR1 antibody or control IgG for 18 hours. Cells were then stimulated with 10% serum for 6 hours and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined. Anti-FGFR1 antibody inhibits serum-induced DNA synthesis ( Figure 6C ). Blocking of the anti-FGFR antibody by pre-treatment with rFGFR1 diminished its ability to inhibit serum-induced DNA synthesis, confirming the specificity of the anti-FGFR antibody employed ( Figure 6C ). Separate experiments show that neutralizing FGFR1 antibody fully blocks FGF-2-stimulated DNA synthesis in DU 145 cells, as expected ( Figure S1 ).  Serum-induced proliferation of prostate cancer cells and FGF-2 signaling In prostate cancer, wild type RAS is activated by autocrine and paracrine growth factor regulation ( Weber and Gioeli, 2004 ) often by FGF-2 dependent pathways ( Gioeli, 2005 ; Giri et al. , 2001 ; Ozen et al. , 2001 ). We, therefore, investigated effects of FGF-2 on DNA synthesis of DU 145 and PC-3 cells. FGF-2 increases the DNA synthesis of DU 145 cells and is dose-dependent ( Figure 6A ). However, PC-3 cells did not significantly respond to exogenous FGF-2, consistent with previous reports ( Jones et al. , 1997 ; Nakamoto et al. , 1992 ) (data not shown). Hence DU 145 cells were employed to further investigate effects of rLOX-PP on FGF-2-stimulated DNA synthesis. We next investigated whether LOX-PP inhibits serum-stimulated proliferation by interfering with FGF-2-dependent signaling in DU 145 cells. PD173074 is an ATP competitive reversible inhibitor of FGFR kinase that attenuates FGFR1-mediated signaling. DU 145 cells cultured in media containing 0.1% FBS were treated with 0 - 200 nM PD173074 for 18 hours. These concentrations of PD173074 are known to specifically inhibit FGF-2 induced proliferation ( Bansal et al. , 2003 ). Cells were then stimulated with 10% serum for 6 hours and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined. As shown in Figure 6B , 100 nM and 200 nM PD173074 inhibit serum-induced DNA synthesis of DU 145 cells, and inhibition is dose-dependent. To confirm that serum-induced proliferation of DU 145 cells depends mostly upon FGF receptor mediated signaling, neutralizing anti-FGFR1 monoclonal antibody (clone VBS1) was used to block FGFR1 activity. This antibody inhibits FGF-2 induced DNA synthesis in coronary venular endothelial cells by blocking FGF-2 binding to its receptor ( Blanckaert et al. , 2002 ). DU 145 cells cultured in 0.1% serum were treated with 0 or 10 ?g/ml anti-FGFR1 antibody or control IgG for 18 hours. Cells were then stimulated with 10% serum for 6 hours and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined. Anti-FGFR1 antibody inhibits serum-induced DNA synthesis ( Figure 6C ). Blocking of the anti-FGFR antibody by pre-treatment with rFGFR1 diminished its ability to inhibit serum-induced DNA synthesis, confirming the specificity of the anti-FGFR antibody employed ( Figure 6C ). Separate experiments show that neutralizing FGFR1 antibody fully blocks FGF-2-stimulated DNA synthesis in DU 145 cells, as expected ( Figure S1 ).  rLOX-PP inhibits FGF-2 stimulation of DNA synthesis in DU 145 cells Effects of rLOX-PP on FGF-2-dependent DNA synthesis of DU 145 cells were investigated. Cells grown in serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA for 24 hours were treated with increasing concentrations of rLOX-PP, and cells were then treated with FGF-2 followed by addition of [3H]thymidine in the absence or continuous presence of rLOX-PP for 6 hours. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was then determined. rLOX-PP inhibits FGF-2-stimulated DNA synthesis of DU 145 cells in a dose-dependent manner to levels near non-stimulated control cells ( Figure 7 ). Taken together, results suggest that rLOX-PP inhibits FGF-2 induced proliferative responses in DU 145 cells.  rLOX-PP inhibits FGF-2 stimulation of DNA synthesis in DU 145 cells Effects of rLOX-PP on FGF-2-dependent DNA synthesis of DU 145 cells were investigated. Cells grown in serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA for 24 hours were treated with increasing concentrations of rLOX-PP, and cells were then treated with FGF-2 followed by addition of [3H]thymidine in the absence or continuous presence of rLOX-PP for 6 hours. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was then determined. rLOX-PP inhibits FGF-2-stimulated DNA synthesis of DU 145 cells in a dose-dependent manner to levels near non-stimulated control cells ( Figure 7 ). Taken together, results suggest that rLOX-PP inhibits FGF-2 induced proliferative responses in DU 145 cells.  rLOX-PP inhibits FGF-2 induced signaling We next asked whether rLOX-PP can interfere with FGF-2 induced activation of ERK1/2 and AKT. Cells in serum-free media containing 0.1% BSA were treated with rLOX-PP (0 or 10 ?g/ml), and then stimulated with 0 or 10 ng/ml FGF-2 for 5 or 15 minutes. Cell layer proteins were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 8 , rLOX-PP strongly inhibits FGF-2 induced ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation. To further confirm that rLOX-PP interferes with FGF-2 induced signaling, effects of rLOX-PP on activating phosphorylations of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Substrate-2? (FRS2?) were determined. FRS2? is an FGF pathway-specific signaling intermediate ( Eswarakumar et al. , 2005 ). DU 145 cells grown in serum-free media containing 0.1% BSA were treated with rLOX-PP (0 or 10 ?g/ml) followed by 0 or 10 ng/ml FGF-2 for 2 minutes, when FRS2? phosphorylation is maximum. Cell layer proteins were then harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 9 , rLOX-PP potently inhibits FGF-2 induced FRS2? phosphorylation.  rLOX-PP inhibits FGF-2 induced signaling We next asked whether rLOX-PP can interfere with FGF-2 induced activation of ERK1/2 and AKT. Cells in serum-free media containing 0.1% BSA were treated with rLOX-PP (0 or 10 ?g/ml), and then stimulated with 0 or 10 ng/ml FGF-2 for 5 or 15 minutes. Cell layer proteins were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 8 , rLOX-PP strongly inhibits FGF-2 induced ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation. To further confirm that rLOX-PP interferes with FGF-2 induced signaling, effects of rLOX-PP on activating phosphorylations of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Substrate-2? (FRS2?) were determined. FRS2? is an FGF pathway-specific signaling intermediate ( Eswarakumar et al. , 2005 ). DU 145 cells grown in serum-free media containing 0.1% BSA were treated with rLOX-PP (0 or 10 ?g/ml) followed by 0 or 10 ng/ml FGF-2 for 2 minutes, when FRS2? phosphorylation is maximum. Cell layer proteins were then harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 9 , rLOX-PP potently inhibits FGF-2 induced FRS2? phosphorylation.  rLOX-PP inhibits binding of FGF-2 to DU 145 cells Binding of FGF-2 to heparan sulfate proteoglycans facilitates its binding to receptors ( Chu et al. , 2004 ; Chua et al. , 2004 ). LOX-PP is rich in arginine and is cationic with a calculated pI of 12.5. Due to its highly basic nature, LOX-PP could potentially interfere with FGF-2 binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans and/or to FGFRs, and thereby inhibit FGF-2 dependent signaling. Hence, the specific saturation binding curve of FGF-2 to DU 145 cells was determined by competitive binding assays under equilibrium conditions. Cells cultured in medium containing 0.1% BSA for 24 hours were treated with 125I-FGF-2 (0 - 600 pM) for 2 hours at 4°C. Bound 125I-FGF-2 was extracted and quantified using a gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of excess non labeled FGF-2 (230 nM). FGF-2 binding to DU 145 cells reached saturation at concentrations of 350 pM of total FGF-2 (data not shown), a biologically active concentration that corresponds to 6 ng/ml FGF-2 as seen in Figure 7 . This concentration of FGF-2 was then used to determine whether rLOX-PP can inhibit FGF-2 binding to DU 145 cells. Cells were treated with 125I-FGF-2 and rLOX-PP (0 - 10 ?g/ml) for 15 minutes, and FGF-2 binding was determined. Data in Figure 10 demonstrates that rLOX-PP inhibits specific binding of FGF-2 in a dose-dependent manner. An IC50 of 6.8 ?g/ml was obtained from the same data. This value is consistent with concentrations of LOX-PP required for inhibition of serum- and FGF-2-stimulated activities. Taken together, data show that rLOX-PP inhibition of FGF-2 induced signaling and biological activity in DU 145 cells occurs at the level of inhibition of FGF-2 cell binding in DU 145 cells.  rLOX-PP inhibits binding of FGF-2 to DU 145 cells Binding of FGF-2 to heparan sulfate proteoglycans facilitates its binding to receptors ( Chu et al. , 2004 ; Chua et al. , 2004 ).

This value is consistent with concentrations of LOX-PP required for inhibition of serum- and FGF-2-stimulated activities. Taken together, data show that rLOX-PP inhibition of FGF-2 induced signaling and biological activity in DU 145 cells occurs at the level of inhibition of FGF-2 cell binding in DU 145 cells.  Discussion Prostate cancers typically begin as androgen sensitive lesions but develop into androgen insensitive lesions with progression to advanced stages ( Erlich et al. , 2006 ). Increases in autocrine and paracrine growth factor loops correlate with prostate cancer progression and with androgen independence ( Culig et al. , 1994 ; Weber and Gioeli, 2004 ). Increased expression of growth factors including FGF-2, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Transforming Growth Factor-?, (TGF-?), Keratonocyte Growth Factor (KGF), and Insulin Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) and increased expression of their respective cognate receptors are responsible for driving progression to androgen independence ( Culig et al. , 1994 ; Planz et al. , 2001 ). This understanding predicts that a variety of signaling events may drive the transformed phenotype of prostate cancer cells. Interactions between different signaling pathways are likely to change as prostate cancer progresses from androgen dependent to androgen independent. FGF-2, however, is expressed during all stages of human prostate cancer and plays a critical role in prostate cancer progression ( Giri et al. , 1999 ; Kwabi-Addo et al. , 2004 ). Hemi- or homozygous inactivation of FGF-2 alleles in mice with transgenic adenocarcinoma of the prostate (TRAMP) by crossing with FGF-2 null mice, have increased survival by inhibiting progression to a poorly differentiated tumor cell phenotype and to metastatic disease ( Polnaszek et al. , 2003 ). Higher levels of FGF-2 are expressed by androgen independent DU 145 and PC-3 cell lines compared to androgen dependent LNCaP cells ( Cronauer et al. , 1997 ). Hence, it has been suggested that FGF-2 is a major growth factor responsible for increased proliferation and metastasis in prostate cancer cells by paracrine and autocrine pathways. FGF-2 signaling is an attractive therapeutic target for cancer therapy. Suramin, a compound that can inhibit FGF signaling, was reported to enhance anti-tumor effect of doxorubicin on human prostate cancer ( Zhang et al. , 2001 ). Moreover, inhibition of export of FGF-2 by Anvirzel, a novel treatment for cancer, contributes to its anti-tumor activity ( Smith et al. , 2001 ). FGF-2 activation of MEK/ERK signaling plays a critical role in cancer cell migration ( Hatziapostolou et al. , 2006 ; Wesley et al. , 2005 ). In endothelial cells, FGF-2 increases activation of integrin ?v?3 to facilitate cell migration via the ERK pathway ( Kwabi-Addo et al. , 2004 ). Moreover, FGF-2 and PDGF synergistically promote tumor angiogenesis and pulmonary metastasis ( Nissen et al. , 2007 ). Thus, FGF-2/FGFR signaling can play an important role in invasion and migration of cancer cells. Several different approaches have been taken to inhibit FGFR mediated signaling, such as developing antibodies to target receptors ( He et al. , 2003 ) or using small molecule inhibitors that target the catalytic kinase domain ( Mohammadi et al. , 1997 ). Although LOX-PP reduces cancer cell transformation and inhibits RAS-dependent signaling pathways ( Jeay et al. , 2003 ; Min et al. , 2007 ; Palamakumbura et al. , 2004 ; Wu et al. , 2007 ), mechanisms by which this occurs have remained largely unknown. Here we show for the first time that LOX-PP inhibits FGF-2-induced signaling in DU 145 prostate cancer cells. Data further indicate that one mechanism by which LOX-PP inhibits cell proliferation is to interfere with binding of FGF-2 to its receptor(s) ( Figure 11 ). Findings obtained in PC-3 prostate cancer cells show that LOX-PP effectively inhibits proliferative responses to serum, but this inhibition occurs by a mechanism that appears not to include inhibition of FGF-2 signaling. LOX-PP has recently been shown to interfere with integrin-mediated haptotaxis and FAK activation that is driven by activated EGF-receptor ( HER2 ) initiated signaling in MDA-MB-231 (human) and NF639 (mouse) breast cancer cell lines ( Zhao et al. , 2009 ). Taken together, data support the notion that LOX-PP acts by more than one mechanism to inhibit growth responses of cancer cells. We suggest that the effectiveness of LOX-PP as a tumor suppressor is related to its ability to work by multiple mechanisms of action, rather than by only one mechanism. Data indicate that LOX expression is low in several prostate cancer cells compared to a normal prostate epithelial cell line ( Figure 1 ). We have previously shown that an FGF-2 autocrine pathway decreases expression of LOX in RAS -transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts ( Palamakumbura et al. , 2003 ). Thus, increased expression of FGF-2 in DU 145 cells could contribute to low expression of LOX itself, by these and perhaps other, cancer cell lines. It is notable that LOX levels were reported to be diminished in primary human prostate cancer tissues and that LOX expression decreases as a function of prostate cancer progression ( Ren et al. , 1998 ). Taken together with data presented here, we suggest that high levels of FGF-2 in prostate cancer tissues help to both down-regulate LOX expression, and therefore LOX-PP levels, and promote tumor cell proliferation ( Figure 11 ). There are some conflicting reports regarding whether LOX is a tumor suppressor or a tumor promoter. Increased expression of LOX under hypoxic conditions correlates with increased invasiveness of breast cancer tumors ( Erler et al. , 2009 ; Erler and Weaver, 2009 ). ?-Aminopropionitrile, a specific irreversible inhibitor for LOX enzyme activity, reduces breast cancer metastasis significantly in mice, suggesting that LOX enzyme, and not LOX-PP, is responsible for increased metastasis ( Erler et al. , 2006 ; Erler and Giaccia, 2006 ; Kirschmann et al. , 2002 ; Payne et al. , 2005 ). Based on Western blotting data alone, it has recently been suggested that Pro-LOX, and not LOX-PP, is a tumor suppressor ( Contente et al. , 2009 ). The present study, and previous work, show directly that LOX-PP is active as an inhibitor of prostate, breast, lung, and pancreatic tumor cell growth and RAS-dependent signaling ( Min et al. , 2007 ; Wu et al. , 2007 ). Moreover, LOX-PP expression inhibits breast cancer cell growth in xenografts in vivo ( Min et al. , 2007 ). LOX-PP itself, therefore, is clearly active as a tumor suppressor. Data do support that ectopic Pro-LOX expression (that contains the LOX-PP domain) inhibits signaling pathways that contribute to cell transformation ( Min et al. , 2007 ; Wu et al. , 2007 ). Processing of Pro-LOX to LOX-PP was, however, not inhibited in these reports, and it is not currently possible to definitively conclude which molecular form of LOX-PP is more active as a tumor suppressor. We suspect, however, that Pro-LOX that appears to be enzymatically inactive ( Trackman et al. , 1992 ) and free LOX-PP are both active tumor suppressors. This notion raises the possibility that regulation of extracellular proteolytic processing of Pro-LOX and turnover of LOX proteins may contribute to the respective balance between the tumor suppressor function of Pro-LOX and LOX-PP, and promotion of invasion by active LOX enzyme.

All growth media contained 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ?g/ml streptomycin. Cultures were incubated at 37°C in a fully humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cells in logarithmic growth phase were dissociated with trypsin/EDTA, and plated at a desired density. After cells became 75% confluent, they were serum starved for 24 hours and then treated as described in each experiment. RNA isolation and real time PCR Total RNA was isolated from PWR-1E, LNCaP, CWR22, 22RV1, DU 145 and PC-3 cell cultures grown in complete media, and purified using RNeasy mini-RNA purification kits (Qiagen).
