Prominin1 marks intestinal stem cells that are susceptible to neoplastic transformation Cancer stem cells (CSC) are remarkably similar to normal stem cells: both self-renew, are multipotent and express common surface markers, e.g., PROMININ-1 (PROM1, CD133) 1 . What remains unclear is whether CSC are the direct progeny of mutated stem cells, or more mature cells that reacquire stem cell properties during tumor formation. Answering this important question will require knowledge of whether normal stem cells are susceptible to cancer causing mutations; however, this has proved difficult to test since the identity of most adult tissue stem cells is not known. Here, using an inducible-Cre-nuclear(n)LacZ reporter allele knocked into the Prom1 locus ( Prom1 C-L ), we show that Prom1 is expressed in a variety of developing and adult tissues. Lineage-tracing studies of adult Prom1 +/ C-L mice containing the Rosa26YFP reporter allele showed that Prom1+ cells are located at the base of crypts in the small intestine, co-express Lgr5 2 , generate the entire intestinal epithelium, and are therefore likely to be the small intestinal stem cell. Prom1 was reported recently to mark CSC of human intestinal tumors that arise frequently as a consequence of aberrant Wingless (WNT) signaling 3 - 5 . Activation of endogenous Wnt signaling in Prom1 +/ C-L mice containing a Cre-dependent mutant allele of Beta-catenin ( Ctnnb1 lox(ex3) ) resulted first in a gross disruption of crypt architecture and a disproportionate expansion of Prom1+ cells at the crypt base. Lineage-tracing demonstrated that the progeny of these cells replaced the mucosa of the entire small intestine with neoplastic tissue that was characterized by focal high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and crypt adenoma formation. Although all neoplastic cells arose from Prom1+ cells in these mice, only 7% of tumor cells retained Prom1 expression. Our data indicate that Prom1 marks stem cells in the adult small intestine, which are susceptible to transformation into tumors retaining a fraction of mutant-Prom1+ tumor cells.  Methods Summary Mice Prom1 C-L mice were generated by homologous recombination in 129SvEv mouse embryonic stem cells targeting a CreERT2-IRES-nLacZ-PGK-Neo cassette to the ATG of Prom1 . PGK-Neo flanked by flip-recombinase target (FRT) sites was subsequently excised by flip-recombination by breeding with Rosa26-FLPe mice. Rosa26YFP reporter and Rosa26FLPe mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. Ctnnb1 lox(ex3)/lox(ex3) mice were kindly provided by Dr. Makoto 29 . Mice aged 2 months were treated by oral gavage with 250 ?l tamoxifen in corn oil at 40 mg/ml for two consecutive days. Histology and microscopy For nLacZ analysis, YFP microscopy and immunofluoresence, tissues were perfused and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight, cryo-protected and frozen in OCT. For immunohistochemistry, tissues were fixed in 4% PFA and paraffin embedded. In situ probes for Lgr5 and Prom1 were generated from cDNA clones and BC156649 and BC028286, respectively. Alcian blue and PAS staining were performed on frozen sections following standard protocols. See supplemental methods for details. Explants and two-photon microscopy Intestine from tamoxifen treated mice was removed surgically and immediately submerged in Kreb's solution and superfused with a gas mixture of 95% O2/CO2. One millimetre slices were placed on glass coverslips and stabilized with overlying mechanical support and maintained at 37°C within the microscope chamber. Two-photon laser-scanning microscopy was performed using an Ultima imaging system (Prairie Technologies, Middletown, WI), a Ti:sapphire Chameleon Ultra femtosecond-pulsed laser (910 nm) (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). Images were analyzed using Imaris software (Bitplane, Switzerland). 3-dimensional images were constructed from Z-series stacks taken in 1 ?m steps. Culture of intestinal crypt stem cells Intestinal epithelial cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 2mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml Penicillin, 100ug/ml Streptomicin and 2.5% FBS. YFP+ cells and colonies (formed after 4 weeks in culture) were visualized and counted using fluorescence microscopy. See supplemental methods for details.

Methods Generation of <italic>Prom1</italic><sup>+/<italic>C-L</italic></sup> mice The 8.0 kb 5? end of the mouse Prom1 gene (4.8 kb upstream of the ATG start codon and 3.2 kb downstream of ATG) was cloned into pBluescript KS+ plasmid by recombineering from the Ensembl 129S7-derived genomic BAC clone bMQ446F18. The ATG start codon was then replaced by the CreERT2-IRES-LacZ-PgkNeo cassette using the same recombineering-base cloning strategy. The Prom1-CreERT2-IRES-LacZ expression construct (25?g) was linearized and transfected into 129SvEv mouse embryonic stem cells (Millipore, CMTI-1). Neomycin-resistant recombinant ES clones were selected in medium containing 350 ?g/ml G418 for day 2-3 and 150 ?g/ml for day 4-7. 192 recombinant ES clones were picked into two 96-well plates and cultured to 70% confluence. Plates were then duplicated, one cryo-preserved and one continued cultured to 100% confluence for DNA isolation. DNA from all clones was screened for the correct targeting by long PCR (Platinum® Taq polymerase high fidelity, Invitogen, 11304-011) with primers flanking the 5? and 3? homology arms. All positive clones and randomly selected negative clones were then confirmed by Southern blotting using the 5? probe indicated in Figure 1a . Positive clones were thawed, expanded and injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts following the standard protocol. Chimaeras were mated with C57BL/6 mice and the germline transmission in agouti offspring were confirmed by genotyping PCR. The neomycin selection cassette was later excised in vivo by crossing with Rosa26-FLPe mice (The Jackson Laboratory). ?-galactosidase (?-gal) staining To prepare sections of all organs except the retina, mice were perfused and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4°C, cryo-protected in 20 % sucrose overnight at 4°C and frozen in OCT. Frozen sections were washed in PBS for 5 min and incubated in the dark in standard ?-gal substrate (5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 1 mg/ml X-gal, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% NP-40 in PBS) overnight at 37°C. To stain the retina, mouse eyes were removed and immersed immediately in cold PBS. The retina was isolated from the eyes and fixed at room temperature in 0.5% gluteraldhyde/PBS for 10 minutes, washed briefly and incubated in the rinse buffer (2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% NP-40 in PBS) for 30 minutes. The retina was subsequently stained in the same ?-gal substrate for 30 minutes at 37°C, rinsed in PBS and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight. The retina was cryo-protected in 20 % sucrose for two hours before frozen in OCT. Microscopy Standard immunofluorescence (IF) staining was performed on 16 ?m frozen sections and immunohistochemistry on 5 ?m paraffin sections. Antibodies included rat anti-Prom1 (eBioscience, 14-1331, 1:100), mouse anti-nestin (Millipore, MAB353, 1:50), rabbit anti-uteroglobin (or CCSP) (Abcam, ab40873, 1:1000), mouse anti-rhodopsin (gift from Dr. Michael Dyer, ref. 30 , 1:500), rabbit anti-Ki67 (Vector, VP-RM04, 1:2000), mouse anti-?-catenin (BD, 610154, 1:200), chicken anti-?-gal (Abcam, ab9361, 1:1000), rabbit anti-?-gal (MP, 55976, 1:1000), rabbit anti-synaptophysin (Dako, A 0010, 1:150), rabbit anti-amylase (Sigma, A8273, 1:1000), guinea pig anti-insulin (Dako, A 0564, 1:250). Two lectins: fluorescein-labeled Dolichos Biflorus Agglutinin (DBA) (Vector, FL-1031, 1:200), fluorescein-labeled Lotus Tetragonolobus Lectin (LTL) (Vector, FL-1321, 1:200). To obtain the kidney images in Figure 1c , the same section was sequentially stained with X-gal followed by Prom1/LTL co-IF. The same sequential X-gal/IF staining was performed for Supplemental Figure 2b . All cell counts in tissue sections were performed blind to genotype and tamoxifen treatment. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) To obtain Lgr5 probe, T3 promoter sequence (CATTCACTTTTGGCCGTTTT) was added to Lgr5 sense oligo and T7 promoter sequence (AAGTCATGGGGTAAGCTGGTG) to the antisense oligo. Lgr5 template was amplified from its cDNA clone (BC156649) and the 828 bp PCR product was used as the template to generate Dig-cRNA probe (Roche). Probes to the mouse Prom1 mRNA was similarly generated from its cDNA clone (BC028286). 4% PFA fixed frozen sections were pre-treated in graded alcohols from 70% to 100% to facilitate penetration of Dig-labeled cRNA probes. Sections were then incubated in the hybridization buffer (500 ng/ml Dig-labeled cRNA probe, 50% formaldehyde, 4X SSC, 250 ?g/ml tRNA, 200 ?g/ml ssDNA and 10% dextran sulfate) at 55°C overnight. Following incubation sections were washed in degraded SSC buffers and incubated with anti-Dig antibody (Roche, 1:600) for 1.5 hours at room temperature. Sections were subsequently washed and colorized with NCBI/NBT (Roche) for 3-16 hours, counterstained with methyl green and mounted with 2% gelatin. Culture of intestinal crypt stem cells Small intestines were excised from each of two Prom1 +/C-L ; RosaYFP and two Prom1 +/C-L ; RosaYFP ; Ctnnb1 +/lox(ex3) mice induced with tamoxifen 2 days prior to sacrifice, and rinsed repeatedly with sterile PBS. Crypts were isolated by incubating minced intestines with 3mM EDTA and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ for 90 minutes at room temperature followed by vigorous shaking for 30 seconds to release large sheets of cells from their calcium- and magnesium-dependent interactions with the basement membrane and stromal cells. These were collected by centrifugation at 500 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature. To obtain a single-cell suspension, pelleted cells were incubated in 0.3% pancreatin (Sigma) in PBS for 90 min. at room temperature. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature, washed with 3 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and grown in RPMI supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml Penicillin, 100 ?g/ml Streptomicin and 2.5% FBS. Colonies formed after approximately 4 weeks in culture. Reverse transcription PCR Total RNA was isolated from the kidney of adult Prom1 +/C-L and Prom1 C-L/C-L mice following standard Trizol/chloroform/isopropanol protocol. 1 ?g RNA was reverse transcribed using the iScript™ reverse transcription kit (Bio-Rad, 170-8890). cDNA was then amplified using Taq polymerase and gene specific primers for the 5?end of the Prom1 transcript (5?- GAGTCCTTATCTGCGCCATC -3?, 5?- CTGCTCCCCAGACTGCTTAG-3?), 3?end of the Prom1 transcript (5?-GGATTGCAAAAGAGGTCGAG-3?, 5?-AATTCAGAGGGTCCGCAAC-3?), and GAPDH (5?-TGTTCCAGTATGACTCCACTCACG-3?, 5?-GCCCTTCCACAATGCCAAAG-3?). Target sequences were amplified within linear ranges using 95°C/30 seconds, 60°C/30 seconds and 72°C/50 seconds conditions. All primer pairs amplified regions crossing intron borders.
