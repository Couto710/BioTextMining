Inflammation and hemostasis biomarkers for predicting stroke in postmenopausal women: The Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study Background Inflammatory and hemostasis-related biomarkers may identify women at risk of stroke. Methods Hormones and Biomarkers Predicting Stroke is a study of ischemic stroke among postmenopausal women participating in the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study (n = 972 case-control pairs). A Biomarker Risk Score was derived from levels of seven inflammatory and hemostasis-related biomarkers that appeared individually to predict risk of ischemic stroke: C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tissue plasminogen activator, D-dimer, white blood cell count, neopterin, and homocysteine. The c index was used to evaluate discrimination. Results Of all the individual biomarkers examined, C-reactive protein emerged as the only independent single predictor of ischemic stroke (adjusted odds ratio comparing Q4 versus Q1 = 1.64, 95% confidence interval: 1.15–2.32, p = 0.01) after adjustment for other biomarkers and standard stroke risk factors. The Biomarker Risk Score identified a gradient of increasing stroke risk with a greater number of elevated inflammatory/hemostasis biomarkers, and improved the c index significantly compared with standard stroke risk factors (p = 0.02). Among the subset of individuals who met current criteria for “high risk” levels of C-reactive protein (> 3.0 mg/L), the Biomarker Risk Score defined an approximately two-fold gradient of risk. We found no evidence for a relationship between stroke and levels of E-selectin, fibrinogen, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, prothrombin fragment 1+2, Factor VIIC, or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen (p >0.15). Discussion The findings support the further exploration of multiple-biomarker panels to develop approaches for stratifying an individual’s risk of stroke.  Subject characteristics The follow-up time in years was, for stroke cases, mean=4.4, SD=2.3, median=4.5, and for control subjects, mean=7.9, SD=1.3, median=8.0. Ischemic stroke cases were more likely than controls to be current smokers, to have high BMI, and to report a history of atrial fibrillation, angina or revascularization ( Table 1 ). Additionally, cases were more likely to have hypertension, diabetes, and use of lipid-lowering drugs and aspirin. Significant correlations among inflammatory and hemostasis biomarkers were observed, ranging as high as r = 0.51 (p < 0.001) for Factor VII and prothrombin fragment 1+2, and r = 0.47 (p < 0.001) for CRP and IL6 ( Table 2 ). Significant differences (p < 0.05) were present between matched cases and controls in median baseline levels of several of the biomarkers under study (CRP, IL-6, tPA, WBC, neopterin, E-selectin, TNF-alpha, and VCAM-1), whereas case-control differences in D-dimer, homocysteine, and PAI-1 antigen were of borderline statistical significance (p = 0.05 –0.10) ( Table 3 ).  Biomarkers and risk of ischemic stroke We examined the associations of incident ischemic stroke with levels of each individual biomarker. In analyses of linear trends across biomarker quartiles, the associations for CRP (ptrend < 0.001), IL-6 (ptrend < 0.001), tPA (ptrend = 0.02), D-dimer (ptrend = 0.03) and WBC (ptrend = 0.03), met the standard p < 0.05 criteria for statistical significance in models that adjusted for aspirin use, BMI, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, smoking, high cholesterol requiring pills, anti-hypertensive medication use, fasting glucose, LDL and HDL cholesterol ( Table 4 ). Biomarkers for which the trends across quartiles were of borderline significance (p = 0.05 to p = 0.15) were neopterin (ptrend = 0.05) and homocysteine (ptrend = 0.10). Similar results were observed in analyses that compared individuals in the highest versus the lowest quartiles of biomarkers. Specifically, significant (p < 0.05) associations were found for quartile comparisons of CRP (adjusted OR comparing Q4 versus Q1 = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.32–2.39), IL-6 (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.25–2.26), tPA (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.03–1.94), D-dimer (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.12–2.08) and WBC (OR = 1.46, 95%CI: 1.10–1.94), There was no evidence for a relationship between risk of incident ischemic stroke and levels of E-selectin, fibrinogen, TNF-alpha, VCAM-1, prothrombin fragment 1+2, Factor VIIC, or PAI-1 antigen, either as analyses of quartile trends or comparisons of extreme quartiles. In models that included CRP, IL-6, tPA, D-dimer, WBC neopterin and homocysteine together as predictor variables, CRP retained an independent association with risk of ischemic stroke (adjusted OR comparing Q4 versus Q1 = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.15–2.32, ptrend = 0.01) ( Table 4 ). The only other biomarker that achieved even a borderline level of statistical significance when multiple biomarkers were included in models was tPA (adjusted OR comparing Q4 versus Q1 = 1.35, 95% CI: 0.96–1.89, ptrend = 0.06). In analyses of CRP in relation to subtypes of stroke, the adjusted OR comparing Q4 versus Q1 was 2.27 (95% CI = 1.35, 3.84) for cardioembolic stroke (n=186 cases), 1.35 (95% CI = 0.67, 2.70) for large-artery stroke (n=86 cases), and 1.68 (95% CI = 1.07, 2.63) for small-vessel stroke (n=230 cases).  Biomarker Risk Score and risk of ischemic stroke Biomarker Risk Score was derived based on levels of seven biomarkers that met predefined statistical criteria (ptrend <0.15): CRP, IL-6, tPA, D-Dimer, WBC, neopterin, and homocysteine. Individuals were assigned one point for each biomarker measurement that was in the top quartile of the control distribution. In multivariate analyses, Biomarker Risk Score was an independent predictor of ischemic stroke, after adjusting for stroke risk factors (p < 0.001) ( Figure 1 ). Higher Biomarker Risk Score predicted all major etiologic subtypes of stroke ( Figure 2 ). In stratified analyses with tests for interaction, we found no evidence that the ORs describing the association between Biomarker Risk Score and risk of ischemic stroke differed across subgroups of age, estrogen/progestin use, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, race, HDL cholesterol, or LDL cholesterol. The c index for prediction of stroke was 0.633 (95% CI: 0.605–0.660) for a model that included standard stroke risk factors (age, race/ethnicity, aspirin use, BMI, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, anti-hypertensive medication use, smoking, lipid-lowering medication use, fasting glucose, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol) but not the Biomarker Risk Score. Addition of the Biomarker Risk Score to the model improved the c index to 0.649 (95% CI: 0.622–0.677), which was a statistically significant increase as compared with the standard stroke risk factor model (p = 0.02). A model including standard stroke risk factors and CRP alone had a c index of 0.640 (95% CI: 0.613–0.668, p = 0.15 as compared with the standard stroke risk factor model). The addition of the Biomarker Risk Score to the model containing CRP and standard stroke risk factors produced a non-significant increase in the c index (p = 0.09).  Biomarker Risk Score and CRP Additional analyses examined the association of the Biomarker Risk Score with risk of stroke among subjects with CRP above and below the “high risk” level of 3.0 mg/L. For these analyses, the reference group was defined as individuals who had CRP <= 3.0 mg/L and who had a Biomarker Risk Score of zero (ie, no elevated biomarkers). A gradient of increasing risk was observed across increasing numbers of elevated biomarkers, particularly among individuals with high CRP ( Figure 3 ). Among individuals with levels of CRP > 3.0 mg/L, almost 40% had zero or one other elevated biomarkers (ie, 15.2% had Biomarker Risk Score = 1 and 23.8% had Biomarker Risk Score = 2). Among these individuals who had high CRP but <= 1 other elevated biomarkers, risk of stroke was similar as compared with those who had CRP below the 3.0 mg/L threshold but who had elevated levels of 1 or more other biomarkers ( Figure 3 ). In analyses of Biomarker Risk Score as continuous variable, the adjusted odds ratio per unit was 1.12 (95% CI: 0.99–1.28) for those with CRP < =3.0 mg/L, and the adjusted odds ratio per unit was 1.26 (95% CI: 1.13–1.40) for those with CRP >3.0 mg/L (p for interaction = 0.53). The addition of the Biomarker Risk Score to the model containing standard stroke risk factors significantly improved the c index both among subjects with CRP < = 3.0 mg/L (p = 0.04) and among subjects with CRP > 3.0 mg/L (p = 0.03). These results stratified on CRP were changed little after residual adjustment for CRP levels.

Discussion The findings support the further exploration of multiple-biomarker panels to develop approaches for stratifying an individual’s risk of stroke.  Methods Study Population The present investigation is part of the Hormones and Biomarkers Predicting Stroke (HaBPS) study, a case-control study of incident ischemic stroke nested within the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study. A total of 93,676 postmenopausal 50–79 year old women were recruited from October 1993 through December 1998. Women ineligible or not interested in the WHI clinical trial components, which examined postmenopausal hormone therapy, low-fat diet, and calcium/vitamin D supplementation, were given an opportunity to enroll in the Observational Study, and others were recruited specifically for Observational Study participation. Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent were obtained. Data Collection All women who enrolled in WHI completed visits at baseline to determine eligibility and collect data including questionnaires, physical measurements, biological specimens, and laboratory tests. During an initial visit, a physical examination was performed by trained staff using standardized procedures to obtain height and weight and seated blood pressure. Fasting blood samples were collected at study baseline by clinic staff who followed a standardized protocol for venipuncture, centrifugation and separation of blood, freezing of specimens on site at ?70C, and shipping of specimens to the central WHI repository for long-term storage. Questionnaires elicited information on many health-related factors including medical history, health behaviors including smoking habits, and demographics. Use of prescription drugs was inventoried. Variable definition Hypertension was defined as self-report of hypertension diagnosis with anti-hypertensive medication use, and/or systolic blood pressure >= 140 mm Hg, and/or diastolic blood pressure >=90 mm Hg. Diabetes was defined as being on treatment for diabetes by self-report and/or having a fasting glucose level >=126mg/dl. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from measured weight and height as kg/m2. A prior diagnosis of high cholesterol requiring pills was determined by self-report. Follow-up and outcome ascertainment All incident strokes, other vascular events, and deaths were identified through self report at annual participant contacts and through third-party reports by family members and proxies. Medical records were obtained for potential strokes and other pre-defined health events, and adjudication was performed locally by trained physician adjudicators who assigned a diagnosis according to standard criteria. As part of the HaBPS study, all locally adjudicated strokes were then sent for central adjudication by study neurologists (DMR, AEB, JL). Ischemic stroke was defined as the rapid onset of a persistent neurologic deficit attributed to an obstruction lasting more than 24 hours and without evidence for other causes. Stroke subtype was defined using Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria [ 17 ]. Only stroke events that required hospitalization were considered as potential outcomes. Case and control subject identification For the HaBPS case-control study, cases included the first 972 confirmed incident ischemic strokes occurring between study baseline and July 1, 2003. All cases not verified during central adjudication as being an ischemic stroke were excluded, including transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or hemorrhagic strokes. Control subjects were matched individually to the cases according to age (2 years), race/ethnicity, date of enrollment, and follow-up time. Women with a history of myocardial infarction or stroke at baseline were excluded from both the case and control groups. Biomarker Measurement Stored blood specimens were sent to the WHI core laboratory for measurement of levels of plasma CRP, IL-6, TNF-?, neopterin, E-selectin, VCAM, Factor VII, prothrombin fragment 1+2, tPA, PAI-1, fibrinogen, and homocysteine, as well as fasting plasma glucose and lipids. These laboratory tests were performed between September 2005 and March 2006, approximately 7 to 12 years since specimen collection (depending on when participants were enrolled). Baseline blood samples had been sent to a local laboratory for analysis of white blood cell count at the time of collection. Statistical Analyses To compare characteristics of cases and matched controls, the McNemar’s Chi-square test was used for categorical variables. We examined distributions of biomarkers to assess the need for normalizing transformations and identify outlying values. Due to non-normality of several biomarkers, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks were used to compare levels of median biomarkers between the matched case-control pairs. Spearman correlations between all biomarkers were calculated among the controls. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression, with adjustment for matching factors and confounders, was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across quartiles of biomarkers. Quartile cut points were defined according to the distribution of biomarkers among controls. Significance tests were computed using two approaches: 1) fitting an ordinal variable for biomarker quartiles as a continuous variable; and 2) examining the OR comparing extreme biomarker quartiles. To examine the joint predictive value of several biomarkers, we derived a Biomarker Risk Score (BRS) by assigning 1 point for each biomarker value that was in the highest quartile of the control group distribution. Biomarkers that were used in computing the BRS were those that were individually associated with stroke at ptrend < 0.15 when modeled as a trend across quartiles; this liberal significance level reflects our hypothesis that a biomarker may contribute importantly to a multiple-biomarker strategy even if it did not achieve the conventional level of statistical significance in its individual association with stroke risk. We examined the association of BRS with risk of stroke using logistic regression models, both overall and in subgroups defined by CRP above and below 3.0 mg/L, which is the cutoff for defining high CRP in currently-available guidelines[ 18 ]. Models adjusted for the matching variables age and race/ethnicity, and were additionally adjusted for aspirin use, BMI, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, anti-hypertensive medication use, smoking, lipid-lowering medication use, fasting glucose, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Additional adjustment for history of atrial fibrillation, diastolic blood pressure, history of revascularization or estrogen and progestin therapy did not affect the results substantially. To assess variation in associations by stroke subtype, we determined the ORs for incident stroke in subgroups of women defined by the TOAST classification. We also examined for effect modification by age, hormone use, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, race, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. Adjusted models were based on women for whom complete data were available on all covariates of interest. To assess the ability of models to discriminate between ischemic strokes and controls we calculated the c index, with the use of cross-validation methods to reduce bias introduced by the use of the same population to develop and evaluate models [ 19 ]  Study Population The present investigation is part of the Hormones and Biomarkers Predicting Stroke (HaBPS) study, a case-control study of incident ischemic stroke nested within the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study.

Additionally, cases were more likely to have hypertension, diabetes, and use of lipid-lowering drugs and aspirin. Significant correlations among inflammatory and hemostasis biomarkers were observed, ranging as high as r = 0.51 (p < 0.001) for Factor VII and prothrombin fragment 1+2, and r = 0.47 (p < 0.001) for CRP and IL6 ( Table 2 ). Significant differences (p < 0.05) were present between matched cases and controls in median baseline levels of several of the biomarkers under study (CRP, IL-6, tPA, WBC, neopterin, E-selectin, TNF-alpha, and VCAM-1), whereas case-control differences in D-dimer, homocysteine, and PAI-1 antigen were of borderline statistical significance (p = 0.05 –0.10) ( Table 3 ). Biomarkers and risk of ischemic stroke We examined the associations of incident ischemic stroke with levels of each individual biomarker. In analyses of linear trends across biomarker quartiles, the associations for CRP (ptrend < 0.001), IL-6 (ptrend < 0.001), tPA (ptrend = 0.02), D-dimer (ptrend = 0.03) and WBC (ptrend = 0.03), met the standard p < 0.05 criteria for statistical significance in models that adjusted for aspirin use, BMI, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, smoking, high cholesterol requiring pills, anti-hypertensive medication use, fasting glucose, LDL and HDL cholesterol ( Table 4 ). Biomarkers for which the trends across quartiles were of borderline significance (p = 0.05 to p = 0.15) were neopterin (ptrend = 0.05) and homocysteine (ptrend = 0.10). Similar results were observed in analyses that compared individuals in the highest versus the lowest quartiles of biomarkers. Specifically, significant (p < 0.05) associations were found for quartile comparisons of CRP (adjusted OR comparing Q4 versus Q1 = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.32–2.39), IL-6 (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.25–2.26), tPA (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.03–1.94), D-dimer (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.12–2.08) and WBC (OR = 1.46, 95%CI: 1.10–1.94), There was no evidence for a relationship between risk of incident ischemic stroke and levels of E-selectin, fibrinogen, TNF-alpha, VCAM-1, prothrombin fragment 1+2, Factor VIIC, or PAI-1 antigen, either as analyses of quartile trends or comparisons of extreme quartiles. In models that included CRP, IL-6, tPA, D-dimer, WBC neopterin and homocysteine together as predictor variables, CRP retained an independent association with risk of ischemic stroke (adjusted OR comparing Q4 versus Q1 = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.15–2.32, ptrend = 0.01) ( Table 4 ). The only other biomarker that achieved even a borderline level of statistical significance when multiple biomarkers were included in models was tPA (adjusted OR comparing Q4 versus Q1 = 1.35, 95% CI: 0.96–1.89, ptrend = 0.06). In analyses of CRP in relation to subtypes of stroke, the adjusted OR comparing Q4 versus Q1 was 2.27 (95% CI = 1.35, 3.84) for cardioembolic stroke (n=186 cases), 1.35 (95% CI = 0.67, 2.70) for large-artery stroke (n=86 cases), and 1.68 (95% CI = 1.07, 2.63) for small-vessel stroke (n=230 cases).

The addition of the Biomarker Risk Score to the model containing standard stroke risk factors significantly improved the c index both among subjects with CRP < = 3.0 mg/L (p = 0.04) and among subjects with CRP > 3.0 mg/L (p = 0.03). These results stratified on CRP were changed little after residual adjustment for CRP levels.

Biomarkers for which the trends across quartiles were of borderline significance (p = 0.05 to p = 0.15) were neopterin (ptrend = 0.05) and homocysteine (ptrend = 0.10). Similar results were observed in analyses that compared individuals in the highest versus the lowest quartiles of biomarkers. Specifically, significant (p < 0.05) associations were found for quartile comparisons of CRP (adjusted OR comparing Q4 versus Q1 = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.32–2.39), IL-6 (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.25–2.26), tPA (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.03–1.94), D-dimer (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.12–2.08) and WBC (OR = 1.46, 95%CI: 1.10–1.94), There was no evidence for a relationship between risk of incident ischemic stroke and levels of E-selectin, fibrinogen, TNF-alpha, VCAM-1, prothrombin fragment 1+2, Factor VIIC, or PAI-1 antigen, either as analyses of quartile trends or comparisons of extreme quartiles. In models that included CRP, IL-6, tPA, D-dimer, WBC neopterin and homocysteine together as predictor variables, CRP retained an independent association with risk of ischemic stroke (adjusted OR comparing Q4 versus Q1 = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.15–2.32, ptrend = 0.01) ( Table 4 ). The only other biomarker that achieved even a borderline level of statistical significance when multiple biomarkers were included in models was tPA (adjusted OR comparing Q4 versus Q1 = 1.35, 95% CI: 0.96–1.89, ptrend = 0.06). In analyses of CRP in relation to subtypes of stroke, the adjusted OR comparing Q4 versus Q1 was 2.27 (95% CI = 1.35, 3.84) for cardioembolic stroke (n=186 cases), 1.35 (95% CI = 0.67, 2.70) for large-artery stroke (n=86 cases), and 1.68 (95% CI = 1.07, 2.63) for small-vessel stroke (n=230 cases). Biomarker Risk Score and risk of ischemic stroke Biomarker Risk Score was derived based on levels of seven biomarkers that met predefined statistical criteria (ptrend <0.15): CRP, IL-6, tPA, D-Dimer, WBC, neopterin, and homocysteine. Individuals were assigned one point for each biomarker measurement that was in the top quartile of the control distribution. In multivariate analyses, Biomarker Risk Score was an independent predictor of ischemic stroke, after adjusting for stroke risk factors (p < 0.001) ( Figure 1 ). Higher Biomarker Risk Score predicted all major etiologic subtypes of stroke ( Figure 2 ). In stratified analyses with tests for interaction, we found no evidence that the ORs describing the association between Biomarker Risk Score and risk of ischemic stroke differed across subgroups of age, estrogen/progestin use, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, race, HDL cholesterol, or LDL cholesterol. The c index for prediction of stroke was 0.633 (95% CI: 0.605–0.660) for a model that included standard stroke risk factors (age, race/ethnicity, aspirin use, BMI, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, anti-hypertensive medication use, smoking, lipid-lowering medication use, fasting glucose, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol) but not the Biomarker Risk Score. Addition of the Biomarker Risk Score to the model improved the c index to 0.649 (95% CI: 0.622–0.677), which was a statistically significant increase as compared with the standard stroke risk factor model (p = 0.02). A model including standard stroke risk factors and CRP alone had a c index of 0.640 (95% CI: 0.613–0.668, p = 0.15 as compared with the standard stroke risk factor model). The addition of the Biomarker Risk Score to the model containing CRP and standard stroke risk factors produced a non-significant increase in the c index (p = 0.09). Biomarker Risk Score and CRP Additional analyses examined the association of the Biomarker Risk Score with risk of stroke among subjects with CRP above and below the “high risk” level of 3.0 mg/L. For these analyses, the reference group was defined as individuals who had CRP <= 3.0 mg/L and who had a Biomarker Risk Score of zero (ie, no elevated biomarkers). A gradient of increasing risk was observed across increasing numbers of elevated biomarkers, particularly among individuals with high CRP ( Figure 3 ). Among individuals with levels of CRP > 3.0 mg/L, almost 40% had zero or one other elevated biomarkers (ie, 15.2% had Biomarker Risk Score = 1 and 23.8% had Biomarker Risk Score = 2). Among these individuals who had high CRP but <= 1 other elevated biomarkers, risk of stroke was similar as compared with those who had CRP below the 3.0 mg/L threshold but who had elevated levels of 1 or more other biomarkers ( Figure 3 ). In analyses of Biomarker Risk Score as continuous variable, the adjusted odds ratio per unit was 1.12 (95% CI: 0.99–1.28) for those with CRP < =3.0 mg/L, and the adjusted odds ratio per unit was 1.26 (95% CI: 1.13–1.40) for those with CRP >3.0 mg/L (p for interaction = 0.53). The addition of the Biomarker Risk Score to the model containing standard stroke risk factors significantly improved the c index both among subjects with CRP < = 3.0 mg/L (p = 0.04) and among subjects with CRP > 3.0 mg/L (p = 0.03). These results stratified on CRP were changed little after residual adjustment for CRP levels.  Discussion A multiple-biomarker index (Biomarker Risk Score) derived from levels of seven biomarkers of inflammation and hemostasis (CRP, IL-6, tPA, D-Dimer, WBC, neopterin, and homocysteine) defined a gradient of ischemic stroke risk across this population of 50 to 79 year old postmenopausal women. Discrimination between stroke cases and controls ( c index) was significantly improved with addition of the Biomarker Risk Score to standard stroke risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, and smoking. In the present study, CRP was the only single biomarker that remained associated with stroke after adjustment for standard stroke risk factors and other inflammation and hemostasis-related biomarkers. CRP is a well-established vascular risk factor [ 18 ], although the risk associated with elevated CRP may be weaker than previously believed [ 14 ]. Moreover, fewer studies of CRP have examined ischemic stroke than have examined coronary disease, and the importance of CRP may be less in older adults than in middle-aged populations. Data from the Women’s Health Study (mean age 53.7 years) suggested that CRP was more strongly associated with risk of ischemic stroke than with risk of coronary events (for stroke, adjusted hazard ratio comparing CRP Tertile 3 [T3] versus Tertile 1 [T1] = 2.76, 95% CI: 1.51–5.05; for coronary disease, adjusted hazard ratio comparing CRP T3 versus T1 = 1.66, 95% CI:1.17– 2.34) [ 15 ]. In the present cohort (50 to 79 year old, median age 69 years), results were consistent with this finding but the association was weaker and appeared to be confined to the upper quartile (adjusted OR comparing CRP Q4 versus Q1 = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.15–2.32). Other studies have produced conflicting evidence on the association of CRP with ischemic stroke in older adults. In the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) cohort, elevated levels of CRP did not predict risk of stroke among men and women 65 years and older who were free of prior angina, myocardial infarction, or stroke; in CHS, an association between CRP and stroke was only observed among those older adults who had an increased burden of subclinical atherosclerosis as indicated by carotid artery wall thickness [ 1 , 3 ]. The Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study found that IL-6 and TNF- ?, but not CRP, were associated with stroke, heart failure, and coronary disease among 70 to 79 year old adults[ 12 ]. In the Rotterdam (>= 55 years old) [ 16 ] and Copenhagen (50 to 89 years old) [ 13 ] cohorts, elevated CRP had no significant association with risk of stroke after adjustment for standard stroke risk factors. Notable strengths of the present study, shared by some but not all prior investigations, included large sample size, with more than 900 incident strokes and a comparably-sized control population, and neurologist review of medical records to confirm stroke events. Present clinical guidelines have endorsed measurement of CRP level as an adjunct to standard CVD risk factor screening for guiding CVD prevention efforts [ 18 ], and new CVD risk stratification algorithms that have been proposed include CRP in addition to established risk factors [ 20 ]. Our study raises the question of whether multiple biomarkers reflecting inflammation or hemostasis might be useful when measured in addition to CRP. For example, a Biomarker Risk Score defined as the total number of inflammation and hemostasis biomarkers that were elevated (ie, in the upper quartile) revealed an approximate two-fold gradient in stroke risk among individuals who had “high risk” CRP levels (>= 3.0 mg/L) [ 18 ]. Among women with CRP above 3.0 mg/L, nearly 50% had zero or 1 other elevated biomarkers, and these individuals had a risk of stroke that was similar to those who had CRP below high-risk levels (< 3.0 mg/L) but who had elevated levels of 1 or more other biomarkers. Thus, our data suggest that among individuals with CRP levels in the “high-risk” category, measurement of other inflammatory and hemostasis biomarkers may be clinically useful to provide additional stratification of stroke risk. In addition to CRP, this study examined other candidate biomarkers that were selected to reflect a variety of relevant etiologic pathways including inflammation, atherosclerosis, platelet activity, coagulation, and fibrinolysis. We confirmed that modest elevations in WBC, an acute-phase reactant, may reflect global inflammation and increased stroke risk, as shown previously in this population and others [ 21 , 22 ]. IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine and trigger for liver release of CRP, and we confirmed its previously-reported association with risk of stroke [ 5 , 7 , 12 ]. Two of the other biomarkers that we identified as stroke risk factors reflect fibrinolytic activity, including tPA, the main activator of fibrinolysis, and D-dimer, a marker of fibrin turnover. Both have been previously implicated as vascular risk factors [ 9 , 10 ]. Also worthy of note are negative findings for several biomarkers in the present study. For example, a recent meta-analysis of over 31 prospective epidemiological studies suggested that elevated levels of fibrinogen, which is involved in inflammation, platelet aggregation, and coagulation cascades, predict the risk of ischemic stroke as well as other vascular events among healthy adults [ 23 ]. However, our data showed no significant association between fibrinogen and stroke among postmenopausal women. This appears to confirm prior findings from the Cardiovascular Health Study that fibrinogen does not predict stroke among older women, although it does among older men [ 24 ]. Limitations of the present study include a lack of data among men and premenopausal females, limiting the ability to generalize results to these groups. We also lacked comparative data for multiple vascular endpoints in addition to stroke, and had limited statistical power for subgroup analyses by race/ethnicity. It is important to note that this observational study is not able to evaluate whether the identified biomarkers play a causal etiologic role or whether their modification may alter risk of stroke. Validation of these results in another population will be important, although we used cross-validation methods to address the lack of an external validation cohort. It is important to note that biomarkers were only measured at baseline, and may have changed during follow-up due to biological within-individual variation or initiation of medications that affect inflammation, endothelial function, and coagulation status. Among several inflammatory and hemostasis-related biomarkers that were studied, we identified elevated CRP level as the strongest independent risk factor for stroke among postmenopausal women. A Biomarker Risk Score derived from levels of several biomarkers provided additional useful information for stratifying stroke risk. The findings support the further exploration of multiple-biomarker panels for more accurately stratifying an individual’s risk of stroke, possibly based upon emerging multiplex assay technologies that may reduce technical and cost barriers [ 25 ].
