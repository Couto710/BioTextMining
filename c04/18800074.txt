The role of the RB tumour suppressor pathway in oxidative stress responses in the haematopoietic system Exposure to pro-oxidants and defects in the repair of oxidative base damage are associated with disease and ageing and also contribute to the development of anaemia, bone marrow failure and haematopoietic malignancies. This Review assesses emerging data indicative of a specific role for the RB tumour suppressor pathway in the response of the haematopoietic system to oxidative stress. This is mediated through signalling pathways that involve DNA damage sensors, forkhead box O (Foxo) transcription factors and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and has downstream consequences for cell cycle progression, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial mass and cellular metabolism.
