Genetic and Molecular Abnormalities in Cholangiocarcinogenesis Cholangiocarcinomas are biliary tree neoplasms of cholangiocyte origin. Several clinical risk factors are associated with cholangiocarcinogenesis. During the last decade, there has been an increasing interest in the causative molecular mechanisms of cholangiocarcinoma because of its poor prognosis and the lack of effective therapies. A better understanding of cholangiocarcinoma tumor initiation, promotion, and progression, as well as neurotransmitter, neuroendocrine, and endocrine growth effects, may elucidate molecular targets for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.  Conclusion Continued genetic and molecular research is crucial because of the rising incidence of cholangiocarinoma and the lack of effective treatments. The high frequency of late-stage diagnosis is a major difficulty facing surgeons treating cholangiocarcinoma because this limits the possibility of a curative resection. The development of novel therapeutic approaches based on tumor biology is among the goals of modern medicine. Putative molecular targets such as PTGS2 and NOS2 inhibitors can potentially affect the incidence and growth of cholangiocarcinoma when used as prophylactic and therapeutic options, respectively. Future studies focusing on the discussed genetic and molecular targets will help develop more effective therapies to treat cholangiocarcinoma when curative resection is unlikely.
