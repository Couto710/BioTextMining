The Stem Cell-Associated Antigen CD133 (Prominin-1) Is a Molecular Therapeutic Target for Metastatic Melanoma CD133 (Prominin-1) is considered the most important cancer stem cell (CSC)-associated marker identified so far, with increased expression in the CSC fraction of a large variety of human malignancies, including melanoma. Here we investigated the effects of CD133 downregulation in vitro and in vivo in human metastatic melanoma. The average number of CD133 molecules on the cell surface of FEMX-I melanoma cells was decreased by 8.7-fold and 1.8-fold using two different short hairpin RNAs. Downregulation of CD133, confirmed by immunocytochemistry, Western blotting, microarray analysis, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, resulted in slower cell growth, reduced cell motility, and decreased capacity to form spheroids under stem cell-like growth conditions. Clonal analysis revealed that the reduction in growth rate was proportional to the extent of CD133 downregulation. Monoclonal antibodies directed against two different epitopes of the CD133 protein induced a specific, dose-dependent cytotoxic effect in FEMX-I cells. The downregulation of CD133 severely reduced the capacity of the cells to metastasize, particularly to the spinal cord. In the CD133 downregulated cells, microarray analysis revealed expression changes for only 143 annotated genes (76 up- and 67 downregulated). Ten of the 76 upregulated genes coded for Wnt inhibitors, suggesting an interaction between CD133 and the canonical Wnt pathway. We conclude that CD133, in addition to its role as a CSC marker, is an important therapeutic target for metastatic melanoma and, potentially, for other CD133-expressing cancer types.  INTRODUCTION The incidence of melanoma is increasing in white populations worldwide, and its associated mortality has not changed considerably over the last decades. Clearly, identification of the subpopulation responsible for melanoma progression and metastasis is needed, to tailor appropriate systemic therapies. Melanoma stem/initiating cells have been proposed to exist [ 1 – 3 ]. Recently, Schatton et al. [ 2 ] found that primitive cells capable of recapitulating human melanomas in xenotransplantation models can be marked by the ABCB5 transporter, which is associated with CD133 expression. CD133 (Prominin-1) is the first identified gene in a class of novel pentaspan membrane proteins, named prominin for its prominent location on the protrusion of cell membranes [ 4 , 5 ]. Its physiological function is presently unknown. Originally classified as a marker of primitive hematopoietic and neural stem cells, CD133 has been described in a growing body of literature in relation to somatic stem cells, and has been recognized as the most important marker inherent to a number of types of cancer stem/initiating cells (CSCs) identified to date [ 6 – 9 ]. In this regard, the development of future therapies toward targeting CSCs via CD133 and a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that regulate the behavior of CD133-expressing cells represent very important areas of research. So far, the Wnt, Notch, and bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathways have been implicated in the control of CD133+ CSC function in different studies [ 10 – 12 ]. In the present study, we sought to determine whether downregulation of CD133 in human FEMX-I metastatic melanoma resulted in biological changes in vitro and in vivo. Our findings strongly suggest that CD133 is an important potential target per se for antimelanoma therapy.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction of Anti-CD133 Short Hairpin RNA-Retroviral Vectors The vector pSUPER.retro.neo + GFP (pSUPER) from OligoEngine (Seattle, WA, http://www.oligoengine.com ) was used to generate retroviral plasmids that express short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), based on the cDNA of CD133, corresponding to nucleotides 773–792 (GACCCAACATCATCCCTGT) and 1,618–1,637 (TTGGATACACCCTACTTAC); Genbank accession no. NM006017. BLAST research ensured that the sequences have no significant homology with other human genes. As control vectors, we used the same plasmids carrying shRNA sequences nonspecific to any human gene. To generate retroviral producers, pSUPER773, pSUPER1618, and pSUPERctr as a control were introduced into the Phoenix-gp packaging cell line together with a plasmid expressing the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) glycoprotein by the calcium phosphate/chloroquine transfection method. Viral particle-containing supernatants were collected at 24–48 hours, filtered, and stored at ?80°C. In all experiments, a multiplicity of infection of 1–2 was used, to limit the expected integration frequency. Cell Culture and Cytotoxicity Assays The FEMX-I cell line was originally derived from a lymph node metastasis of a patient with metastatic melanoma [ 13 ]. FEMX-I cells were cultured in RPMI (Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA, http://www.cellgro.com ) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA, http://www.atlantabio.com) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Cells were used between passages 3 and 15 and tested routinely for mycoplasma contamination. For trypan blue proliferation assays, cells were seeded at the same density on day 0. Each subsequent day, the cells were detached by trypsin-EDTA and blocked with serum-supplemented culture medium. After addition of equal volumes of trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com ) to cell aliquots, trypan blue-excluding cells were counted for a total of 5 days. For spheroid formation, cells were enzymatically detached and plated under stem cell-like conditions, that is, at clonal density (300–500/cm2) in serum-free medium, consisting of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/Ham’s F-12 low osmolality medium in the presence of B27 supplement (both from Gibco, Grand Island, NY, http://www.invitrogen.com ) and growth factors (1,000 IU/ml leukemia inhibitory factor plus 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, and 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor), as previously described [ 14 ]. Human Weri-RB-1 retinoblastoma cells (obtained by the American Tissue Culture Collection) were grown in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine. The cytotoxicity of anti-CD133 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was measured as follows: 24-well plates were inoculated with 10,000 cells/well in a volume of 1 ml in complete medium. Twenty-four hours later, unconjugated mAbs directed against epitope 1 (AC133 and W6B3C1) and epitope 2 (AC141) of CD133, all from Miltenyi (Auburn, CA, http://www.miltenyibiotec.com ), were added at different concentrations. Seventy-two hours later, the Ab-containing medium was removed, and the cytotoxic effect of anti-CD133 Abs was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2/phenazine methosulfate microtiter plate assay [ 15 ]. Immunocytochemistry Cells were seeded on chambered slides and grown overnight. Following aspiration of media, cells were washed rapidly with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and stained for 30 minutes with AC133-phycoerythrin (PE) and AC141-PE, directed to different epitopes of the CD133 protein. Incubation was carried out on ice, to prevent antigen capping. Chambers were then removed and slides were coverslipped using Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, http://www.vectorlabs.com ) and stored at 4°C until viewing in a Zeiss Axiovert 200M fluorescence inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY, http://www.zeiss.com ). In Vivo Tumor Metastasis FEMX-I/SUPERctr and FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells were injected into the lateral tail vein of 6- to 8-week-old female athymic nude mice (106/100 µl per mouse). At the onset of hind limb paresis, or at day 60 from the injection, mice were killed, and the organs (lungs, brain, spinal cord, liver, pancreas, ovary, spleen, kidney, and adrenal glands) were collected for histological analysis, fixed, and stained according to standard techniques. Since FEMX-I cells have a hyperdiploid DNA content, to analyze CD133 expression by flow cytometry in metastatic cells ex vivo without interference from normal contaminating cells, we employed the supravital DNA stain Hoechst 33342 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, http://www.emdbiosciences.com ), as previously described. A very good correlation was observed between green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ and hyperdiploid cells, suggesting that retroviral expression was maintained in vivo. Mice were monitored daily by an independent “blind” observer wherever possible. Neurological disease was scored clinically as follows: 0 = no clinical disease, 1 = flaccid paralysis of tail, 2 = hindlimb paresis or partial paralysis, 3 = bilateral hindlimb paralysis, 4 = hindlimb paralysis and forelimb paresis/paralysis, and 5 = moribund or dead. On occasions when difficulty was experienced in differentiating between grade 1 and grade 2 disease, impairment of the righting reflex was taken as a definitive indicator of grade 2 disease (hindlimb paresis). Migration Assays In vitro migration assays were performed using 8 µm-pore Multiwell HTS systems and BioCoat invasion chambers with Matrigel-coated 8 µm-pore poly(ethylene terephthalate) membrane inserts (both from BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, http://www.bdbiosciences.com ), according to the manufacturer’s directions (see supplemental online data). The Matrigel layers of the invasion chambers were rehydrated with serum-free bicarbonate-containing medium, as suggested by the manufacturer. The lower chambers were filled with RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS. Following 24 hours of incubation, the cells on the upper side of the membrane were gently removed with wet cotton swabs. The invasive cells on the lower surface of the membrane were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 30% ethanol for 1 hour before washing. The number of cells in 8–12 randomly selected microscopic fields (10×) was counted under an Olympus CKX31 microscope (Olympus America Corp., Center Valley, PA, http://www.olympus-global.com ). Flow Cytometric Analysis Cell surface CD133 expression was quantitated using the Quantum Simply Cellular System (Bangs Laboratories Inc., Fishers, IN, http://www.bangslabs.com ). Five × 105 cells/sample were incubated with saturating concentrations (10 µg/ml) of Abs for 30 minutes at 4°C. Standard curves of beads with fixed Ab-binding capacity and samples were analyzed on a FACSVantage flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The Ab-binding capacity for each cell population was calculated using QuickCal v.2.3. software (Bangs Laboratories Inc.), employing median histogram values and linear regression analyses. Western Blotting W6B3C1 anti-CD133 and 1F5 anti-DKK1 (Millipore, Billerica, MA, http://www.millipore.com ), were employed for Western blotting according to the manufacturers’ recommended conditions. Microarray Analysis Total RNA was isolated from proliferating FEMX-I/SUPERctr and FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells using Trizol phenol-based extraction. The quality of the RNA was assessed by gel electrophoresis and A260/ A280 ratio. Microarray analyses were performed by Ocean Ridge Biosciences (Palm Beach Gardens, FL, http://www.oceanridgebio.com ) using human exonic evidence-based oligonucleotide (HEEBO) microarrays ( http://alizadehlab.stanford.edu/ ) containing approximately 50,000 70-mer probes complementary to constitutive exons of most human genes, as well as alternatively spliced exons, Expressed Sequence Tags (EST), and control sequences. Biotinylated uridine triphosphate cRNA probes were prepared, fragmented, and hybridized to the microarrays for 16–18 hours with constant rotation. The microarray slides were washed under stringent conditions, stained with streptavidin-Alexa-647 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, http://www.invitrogen.com ), and scanned using an Axon GenePix 4,000B scanner (Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices Corp., Union City, CA, http://www.moleculardevices.com ). For data analyses, the local background was subtracted and the spot intensities were log2-transformed. The spot intensities were then normalized by subtracting the 70th percentile of spot intensity of the probes against human constitutive exons and adding back a scaling factor (grand mean of 70th percentiles). After removing data for low-quality spots, control sequences, and nonhuman probes, 41,964 human probe intensities remained. The human probe intensities were filtered to identify all probes with intensity above a normalized threshold (log2 (3* standard deviation [SD] of raw local background) + mean of log2-transformed negative controls), to arrive at 22,171 probes above threshold in both samples from at least one group. For statistical analyses, samples were binned in two groups (negative shRNA control and CD133-shRNA). The log2-transformed and normalized spot intensities for the 22,171 detectable probes were examined for differences between the treatment groups by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using National Institute of Ageing Array Analysis software. This ANOVA was conducted using the Bayesian error model and 20 degrees of freedom. Gene Ontology Analysis Gene ontology analysis was performed using GenMAPP software (Gladstone Institute, San Francisco, http://www.gladstone.ucsf.edu ) for 20,866 detectable probes with current Entrez Gene IDs. Specifically, the MAPPfinder module of GenMAPP was first used to map all detectable probes, based on their gene targets, to GO and Local MAPP categories. Then MAPPfinder compared the relative representation in each functional group of genes associated with probes meeting one of five differential expression criteria with the relative representation of genes associated with the full set of 20,866 detectable probes. Significance was determined by permutation of Z scores with correction for multiple comparisons as described in the GenMAPP software manual. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction Confirmation of Microarray Data An equal amount of RNA (1 µg) was taken for all samples, and reverse transcription was done using RT2 First Strand kit from SABiosciences (Frederick, MD, http://www.sabiosciences.com ). This kit uses MMLV Reverse transcriptase and a combination of random primers and oligo dT primers. It also has optimized DNA removal buffer that prevents false-positive signals due to amplification of genomic contamination and has a built-in external RNA control that verifies lack of enzyme inhibitors and efficient reverse transcription. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) were performed using RT2 qPCR primer assays (catalogue nos. PPH01752B DKK1, PPH00821A NGFR, PPH01459 NRCAM, PPH02400 PROM1, PPH15109 GAGE2A, PPH01904B TGFB1, PPH00248E AXL, PPH09368 DACT1, PPH00636E CDH2, PPH0095A JUN, PPH05564E LRP1, PPH05667E MAPK4, PPH00150 GAPDH) using RT2 Real-Time SYBR Green PCR master mix. The total volume of the PCR reaction was 25 µl. The thermocycler parameters were 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute. Each sample and each gene were run in triplicate. Relative changes in gene expression were calculated using the ?Ct (threshold cycle) method. Any fold change up or down above two was considered to be significant.

RESULTS CD133 Downregulation in Human FEMX-I Melanoma Cells We transduced FEMX-I cells with the GALV-pseudotyped retroviral vectors SUPER773, SUPER1618, and SUPERctr as control. Transduced cells were sorted based on GFP fluorescence. We employed the Quantum Simply Cellular System and PE-labeled AC133 mAb to quantitate the number of CD133 molecules per cell: parental FEMX-I expressed 423,000 ± 27,500 (mean ± SD) CD133 molecules per cell; FEMX-I/SUPERctr cells had a similar number of molecules on the plasma membrane (417,750 ± 39,700; p = .86), versus 47,850 ± 13,000 ( p < .001) for FEMX-I/SUPER773 and 232,000 ± 16,000 for FEMX-I/SUPER1618 ( p < .001), with an 8.7- and 1.8-fold decrease, respectively. We then established three clones (clones 1–3) by limiting dilution from FEMX-I/SUPER773, expressing 20,900, 36,300, and 278,000 molecules per cell. As in parental FEMX-I, in FEMX-I/SUPERctr cells CD133 was concentrated at the apical membrane of the spindle-shaped cells ( Fig. 1A ), whereas in FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells CD133 reactivity was more weak and diffuse ( Fig. 1B ). Downregulation of CD133 was confirmed by Western blotting of total cell lysates, employing the W6B3C1 mAb ( Fig. 1C ), and by flow cytometry, employing the AC141 Ab targeted at a different epitope ( Fig. 2 ). In both FEMXI/SUPERctr and FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells, a single band of approximately 130 kDa was detected. Heavy protein glycosylation is presumably responsible for the decreased mobility of CD133 with respect to its predicted molecular weight of 95 kDa. Growth Properties of CD133-Underexpressing Cell Line and Clones Whereas the population doubling times of parental FEMX-I and FEMX-I/SUPERctr were approximately 15 hours, FEMX-I/ SUPER733 doubled in 20.5 hours and FEMX-I/SUPER1618 doubled in 17 hours ( Fig. 1D ; n = 4, p < .05). Although all the clones derived from FEMX-I/SUPER773 by limiting dilution maintained integration of the retroviral vector into their genome, as shown by persistent GFP expression, analysis of each clone revealed different growth rates. The reduction in growth rate was proportional to the extent of CD133 downregulation ( Fig. 1D ). We then assessed whether CD133 expression played a role in the capacity of FEMX-I cells to grow under stem cell-like conditions, as previously described [ 14 ]. We found that 3% of FEMX-I cells formed small spheroids under stem cell-like cultures versus 0.2% of FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells ( Fig. 1E ). In particular, FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells were completely unable to form large spheroids during the 7-day assay ( Fig. 1F ). For FEMX-I/SUPER1618, transduction with a different CD133-shRNA resulted in a decrease in the capacity to form spheroids under stem cell-like conditions. Downregulation of CD133 Impairs Cell Motility A significant decrease in cell motility was shown using a 24-hour HTS transwell assay. Figure 3A shows that FEMX-I/ SUPER773 cells had a 78% decrease in migration potential ( p = .002) and FEMX-I/SUPER773 clones 1–3 had an 88% ( p = .0007), 84% ( p = .0006), and 69% ( p = .004) decrease in migration potential, respectively. In the absence of a chemotactic gradient, only 3% of parental cells invaded through the Matrigel layer of the BioCoat invasion chamber, whereas no invasion was observed with FEMX-I/SUPER773 and its respective clones (not shown). Cytotoxic Effect of Anti-CD133 mAb A dose-dependent cytotoxic effect of the anti-CD133 mAbs AC133, AC141, and W6B3C1 on FEMX-I melanoma cells was observed ( Fig. 3B ). The growth of human MA-11 breast carcinoma cells, which do not express CD133, was not inhibited, whereas a very modest effect was observed in FEMX-I/ SUPER773 cells ( Fig. 3C ). For clones 1 and 2, which have a lower CD133 expression level, no cytotoxicity was observed ( Fig. 3D ). The dose-dependent cytotoxicity of anti-CD133 Abs on FEMX-I was confirmed by a clonogenic assay. At the highest dose tested, 2 µg/ml, the clonogenic capacity of FEMX-I/SUPER773 was also greatly diminished ( Fig. 3D ). A 50% decrease in intensity of the CD133 band was observed by Western blotting 4 hours after treatment of FEMX-I cells with 2 µg/ml anti-CD133 ( Fig. 3E ). To investigate whether exposure of other CD133-expressing cancer cells to anti-CD133 mAbs resulted in cytotoxicity, we treated human Weri-RB-1 retinoblastoma cells with AC133. As for FEMX-I, Weri-RB-1 cells also expressed CD133 on the surface of >95% of the cells ( Fig. 4A ). Weri-RB-1 cells expressed 175,000 ± 19,000 (mean ± SD) CD133 molecules per cell, as measured by the Quantum Simply Cellular System and PE-labeled AC133 mAb. A specific band of approximately 130 kDa was detected in total cell lysates by Western blotting, employing the W6B3C1 mAb ( Fig. 4B ). Treatment of Weri-RB-1 cells for 3 days with AC133 mAb resulted in dose-dependent cytotoxicity, with >90% cell kill observed at the highest dose tested, 2 µg/ml ( Fig. 4C ). Metastasis Formation To evaluate the effect of CD133 downregulation on the metastatic capacity of FEMX-I, Balb/c nu/nu mice were injected i.v. with 106 FEMX-I/SUPERctr or FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells ( supplemental online Table 1 ). Fifty percent of the control mice ( n = 6) developed hind limb paresis on day 26, 33, and 57, due to metastatic growth in the thoracic and lumbar parts of the spinal cord ( Fig. 5A ), associated with inflammation, necrosis, and hemorrhage; all mice were euthanized on day 60. All control mice at necropsy presented multiple lung metastases ( supplemental online Table 1 and Fig. 5B ). Instead, six of the mice injected with FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells ( n = 8) did not develop metastatic disease; one mouse presented microfoci of FEMX-I cells in the lung ( supplemental online Fig. 1 ) and one mouse developed a s.c. tumor nodule. Ex vivo flow cytometric analysis of tumor cells dissociated from the nodule and stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD133 mAb revealed that, on average, each tumor cell expressed 400,000 molecules of CD133 on the cell surface ( Fig. 5C ), suggesting that the nodule was derived from an in vivo selected clone in which CD133 had not been effectively downregulated by shRNA. Apart from the mouse with lung microfoci, metastatic cells were not detected microscopically in the lungs, spinal cord, brain, liver, pancreas, ovary, spleen, kidney, or adrenal glands of mice injected with FEMXI/SUPER773 cells. Gene Expression Array Suggests Genes and Pathways Involved in the Biological Effects Caused by Downregulation of CD133 To evaluate changes in the gene expression profile mediated by shRNA-induced CD133 downregulation, we used the HEEBO array on RNA isolated from two independent cultures of FEMX-I/SUPERctr and FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells. A total of 185 probes showed significant differences with p < .05 and a false discovery rate <0.05 ( Table 1 ). Excluding the nonannotated genes and multiple probes, only 76 and 67 genes were found to be significantly up- and downregulated, respectively. In all cases where multiple probes were available for the 143 genes, the changes in expression were very similar. The upregulated genes included 10 established or putative inhibitors of the canonical Wnt pathway, namely, DKK1 , DACT1 (Dapper), LRP6 , three members of the insulin growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) family, IGFBP-7 , IGFBP-9 , and IGFBP-10 , N-cadherin , axl , EFS , and FerIL3 . Gene ontology categories showing significant over-representation of differentially expressed genes are presented in supplemental online Figure 2 . We then employed RT-PCR to confirm the differential expression of 13 representative genes (10 up- and three downregulated). A good correlation between microarray and RT-PCR data was observed for all 13 genes investigated, which included five inhibitors of the canonical Wnt pathway ( Fig. 6A ). The overexpression of DKK1 , the Wnt inhibitor with the greatest level of overexpression in FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells, was confirmed at the protein level by Western blotting on total cell lysates ( Fig. 6B ).  RESULTS CD133 Downregulation in Human FEMX-I Melanoma Cells We transduced FEMX-I cells with the GALV-pseudotyped retroviral vectors SUPER773, SUPER1618, and SUPERctr as control. Transduced cells were sorted based on GFP fluorescence. We employed the Quantum Simply Cellular System and PE-labeled AC133 mAb to quantitate the number of CD133 molecules per cell: parental FEMX-I expressed 423,000 ± 27,500 (mean ± SD) CD133 molecules per cell; FEMX-I/SUPERctr cells had a similar number of molecules on the plasma membrane (417,750 ± 39,700; p = .86), versus 47,850 ± 13,000 ( p < .001) for FEMX-I/SUPER773 and 232,000 ± 16,000 for FEMX-I/SUPER1618 ( p < .001), with an 8.7- and 1.8-fold decrease, respectively. We then established three clones (clones 1–3) by limiting dilution from FEMX-I/SUPER773, expressing 20,900, 36,300, and 278,000 molecules per cell. As in parental FEMX-I, in FEMX-I/SUPERctr cells CD133 was concentrated at the apical membrane of the spindle-shaped cells ( Fig. 1A ), whereas in FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells CD133 reactivity was more weak and diffuse ( Fig. 1B ). Downregulation of CD133 was confirmed by Western blotting of total cell lysates, employing the W6B3C1 mAb ( Fig. 1C ), and by flow cytometry, employing the AC141 Ab targeted at a different epitope ( Fig. 2 ). In both FEMXI/SUPERctr and FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells, a single band of approximately 130 kDa was detected. Heavy protein glycosylation is presumably responsible for the decreased mobility of CD133 with respect to its predicted molecular weight of 95 kDa. Growth Properties of CD133-Underexpressing Cell Line and Clones Whereas the population doubling times of parental FEMX-I and FEMX-I/SUPERctr were approximately 15 hours, FEMX-I/ SUPER733 doubled in 20.5 hours and FEMX-I/SUPER1618 doubled in 17 hours ( Fig. 1D ; n = 4, p < .05). Although all the clones derived from FEMX-I/SUPER773 by limiting dilution maintained integration of the retroviral vector into their genome, as shown by persistent GFP expression, analysis of each clone revealed different growth rates. The reduction in growth rate was proportional to the extent of CD133 downregulation ( Fig. 1D ). We then assessed whether CD133 expression played a role in the capacity of FEMX-I cells to grow under stem cell-like conditions, as previously described [ 14 ]. We found that 3% of FEMX-I cells formed small spheroids under stem cell-like cultures versus 0.2% of FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells ( Fig. 1E ). In particular, FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells were completely unable to form large spheroids during the 7-day assay ( Fig. 1F ). For FEMX-I/SUPER1618, transduction with a different CD133-shRNA resulted in a decrease in the capacity to form spheroids under stem cell-like conditions. Downregulation of CD133 Impairs Cell Motility A significant decrease in cell motility was shown using a 24-hour HTS transwell assay. Figure 3A shows that FEMX-I/ SUPER773 cells had a 78% decrease in migration potential ( p = .002) and FEMX-I/SUPER773 clones 1–3 had an 88% ( p = .0007), 84% ( p = .0006), and 69% ( p = .004) decrease in migration potential, respectively. In the absence of a chemotactic gradient, only 3% of parental cells invaded through the Matrigel layer of the BioCoat invasion chamber, whereas no invasion was observed with FEMX-I/SUPER773 and its respective clones (not shown). Cytotoxic Effect of Anti-CD133 mAb A dose-dependent cytotoxic effect of the anti-CD133 mAbs AC133, AC141, and W6B3C1 on FEMX-I melanoma cells was observed ( Fig. 3B ). The growth of human MA-11 breast carcinoma cells, which do not express CD133, was not inhibited, whereas a very modest effect was observed in FEMX-I/ SUPER773 cells ( Fig. 3C ). For clones 1 and 2, which have a lower CD133 expression level, no cytotoxicity was observed ( Fig. 3D ). The dose-dependent cytotoxicity of anti-CD133 Abs on FEMX-I was confirmed by a clonogenic assay. At the highest dose tested, 2 µg/ml, the clonogenic capacity of FEMX-I/SUPER773 was also greatly diminished ( Fig. 3D ). A 50% decrease in intensity of the CD133 band was observed by Western blotting 4 hours after treatment of FEMX-I cells with 2 µg/ml anti-CD133 ( Fig. 3E ). To investigate whether exposure of other CD133-expressing cancer cells to anti-CD133 mAbs resulted in cytotoxicity, we treated human Weri-RB-1 retinoblastoma cells with AC133. As for FEMX-I, Weri-RB-1 cells also expressed CD133 on the surface of >95% of the cells ( Fig. 4A ). Weri-RB-1 cells expressed 175,000 ± 19,000 (mean ± SD) CD133 molecules per cell, as measured by the Quantum Simply Cellular System and PE-labeled AC133 mAb. A specific band of approximately 130 kDa was detected in total cell lysates by Western blotting, employing the W6B3C1 mAb ( Fig. 4B ). Treatment of Weri-RB-1 cells for 3 days with AC133 mAb resulted in dose-dependent cytotoxicity, with >90% cell kill observed at the highest dose tested, 2 µg/ml ( Fig. 4C ). Metastasis Formation To evaluate the effect of CD133 downregulation on the metastatic capacity of FEMX-I, Balb/c nu/nu mice were injected i.v. with 106 FEMX-I/SUPERctr or FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells ( supplemental online Table 1 ). Fifty percent of the control mice ( n = 6) developed hind limb paresis on day 26, 33, and 57, due to metastatic growth in the thoracic and lumbar parts of the spinal cord ( Fig. 5A ), associated with inflammation, necrosis, and hemorrhage; all mice were euthanized on day 60. All control mice at necropsy presented multiple lung metastases ( supplemental online Table 1 and Fig. 5B ). Instead, six of the mice injected with FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells ( n = 8) did not develop metastatic disease; one mouse presented microfoci of FEMX-I cells in the lung ( supplemental online Fig. 1 ) and one mouse developed a s.c. tumor nodule. Ex vivo flow cytometric analysis of tumor cells dissociated from the nodule and stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD133 mAb revealed that, on average, each tumor cell expressed 400,000 molecules of CD133 on the cell surface ( Fig. 5C ), suggesting that the nodule was derived from an in vivo selected clone in which CD133 had not been effectively downregulated by shRNA. Apart from the mouse with lung microfoci, metastatic cells were not detected microscopically in the lungs, spinal cord, brain, liver, pancreas, ovary, spleen, kidney, or adrenal glands of mice injected with FEMXI/SUPER773 cells.

The overexpression of DKK1 , the Wnt inhibitor with the greatest level of overexpression in FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells, was confirmed at the protein level by Western blotting on total cell lysates ( Fig. 6B ).  CD133 Downregulation in Human FEMX-I Melanoma Cells We transduced FEMX-I cells with the GALV-pseudotyped retroviral vectors SUPER773, SUPER1618, and SUPERctr as control. Transduced cells were sorted based on GFP fluorescence.

Downregulation of CD133 Impairs Cell Motility A significant decrease in cell motility was shown using a 24-hour HTS transwell assay. Figure 3A shows that FEMX-I/ SUPER773 cells had a 78% decrease in migration potential ( p = .002) and FEMX-I/SUPER773 clones 1–3 had an 88% ( p = .0007), 84% ( p = .0006), and 69% ( p = .004) decrease in migration potential, respectively.

Cytotoxic Effect of Anti-CD133 mAb A dose-dependent cytotoxic effect of the anti-CD133 mAbs AC133, AC141, and W6B3C1 on FEMX-I melanoma cells was observed ( Fig. 3B ). The growth of human MA-11 breast carcinoma cells, which do not express CD133, was not inhibited, whereas a very modest effect was observed in FEMX-I/ SUPER773 cells ( Fig. 3C ). For clones 1 and 2, which have a lower CD133 expression level, no cytotoxicity was observed ( Fig. 3D ). The dose-dependent cytotoxicity of anti-CD133 Abs on FEMX-I was confirmed by a clonogenic assay.

Metastasis Formation To evaluate the effect of CD133 downregulation on the metastatic capacity of FEMX-I, Balb/c nu/nu mice were injected i.v. with 106 FEMX-I/SUPERctr or FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells ( supplemental online Table 1 ). Fifty percent of the control mice ( n = 6) developed hind limb paresis on day 26, 33, and 57, due to metastatic growth in the thoracic and lumbar parts of the spinal cord ( Fig. 5A ), associated with inflammation, necrosis, and hemorrhage; all mice were euthanized on day 60. All control mice at necropsy presented multiple lung metastases ( supplemental online Table 1 and Fig. 5B ). Instead, six of the mice injected with FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells ( n = 8) did not develop metastatic disease; one mouse presented microfoci of FEMX-I cells in the lung ( supplemental online Fig. 1 ) and one mouse developed a s.c. tumor nodule.

Gene Expression Array Suggests Genes and Pathways Involved in the Biological Effects Caused by Downregulation of CD133 To evaluate changes in the gene expression profile mediated by shRNA-induced CD133 downregulation, we used the HEEBO array on RNA isolated from two independent cultures of FEMX-I/SUPERctr and FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells. A total of 185 probes showed significant differences with p < .05 and a false discovery rate <0.05 ( Table 1 ). Excluding the nonannotated genes and multiple probes, only 76 and 67 genes were found to be significantly up- and downregulated, respectively. In all cases where multiple probes were available for the 143 genes, the changes in expression were very similar. The upregulated genes included 10 established or putative inhibitors of the canonical Wnt pathway, namely, DKK1 , DACT1 (Dapper), LRP6 , three members of the insulin growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) family, IGFBP-7 , IGFBP-9 , and IGFBP-10 , N-cadherin , axl , EFS , and FerIL3 . Gene ontology categories showing significant over-representation of differentially expressed genes are presented in supplemental online Figure 2 . We then employed RT-PCR to confirm the differential expression of 13 representative genes (10 up- and three downregulated). A good correlation between microarray and RT-PCR data was observed for all 13 genes investigated, which included five inhibitors of the canonical Wnt pathway ( Fig. 6A ). The overexpression of DKK1 , the Wnt inhibitor with the greatest level of overexpression in FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells, was confirmed at the protein level by Western blotting on total cell lysates ( Fig. 6B ).

DISCUSSION The present studies show that CD133 expression is crucial for several biological properties of human metastatic melanoma cells. Stable downregulation of CD133 by shRNA resulted in a decreased growth rate and migratory capacity. We previously reported [ 14 ] that a fraction of FEMX-I cells able to form spheroids under stem cell-like culture conditions was associated with increased tumorigenicity. Our finding that FEMX-I/ SUPER773 cells are unable to form large spheroids suggests that they have lost some CSC-associated properties. Anti-CD133 Abs directed at the glycosylated epitope 1 (AC133 and W6B3C1), as well as at the nonglycosylated epitope 2 (AC141), caused dose-dependent cytotoxicity to parental FEMX-I cells, as well to the CD133-expressing Weri-RB-1 cells. The high percentage of parental FEMX-I and Weri-RB-1 cells killed by the Ab treatment can be explained by the fact that both cell lines express CD133 on the great majority of cells in culture (>95%). Clearly, not all CD133+ cells are endowed with CSC properties. Our finding of a reduction in growth rate for FEMX-I/ SUPER773 and its relative shRNA clones suggests that CD133 expression confers a selective growth advantage to the cells in culture. The observation that FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells were less sensitive to their cytotoxic activity suggests that the interaction of the Abs with the residual CD133 surface molecules is not sufficient to trigger the Ab-induced cytotoxic events. On the basis of microarray results, it is conceivable that changes in signaling pathway(s), coinciding with shRNA-induced downregulation of CD133, interfere with Ab-induced cytotoxicity. Most remarkably, cells with stable downregulation of CD133 showed decreased metastatic capacity in vivo, suggesting that CD133 plays a role in the tumor cell’s capacity to seed to distant sites. The residual expression of CD133 may account for the remaining metastatic capacity. Interestingly, two different oligos in the microarray failed to detect any CD133/2 transcript in both parental and downregulated cells; thus, CD133/2 did not compensate for the partial loss of CD133 function. Gene expression analysis was performed to assist in the identification of genes and pathways that might be involved in the biological effects associated with CD133 downregulation. An interaction between CD133 and the canonical Wnt pathway is strongly suggested by the finding that 10 of 76 upregulated genes were established or putative inhibitors of the canonical Wnt pathway. A link between CD133 and the Wnt pathway is supported by the recent observation that tandem T-cell factor/ lymphoid enhancer factor binding sites in the CD133 gene are conserved among species, suggesting that they are a target of canonical Wnt signal activation [ 16 ]. Regulation of the differentiation and proliferation status of CD133+ cells by Wnt signaling fits with the role of CD133 as a CSC marker, because dysregulated Wnt signaling underlies the pathogenesis of several cancer types [ 10 ]. Some of the Wnt inhibitors found up-regulated are ?-catenin antagonists, like Dapper, or sequester ?-catenin, like N-cadherin. DKK1, highly overexpressed in FEMX-I/SUPER773, interacts with lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)5/6, resulting in endocytosis to prevent formation of the complex with Wnt and Frizzled (Fz) for the canonical pathway. Zhu et al. [ 17 ] have recently established four members of the IGFBP family as inhibitors of the canonical Wnt pathway. Although IGFBP-7, IGFBP-9, and IGFBP-10 were not investigated in that study, it is conceivable that they have Wnt inhibitory activity as well. Although LRP5/6 interacts with Fz and serves as a Wnt coreceptor, LRP1, a member of the same low-density lipoprotein receptor family overexpressed in FEMX-I/SUPER773, represses canonical Wnt signaling, by sequestering Fz and disrupting receptor-coreceptor complex formation [ 18 ]. In a separate study, Zhang et al. [ 19 ] recently found that reconstitution of LRP1 expression in LRP1-null cells reduced the growth rate and suppressed tumor development. Microarray analysis also revealed that LRP6 and several Wnt and Fz genes were expressed in both parental and CD133-FEMX-I cells (not shown), suggesting that the canonical Wnt pathway is constitutively activated in these cells. Targets of the Wnt pathway or genes associated with it, including FoxD3 and TGF?I , and genes associated with the melanoma stem cell phenotype, such as seven genes of the Gantigen (GAGE) family and NGFR [ 1 ], were also among the differentially regulated. Our results suggest that CD133 influences crucial biological properties of CSCs. It is conceivable that CD133, directly or through its interaction with signaling pathways, such as the Wnt, influences cell polarity, migration, and the interaction of CSCs with surrounding cells and the extracellular matrix, contributing to the metastatic potential. The clinical relevance of targeting CSC-associated genes per se is supported by recent studies targeting CD24 for treatment of colon and pancreatic cancer [ 20 ] and targeting CD133 by Ab–drug conjugates for the treatment of hepatocellular and gastric cancer [ 21 ]. Targeting CD133 in cancer therapy has great clinical potential, since CD133 is overexpressed in many human cancers, and especially in several CSC populations. Due to the potential importance of CD133+ cell populations as donor cells for cell therapy, and of targeting CD133 as an anticancer strategy, a close monitoring of the proliferative activity of these cells will be required in future clinical applications, and a control mechanism, such as hairpin RNAs, may need to be in place when using CD133+ cells. Also, anti-CD133 therapy could potentially target and subsequently deplete a pool of long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells and most primitive pluripotent/multipotent stem cells residing in adult tissues. Whereas in vivo studies on xenografts cannot address this problem, because of the lack of crossreactivity of the anti-human CD133 Abs, toxicity studies in mice employing anti-mouse CD133 Abs should precede any human clinical trial. The observation that FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells, expressing, on average, only 47,850 molecules per cell, are less sensitive to the cytotoxic activity of anti-CD133 than FEMXI/SUPERctr cells suggests that the level of CD133 expression is critical for the cytotoxicity effect. That the level of expression of CD133 may be critical is also suggested by the dose-dependent cytotoxic effect of anti-CD133 mAbs on the Weri-RB-1 retinoblastoma cell line, which expresses, on average, 175,000 molecules per cell. Appropriate dose–effect relationships and differential toxicity studies will be instrumental to minimize the toxicity to normal stem cells before clinical testing of anti-CD133 strategies.

Normal mouse cells were excluded from the analysis based on GFP fluorescence as well as DNA content after vital staining with Hoechst 33342. Since FEMX-I have a hyperdiploid DNA content, to exclude the diploid normal cell population of the host from the analysis, we employed the supravital DNA stain Hoechst 33342 (Calbiochem, LA Jolla, CA, http://www.emdbiosciences.com ). After mechanical dissociation of the excised tumors and passage through a 70-µm filter, cells were stained with 5 µg/ml Hoechst, and with fluorescently conjugated mAbs. Cells were analyzed using a three-laser FACSVantage. Five minutes before the analysis, 5 µg/ml 7-AAD was added to each sample to exclude nonviable cells (7-AAD+).

Figures and Tables Figure 1 Down-regulation of CD133 in FEMX-I cells. (A, B): FEMX-I/SUPERctr (A) and FEMX-I/SUPER773 (B) cells in adherent cultures were placed on ice and incubated for 30 minutes with PE-conjugated anti-CD133. Similar results were observed with the AC141 Ab, directed against a different epitope of the CD133 protein (not shown). (C): Western blot analysis for CD133 expression, loading 20 µg of total lysate from each cell line onto an SDS-PAGE. Membranes were incubated with AC133 antibody. ?-tubulin expression was used to normalize for equal loading. (D): Underexpression of CD133 slows cell growth of FEMX-I melanoma in vitro. Cell proliferation was measured by serial counts of trypan blue-excluding cells, and the number of CD133 molecules per cell was calculated by flow cytometry, employing the Quantum Simply Cellular System, for shRNA control cells (FEMX-I/SUPERctr), FEMX-I/SUPER773, FEMX-I/SUPER1618, and three clones derived from FEMX-I/SUPER773. (E, F): Downregulation of CD133 inhibits the formation of small (<50 cells) and large (>50 cells) spheroids in cells transduced with shRNA targeting two different CD133 sequences (FEMX-I/SUPER773 and FEMX-I/SUPER1618). Cells were grown in serum-free medium supplemented with LIF, EGF, and bFGF for 1 week. Bars, SE.

Figure 2 CD133 expression in FEMX-I cells by flow cytometry. CD133-downregulated FEMX-I cells show similar reactivity with anti-CD133 antibodies directed at glycosylated epitope 1 and nonglycosylated epitope: FEMX-I/SUPERctr (upper panels) and FEMX-I/SUPER773 (lower panels) after incubation with the vital DNA stain Hoechst 33342 and the phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies AC133 and AC141, directed at epitope 1 (left panels) and epitope 2 (right panels), respectively. P4 gates represent the fluorescence-positive cells based on their respective isotype controls. Figure 3 Effects of CD133 under expression and anti-CD133 antibodies on FEMX-I cells. (A): CD133 underexpression impairs cell motility. Five × 104 FEMX-I cells and their CD133 underexpressing derivatives were seeded per well onto the upper chamber of an HTS Multiwell plate (0.8-µm pore size, BD Biosciences, San Diego, http://www.bdbiosciences.com ). At 24 hours, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. Migrated cells were counted after wiping off the cells from the upper chamber using a wet cotton swab. The experiment was performed three times in duplicate; results are presented in percentages compared with the control cell line for each experiment. Bars, SE. * p < .01. (B–D): Cytotoxic effect of anti-CD133 mAbs. Cells were plated in complete medium and exposed 24 hours later to different concentrations of Abs for 72 hours. Cytotoxicity was assessed by an MTS/PMS assay (B, C) and by a clonogenic assay (D) . (B): ?, AC133; ?, W6B3C1; ?, AC141. (C): Comparison of the cytotoxic effect of AC133 on FEMX-I (?), FEMX-I/SUPERctr (?), FEMX-I/SUPER 773 (?), FEMX-I/SUPER773 clone 2 (×), and MA-11 (+). SE bars are presented at each measurement. (D): Cells were seeded in six-well plates at 500 cells per well and exposed to anti-CD133 mAb for 7 days. Cloning efficiency was 75% for FEMX-I/SUPERctr and 28% for FEMX-I/SUPER773. Data are expressed as percentage of cloning efficiency of untreated cells. Bars, SE.

Figure 5 Down-regulation of CD133 reduces the meta static potention of FEMX-I cells. (A, B): Hematoxylin and eosin staining of spinal cord (A) and lung (B) metastases from a nude mouse injected i.v. with FEMX-I cells. (C): Flow cytometric analysis of a metastatic nodule developed in a Balb/c nu/nu nude mouse 60 days after i.v. injection of FEMX-I/SUPER773 cells. Normal mouse cells were excluded from the analysis based on GFP fluorescence as well as DNA content after vital staining with Hoechst 33342. Since FEMX-I have a hyperdiploid DNA content, to exclude the diploid normal cell population of the host from the analysis, we employed the supravital DNA stain Hoechst 33342 (Calbiochem, LA Jolla, CA, http://www.emdbiosciences.com ). After mechanical dissociation of the excised tumors and passage through a 70-µm filter, cells were stained with 5 µg/ml Hoechst, and with fluorescently conjugated mAbs. Cells were analyzed using a three-laser FACSVantage. Five minutes before the analysis, 5 µg/ml 7-AAD was added to each sample to exclude nonviable cells (7-AAD+). P3 and P4 gates include only the GFP+ and CD133-PE+ cells, respectively, based on their respective isotype controls. Over 99% of tumor cells were positive for GFP (lower left panel) and CD133-PE (lower right panel).

(A): Fold change in expression for 13 genes differentially regulated in FEMX-I/SUPERctr and FEMX-I/ SUPER733 cells by microarray and RT-PCR. (B): Increased expression of DKK1 in FEMX-I/SUPER733 (CD133?) by Western blotting. Twenty micrograms of total protein was loaded per lane. ?-tubulin expression was used to normalize for equal loading. Abbreviations: MW, molecular weight; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
