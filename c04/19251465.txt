Effects of Neighborhood Racial Composition on Birthweight We employed multilevel models to estimate the effects of neighborhood racial composition on birthweight, using a national urban sample of 1,871 births to unmarried black mothers from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing birth cohort study. The mothers lived in 1,181 census tracts with substantial variability in racial composition and poverty. Controlling for individual characteristics, census tract poverty, and city characteristics, the proportion black in the mother’s census tract had no linear association with infant birthweight. There was an observed non-linear association, but the pattern was inconsistent with prevailing theories of how neighborhoods affect health. The results were robust to alternative measures, covariates, and sample restrictions and when accounting for the length of time the mother resided in her neighborhood.  Methods Data The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study is an ongoing longitudinal birth cohort study. Here, we briefly describe the research design and sample, which are described elsewhere in detail ( Reichman et al., 2001 ). Between the spring of 1998 and the fall of 2000, parents were interviewed in 75 hospitals in 20 U.S. cities shortly after their children were born. Cities were selected from all 77 cities in the U.S. with over 200,000 people, using a stratified random sample. In 18 of the cities, all hospitals within the city boundaries that had maternity wards were included. In the other two (the largest) cities, hospitals were randomly sampled. Within each hospital, births were randomly sampled from birth logs. Non-marital births were oversampled. While still in the hospital after giving birth, mothers were approached by a professional survey interviewer and screened for eligibility. Mothers were eligible for the study if they and the infant’s father were at least 18 years old (this restriction did not apply in approximately one-third of the hospitals, where they were considered emancipated minors), if they were able to complete the interview in either English or Spanish, if the father of the newborn was living, and if they were not planning to place the child for adoption. If they were eligible, mothers were asked to participate in a national survey about the conditions and capabilities of new parents, their relationships, and their children’s well-being. Fathers, who were eligible for the study if their newborn’s mother completed an interview, were also asked to participate. Informed consent was administered to all respondents. A total of 4,898 mothers (3,712 unmarried; 1,186 married) were interviewed shortly after giving birth. The number of unmarried mothers interviewed in each hospital, which ranged from 8 to 193, was proportional to that hospital’s share of non-marital births in the city. The 3,712 unmarried mothers represent 87% of the sampled unmarried mothers who were eligible for the study. For those births, 75% of the fathers completed interviews. We merged measures of tract level racial composition and poverty from the 2000 U.S. Census to the mothers’ survey records using the mothers’ addresses at the time of the birth. The analyses in this study were based on the sample of non-marital births, which is representative of non-marital births in U.S. cities with at least 200,000 people. A total of 1,973 unmarried non-Hispanic black mothers with singleton births completed interviews. Of those, 46 were excluded from the analysis because of missing neighborhood data and another 56 were excluded because of missing data on one or more other analysis variables. The main analysis sample consisted of the remaining 1,871 births. Those mothers resided in 1,181 different census tracts. The average number of births per tract was 1.6; the range was 1 to 14 births. Measures The main outcome is birthweight, coded as a continuous variable (in grams). The key independent variables are neighborhood racial composition and poverty, characterized as the proportions of residents who were black and of households that were poor (had income below the poverty line), respectively, in the mother’s census tract at the time of the birth. The analyses also included known determinants or correlates of birthweight that may vary across neighborhoods. There is a well known U-shaped association between maternal age and birthweight, with teen mothers and older mothers having worse outcomes than mothers in their 20s ( Martin et al., 2007 ). We therefore included measures for whether the mother was less than 20 years old and whether she was over 35 years old at the time of the birth, with 20–34 years old as the reference category. There is some evidence that the teen birthweight disadvantage may not apply to black mothers, but that pattern is not evident in U.S. vital statistics (Martin et al., 2002). Given recent findings that advanced paternal age is a risk factor for low birth weight among disadvantaged populations ( Reichman & Teitler, 2006 ), we also included an indicator for paternal age greater than 35 years (versus less than that) at the time of the birth. There are also strong socioeconomic gradients in birthweight ( Finch, 2003 ). Although less is known about the extent to which this association holds among blacks, we included indicators for whether the mother had less than a high school education at the time of the birth and whether she was a high school graduate or equivalent, with having at least some college education as the reference category. We also included indicators for whether the infant’s father completed high school or equivalent (versus less than a high school education) and whether the father was employed or in school (versus not employed or in school). To minimize sample loss due to father non-response, we used information about the father reported by the mother when father reports were missing. We also included indicators for missing data on father’s education if data were missing from both the father and mother. 1 We included indicators for whether the mother was born in the U.S. (versus not), the parents’ relationship status at the time of the birth (romantically involved but not cohabiting and not romantically involved, both compared to cohabiting), whether the birth was the mother’s first (versus higher-order) and the mother’s health insurance status at the time of the birth (public insurance and no insurance, both compared to private insurance). Foreign-born mothers have more favorable birth outcomes than U.S.-born mothers, across virtually all racial/ethnic groups ( Landale, Oropesa, & Gorman, 1999 ). Family structure is strongly associated with race ( Ruggles, 1994 ) and varies by neighborhood ( South & Crowder, 1999 ). There is some evidence that access to health insurance is associated with favorable birth outcomes ( Currie & Gruber, 1996 ; Hanratty, 1996 ). We also included an indicator for the whether the child was female (versus male). We controlled for the proportion black and the proportion poor in the city to ensure that estimates of neighborhood composition effects do not reflect city level characteristics. Finally, we conducted supplementary runs that considered duration of residence in a given neighborhood, which is thought to be important when assessing neighborhood effects on health outcomes ( Entwisle, 2007 ). As there is no literature to guide us on specifying an appropriate time frame, we specified two different time frames (at least 3 years and at least 5 years) that seemed reasonable. Analysis We estimate multilevel models (linear models of birthweight in grams and logistic models of low birthweight) using MLWin version 2.01 software to account for the hierarchical data structure (individuals nested within census tracts nested within cities). Calculations revealed ample power (P > .99) to detect a .15 effect size of neighborhood racial composition. 2  Data The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study is an ongoing longitudinal birth cohort study.

Analysis We estimate multilevel models (linear models of birthweight in grams and logistic models of low birthweight) using MLWin version 2.01 software to account for the hierarchical data structure (individuals nested within census tracts nested within cities). Calculations revealed ample power (P > .99) to detect a .15 effect size of neighborhood racial composition. 2  Results Figure 1 shows the unadjusted association between proportion black in the mother’s census tract and her infant’s birthweight in grams. The horizontal line across the figure delineates the low birthweight threshold of 2500 grams. This scatterplot reveals no clear pattern. Only when we compare the least black neighborhoods to the rest of the distribution does there appear to be any association between neighborhood racial composition and birthweight. Specifically, neighborhoods less than 5% black have a very low prevalence of low birthweight. The overall pattern is not consistent with any of the hypothesized mechanisms discussed earlier. We used multivariate (multilevel) regression models to estimate associations adjusting for individual risk factors and neighborhood poverty. Since racial composition of neighborhoods is known to be associated with concentration of poverty, one concern was whether there was enough variation in neighborhoods to disentangle the two effects. Table 1 shows the counts of observations by neighborhood poverty and racial composition for the analysis sample. The association between the two is evident (the higher the proportion black, the higher the proportion poor) but there is also considerable variation by which to isolate neighborhood composition effects (many mothers lived in very poor mostly non-black neighborhoods or in non-poor mostly black neighborhoods). Another concern was whether there was sufficient variation within cities to allow us to disentangle the effects of tract versus city level racial composition. As can be seen in Figure 2 , which illustrates the distribution of the sample in each city by proportion black in the census tract, there is substantial variation in racial composition of tracts in most cities. Table 2 presents the characteristics of the sample of urban black unmarried mothers, by proportion black in census tract. Most mothers were poor (had Medicaid births), had no more than a high school education, and did not live with the father at the time of the birth. The rate of low birthweight was 14.0% (not shown). Mothers in tracts with high proportions black were more likely than mothers in tracts with lower proportions black to be relatively young or old, less likely to be foreign-born, less likely to have been cohabiting at the time of the birth, less educated, and less likely to have had first births. In other words, they were at higher risk of adverse birth outcomes. Table 3 displays multilevel estimates of the effect of proportion black in the mother’s census tract on birthweight (in grams), controlling only for neighborhood poverty (Model 1), controlling for neighborhood poverty and individual level characteristics (Model 2), and controlling for neighborhood poverty, individual level characteristics, and city level racial composition and poverty (Model 3). The proportion of individuals in a tract who are black is negatively and significantly associated with birthweight, controlling for neighborhood poverty (Model 1). However, the effect size is relatively small – a change from 0 to 100% black is associated with a 125 gram decrease in birthweight. Neighborhood poverty is not significantly associated with birthweight when controlling for racial composition, which is consistent with a recent finding by Grady (2006) . The association between racial composition and birthweight is only somewhat diminished —to ?117 grams—when the individual level measures are added (Model 2). The associations between individual level characteristics and birthweight are consistent with prior research findings. Female, first birth, older maternal age, older paternal age, 3 the mother being U.S. born, the parents living apart, low maternal and paternal education, and public or no health insurance all are associated with lower birthweight (Model 2), though some of these associations are not statistically significant in our relatively homogeneous (unmarried, black, urban) sample. The estimated effects of city level racial composition and poverty, shown in the third column, are statistically significant. Proportion black and poor at the city level are independently associated with lower birthweight, but the sign of city level poverty is not in the expected direction. 4 The individual level predictors change little in this model specification, but the effect of proportion black at the neighborhood level is reduced by about one third (to ?76 grams) and is no longer statistically significant, suggesting that city level factors underlie much of the associations between neighborhood racial composition and birthweight. Estimates from supplemental models, all of which controlled for census tract poverty, individual level characteristics, and city level racial composition and poverty (as in Model 3 of Table 3 ), are presented in Table 4 . First we expanded the analysis to include a dichotomous indicator for low birth weight (< 2500 grams) in addition to birthweight in grams. To allow for non-linear associations between racial composition and the outcomes, we estimated models that included the proportion black in categories (.20 to .39, .40 to .59, .60 to .79, and .80 to 1.0, compared to < .20). We also estimated effects of the proportion white in the census tract instead of proportion black. The effects of neighborhood racial composition on low birth weight are consistent with those on birthweight in grams. Measured continuously, neither the estimate of proportion black nor the proportion white in the mother’s census tract is significantly associated with birthweight or low birthweight when controlling for city level racial composition and poverty. The associations between categorical measures of proportion black and birth weight do not follow a monotonic pattern. Relative to living in tracts with less than 20% black, residing in tracts that are 20–39% black is associated with a greater reduction in birthweight (?142 grams and 86% increased odds of low birthweight) than residing in tracts in the third and fourth categories of proportion black (.40 – .59 and .60 – .79). This pattern is inconsistent with all the hypothesized mechanisms discussed earlier. Results from additional specifications and sample restrictions, not shown in tables, further support our finding of no significant effects of neighborhood racial composition on birthweight. We found no evidence that effects were diluted by recent movers, as the results were similar to those in Table 3 when we restricted the analyses to mothers who lived in their neighborhood for at least 3 and, separately, at least 5 years. The estimates were insensitive to whether or not we controlled for neighborhood poverty and to the exclusion of health insurance, employment, and parents’ relationship status or any other covariates. Including Hispanic ethnicity, religiosity, family size, household income, and tract level housing vacancy rates did not affect findings. The estimates were insensitive to the inclusion of timing of prenatal care initiation and prenatal smoking, which represent potential mediating factors and are relevant to the theories laid out earlier. Limiting the sample to cases in which the father was also black did not affect findings. Models that included married black mothers in addition to unmarried black mothers produced estimates very similar to those presented here that limited the sample to unmarried mothers. Controlling for city racial segregation using an index of dissimilarity (a measure of racial segregation) rather than proportion black did not change the estimated effects of neighborhood racial composition. Finally, excluding cities with few births to black mothers or few tracts with black mothers (Austin, Corpus Christi, San Jose, Toledo, San Antonio, and Pittsburgh) or any subset of those cities did not change the estimates.

Discussion Social characteristics of neighborhoods are increasingly thought to be important determinants of health and health disparities. However, empirical evidence for such effects has been mixed, possibly because of the difficulty in accounting for selection into neighborhoods. We systematically investigated the effects of neighborhood racial composition on one marker for poor health at birth, birthweight, using a national urban sample of unmarried non-Hispanic black mothers with considerable variation in neighborhood racial composition and neighborhood poverty. The high-risk sample and the variability of neighborhoods positioned us well to detect neighborhood racial composition effects. Indeed, we found statistically significant negative associations between the proportion black in a census tract and birthweight, even when controlling for neighborhood poverty and potential individual level confounders. However, the estimated effect was reduced after controlling for racial composition and poverty at the city level and is non-linear in ways that are inconsistent with prevailing theories of how neighborhoods might affect health. The results were robust to alternative model specifications that included different measures and covariates, accounted for the length of time the mother resided in her neighborhood, and included married as well as unmarried black mothers. Though not the primary focus of our study, it is noteworthy that city level racial composition is associated with birthweight for infants to unmarried black mothers. This finding is consistent with research by Ellen (2000) , who argues that city level segregation, in particular racial centralization and uneven distribution across neighborhoods, may be more salient than neighborhood attributes for some health outcomes. City level racial composition could be associated with the same factors described earlier as potential mechanisms for neighborhood effects—in particular, the availability of resources affecting health care and health behaviors, advertising, and availability of healthful foods. Indeed, if most residents of cities have access to transportation and if most advertising is through television, radio, and newspapers, then cities might be the more relevant spatial environments. Our finding of no significant effects of neighborhood racial composition in our multicity sample is also consistent with the findings from two of the previous Chicago-based studies ( Morenoff, 2003 and Buka et al., 2003 ), suggesting that the results of those studies were not an artifact of unique characteristics of that city or the model specifications used. The analyses were based on census tracts, which are administratively defined neighborhoods that may not be the most salient geographical units by which to characterize neighborhoods and could potentially produce biased estimates of racial composition effects. That said, given the weakness of the associations found and, more importantly, the inconsistency of the findings with prevailing theories of how neighborhoods could affect health, we think the burden of proof now lies with those arguing the existence of neighborhood racial composition effects on birthweight.
