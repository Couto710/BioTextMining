Changes in Transmission Risk Behaviors Across Stages of HIV Disease among People Living with HIV/AIDS Advances in HIV treatment and opportunistic illness prophylaxis have significantly extended the life expectancy of people living with HIV/AIDS. Increased HIV/AIDS longevity is also marked by changes in HIV transmission risk behaviors. Here we review the literature on HIV transmission risk behaviors as they change in relation to stages of HIV disease among persons who are infected with HIV/AIDS. Studies confirm that the time period immediately preceding testing HIV positive is characterized by high risk behaviors indicating the potential for rapid spread of HIV during acute infection. For many people, reductions in risk behavior are seen immediately following HIV diagnosis. However, these changes in risk taking are not universal and great variability exists in terms of how HIV diagnosis influences risk behaviors. Chronic periods of asymptomatic HIV infection are generally associated with some degree of reverting to high risk behaviors. Also, a CD4 count below 200 cells/mm3 resulting in a formal diagnosis of AIDS, is associated with decreased sexual and drug-related risk behaviors. HIV risk reduction interventions that target men and women living with HIV/AIDS therefore require tailoring to stages of HIV disease. Additional research on risk behaviors of long term HIV positive persons is needed.
