Cytokine related therapies for autoimmune disease In short, manipulation of cytokine pathways shows promise as a mean to tilt the balance of immunity toward tolerance. Effective and regulatory T cells vary in their response to a variety of cytokines. In particular, the ability of certain cytokines, for example, IL-2, to provide vital survival signals to regulatory cells and to trigger death of effector T cells or impede IL-15 driven expansion of memory cells has spurred several trials. The ability of IFN?, IL-4, TNF?, and lymphotoxin to exert selective effects upon crucial lymphocyte subset populations in vivo may also enable translation into potent therapies.  Conclusion In short, manipulation of cytokine pathways shows promise as a mean to tilt the balance of immunity toward tolerance. Effective and regulatory T cells vary in their response to a variety of cytokines. In particular, the ability of certain cytokines, for example, IL-2, to provide vital survival signals to regulatory cells and to trigger death of effector T cells or impede IL-15 driven expansion of memory cells has spurred several trials. The ability of IFN?, IL-4, TNF? and lymphotoxin to exert selective effects upon crucial lymphocyte population in vivo may also enable translation into the clinic. Fascinating is the observation that IL-23/IL-23R axis is key to intestinal inflammation. The likelihood is that translational investigators can explore these differences to fashion potent therapies.
