Effects of Green Tea Extract on Lung Cancer A549 Cells: Proteomic Identification of Proteins Associated with Cell Migration Green tea polyphenols exhibit multiple anti-tumor activities, and the mechanisms of action are not completely understood. Previously, we reported that green tea extract (GTE)-induced actin remolding is associated with increased cell adhesion and decreased motility in A549 lung cancer cells. To identify the cellular targets responsible for green tea-induced actin remodeling, we performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis LC-tandem mass spectrometry of A549 cells before and after GTE exposure. We have identified 14 protein spots that changed in expression (?2 fold) after GTE treatment. These proteins are involved in calcium-binding, cytoskeleton and motility, metabolism, detoxification or gene regulation. In particular we found up-regulation of several genes that modulate actin remodeling and cell migration, including lamin A/C. Our data indicated that GTE-induced lamin A/C up-regulation appears to be at the transcriptional level and the increased expression results in the decrease in the cell motility, as confirmed by siRNA. The result of the study demonstrates that GTE alters the levels of many proteins involved in growth, motility and apoptosis of A549 cells and their identification may explain the multiple anti-tumor activities of GTE.  1 Introduction Green tea ( Camellia sinensis leaves) contains polyphenols that are naturally occurring antioxidants and is a potentially promising chemopreventive agent[ 1 , 2 ]. Laboratory and animal studies have shown a protective effect of green tea on cancer of different sites, including the lung. However, the mechanism of chemopreventive activity of green tea is only partly understood. In our previous studies, we have shown that green tea extract (GTE) induces actin remodeling in transformed urothelial MC-T11 cells, antagonizes cigarette carcinogen 4-aminobiphenyl-induced actin depolymerization in untransformed HUC-PC cells, and inhibits 4-aminobiphenyl-induced motility in transformed MC-T11 cells (using a unique in vitro bladder cancer carcinogenesis model)[ 3 ]. The dynamics of actin remodeling plays an important role in regulating phenotypic changes of premalignant and malignant cells, such as altered morphology, tumor invasion, and altered growth and apoptosis control. Using a proteomic approach, we recently identified a GTE-induced actin-binding protein, annexin-I, in human urothelial MC-T11 cells[ 4 ] and in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells[ 5 ]. Our previous studies demonstrated that GTE-induced annexin-I up-regulation in A549 cells is dose-dependent and occurs at the transcriptional level. The increased expression of annexin I correlated with the stimulation of filamentous-actin (F-actin) polymerization, which in turn results in the increase of cell adhesion and decreased motility in A549 cells. In this study, we used a proteomic approach to identify new molecular targets for motility inhibition in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells in response to GTE treatment. Proteomic techniques have emerged as a powerful tool that permits the qualitative and quantitative measurement of a broad-spectrum of proteins that can be related to specific cellular responses.  2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Materials GTE was obtained from Pharmanex Inc. (Provo, UT, USA). The purity of the catechins in the GTE was 84%[ 3 ]. The Pharmanex GTE consisted of a mixture of many catechin compounds, with (?)-epigallocatechingallate (EGCG) as a major component (43.0% by weight), followed by epicatechin-3-gallate (13.7%), epicatechin (6.0%), gallocatechin gallate (5.6%), epigallocatechin (4.0%), gallocatechin (2.3%), catechin (2.0%), and catechin gallate (1.4%). The GTE contained less than 0.3% caffeine. In this study, the concentration was expressed as the amount of GTE per milliliter of media bathing the cells (?g/mL). Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). TFA was obtained from Pierce (Rockford, IL, USA). Sequencing-grade trypsin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI, USA). 17 cm Protean II Ready Gels (12%), 17 cm IPG strips (3/10NL), 10xTGS (Tris-glycine-SDS buffer), DTT, and Sypro Ruby staining buffer were purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories, (Hercules, CA, USA). 2.2 2-D PAGE 2.2.1 Cell Culture and GTE Stimulation Human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were grown in 90% RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA, USA) medium with 1% Penicillin and Streptomycin mix solution (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 10% FBS. Cultures were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 and 95% air, and the medium changed two times per week. GTE was dissolved in double-distilled H2O to make a stock solution of 10 mg/mL. Stock solution was diluted with cell medium prior to its use. Logarithmically growing A549 cells were harvested and seeded at an initial density of 1 × 106 cells in 5 mL of fresh medium in 60-mm petri dishes. After overnight proliferation, the adherent cells were incubated with GTE at final concentrations of 0, 20 and 40?g/mL for 24 hr. At the end of each treatment, cells were harvested and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes. 2.2.2 Protein extraction and sample preparation for 2-D-PAGE A549 cells (2 × 107) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors and sonicated in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 10 mM NaPO4, pH 7.2, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mM EDTA, protease inhibitor cocktail set III (100 mM AEBSF/80 mM aprotinin/5 mM bestatin/1.5 mM E-64/2 mM Leupeptin/1 mM pepstatin), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail set II (200 mM imidazole/100 mM sodium fluoride/115 mM sodium molybdate/100mM sodium orthovanadate/400 mM sodium tartrate dihydrate) (CalBiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 10 sec. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 10 minutes. The supernatant proteins were then precipitated with TCA (10% w/v final)/20mM DTT for 40 min on ice. The precipitate was collected at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C and washed 3 times with 10% TCA/20 mM DTT. TCA in the precipitate was removed through extraction with diethyl ether. After brief air drying in the hood, the pellet was resuspended by sonication in a buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% w/v CHAPS, 100 mM DTT, 0.2% w/v Bio-Lyte pH 3/10:4/6:5/8 (1:0.5:0.5), 5% v/v glycerol, and protease/phosphatase inhibitors (cocktail sets II and III). After standing for 1 hr at room temperature, the sample was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 15°C, and the supernatants stored at ?80°C until use for 2D-PAGE. Protein concentration in these samples was estimated by using a commercial Non-interfering Protein Assay (Genotech, St. Louis, MO, USA), and BSA as a standard. 2.2.3 2-D PAGE conditions Approximately 100 ?g of whole cell lysate was added to 17 cm length, pH 3–10 NL (IPG) strip, which was rehydrated in 8 M urea, 2% CHAPS, 50mM DTT, 0.2% Bio- Lyte 3/10 ampholyte, and 0.001% bromophenol blue. A Multiphor II electrophoresis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was used for the pre-IEF and IEF steps. where the pre-IEF was performed linearly from 50 V to 250 V for 2 hr, from 250 V to 675 V for 1.5 hr, and from 675 V to 1250 V for 2 hr. Formal IEF was then performed with a linear increase up from 1250 V to 3500 V over 2 hr and then held at 3500 V for 19 hr to a total of 70 kVh. After focusing, the IPG strips were first equilibrated for 10 min at RT in a buffer containing 37.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 20% v/v glycerol, 2% w/v SDS, 6 M urea and 2% w/v DTT, followed by 10 min with the same buffer with 2.5% iodoacetamide replacing DTT. After overlaying the strips onto 8–16% SDS-PAGE, the second dimension was carried out using a Protean Plus Dodeca Cell (Bio-Rad). The resulting gel was stained with Sypro-Ruby and visualized with a FX Pro Plus Imager (Bio-Rad). 2.2.4 Image Analysis and Protein identification Triplicate gels from GTE treated (20 and 40 ?g/ml) and untreated cells (control) were analyzed for spot intensity using PDQuest version 7.2 software (Bio-Rad) and normalized for total protein intensity of all the spots. The criterion for significant changes in protein expression was differences more than or equal to 2-fold calculated from the treated and control groups In order to avoid possible false positive and false negative in the protein discovery phase, we have taken the following steps: (1) all proteins with differential expression of 2-fold were considered for statistical evaluation using paired t-tests; (2) alpha-levels for paired t-tests were set up at <0.05 as significant and 0.05 –<0.15 as marginal significant; and (3) for any proteins fit into the criteria 1 and 2; we choose the ones that are involved in modulation of the cytoskeleton and motility for further validation using western blotting in order to test our original hypothesis that green tea may induce proteins that are involved in the inhibition of cell migration. Gel spots showing significant changes were excised by a spot-excision robot (Proteome Works, Bio-Rad). Gel spots were washed and digested with sequencing-grade trypsin, and the resulting tryptic peptides were extracted using standard protocols. The enzymatic digest samples were dried and redissolved in 0.1% formic acid (FA) solution. Peptide sequencing was accomplished with nanoflow high performance liquid chromatography system (LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with a nanoelectrospray (nano-ESI) interface (Protana, Odense, Denmark) and an Applied Biosystems/Sciex QSTAR® XL (QqTOF) mass spectrometer (Foster City, CA). The samples were first loaded onto a LC Packings PepMap C18 precolumn (150 ?m × 3 mm; particle size 5?m) and washed for two minutes with the loading solvent, 0.1% formic acid. The samples were then injected into a LC Packings PepMap C18 column (75 ?m × 150 mm; particle size 5 ?m) for nano-LC separation at a flow rate of 220 nL/min. For each LC-MS/MS run, typically 6 ?L sample solution was loaded to the precolumn first and washed with the loading solvent of 0.1% FA. The eluents used for the LC were (A) 0.1% formic acid and (B) 95% ACN/5% H2O/0.1% FA. The following gradient was used: 6% B to 24% B in 18 min, 24% B to 36% B in 6 min, 36% B to 80% B in 2 min and stayed at 80% B for 8 min. The column was finally re-equilibrated with 6% B for 16 min before the next run. For online MS and MS/MS analyses, a New Objective (Woburn, MA) PicoTip tip (i.d. 8?m) was used for spraying with the voltage set at 1750 V. Peptide product ion spectra were automatically recorded during the LC-MS runs by the information-dependent analysis (IDA) on the mass spectrometer. Argon was employed as the collision gas. Collision energies for maximum fragmentation were automatically calculated using empirical parameters based on the charge and mass-to-charge ratio of the peptide. 2.2.5 Database searching Protein identification from tandem MS sequencing spectra was accomplished utilizing the Mascot database search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK) as previously reported[ 4 ]. Searches were performed using the Swiss-Prot (version 20040831, homo sapiens) database with a mass tolerance of 0.3 Da and with the variable modification set for carbamidomethyl (C), oxidation (M), phospho (STY), pyro-cmC (N-term camC), pyro-glu (N-term E). Positive protein identification was based on standard Mascot criteria for statistical analysis of the LC-MS/MS data. The peptide assignments in the database search results were manually inspected for validation. 2.3 Immunoblot Analysis Cells that were washed twice in cold PBS were scraped from culture dishesin lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM 2-glycerolphosphate, 1 ?g/mL leupeptine, 1 ?g/mL aprotinin, 1 ?g/mL pepstatin A, 1 mM PMSF and 1 mM NaV3O4). Lysates were incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 12,000× g and 4°C for 10 minutes. Protein concentrations of lysates were determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoblot analyses, the same amount of proteins (30 or 50 ?g) was subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and were electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in TBST containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 30 minutes. Reactions with the primary antibody (lamin A/C (H-110), 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotech Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), or ?-actin (1:500, Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA) in TBST buffer containing 3% dry milk were carried out at 4°C overnight. After extensive washing, membraneswere placed on a shaker with biotinylated secondary IgG for 1 hr. Upon further washing, membranes were reacted with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) immediately prior to autoradiography. The relative levels of Lamin A/C protein were determined by scanning densitometry using Alphalmager 2000 software (Alpha Innotech, Cannock, UK). 2.4 siRNA Transfection for Lamin A/C Three small interfering RNA (siRNA)-coding oligos against human Lamin A/C and mRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz: 5?-CUGGACUUCCAGAAGAACATT; antisense 5?-UGUUCUUCUGGAAGUCCAGTT. The siRNA transfections of the A549 cell were performed using the transfection reagent (Santa Cruz) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 2.5 RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR Total RNA was extracted from GTE-treated or -untreated A549 cells using a TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) as previously described[ 5 ]. The following PCR amplification parameters were used: 5 minutes at 95° C, followed by 40 cycles of 95° C for 15 seconds and 60° C for 1 minute. Data acquisition was set at the chain extension step and the melt curve data collection analysis was performed between 55° C and 95° C, with 0.5° C-increments. All data were analyzed using the iCycler IQ optical system software version 1.0 (Bio-Rad). 2.6 Viability and Proliferation A549 cells were plated in 96-well plates (0.5 × 104 cells/well). GTE at 0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 ?g/mL concentrations were added to cell culture media. Cell proliferation was determined at 24-, 48- and 72-hr points. Viable cells were determined using the Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To evaluate the cytotoxicity of GTE, the same MTT colorimetric assay was performed with cells seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1.0 × 104 cells/well according to the recommendation from the manufacturer and treated with GTE at 0, 10 20, 40, 80 and 160 ?g/mL concentration at 37° C for 24 hr. All treatments were performed in triplicate. 2.7 TUNEL assay Apoptosis was measured by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay using the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science. Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. GTE-treated cells plated on 1 cm diameter cover glass were collected, washed, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After permeabilization with 0.5 % Tween 20, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in the solution containing TUNEL transferase and FITC-conjugated nucleotides. Free 3?-OH DNA ends of the cells were labeled at 37° C for 1 h, and fluorescein labels incorporated into the nucleotide polymers were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Fluoview; Olympus; Tokyo, Japan). 2.8 Cell Migration For migration assays, a uniform cell-free area was created by scratching confluent monolayers with a plastic micropipette tip as previously described.[ 5 ] Briefly, the wound area was inspected at different time intervals (0, 6 and 24 hr) to determine the distance migrated by the cells. The closer the gap, the faster the cell migrated. At each time point four photographs were taken and the widths of the wound space were evaluated by multiple measurements. 2.9 Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics, such as mean and standard deviation, were used to summarize the results. The Student t-test was used for univariate analysis. Statistical significance was defined by a two-tailed p-value of 0.05.  2.1 Materials GTE was obtained from Pharmanex Inc. (Provo, UT, USA). The purity of the catechins in the GTE was 84%[ 3 ]. The Pharmanex GTE consisted of a mixture of many catechin compounds, with (?)-epigallocatechingallate (EGCG) as a major component (43.0% by weight), followed by epicatechin-3-gallate (13.7%), epicatechin (6.0%), gallocatechin gallate (5.6%), epigallocatechin (4.0%), gallocatechin (2.3%), catechin (2.0%), and catechin gallate (1.4%).

The resulting gel was stained with Sypro-Ruby and visualized with a FX Pro Plus Imager (Bio-Rad).  2.2.4 Image Analysis and Protein identification Triplicate gels from GTE treated (20 and 40 ?g/ml) and untreated cells (control) were analyzed for spot intensity using PDQuest version 7.2 software (Bio-Rad) and normalized for total protein intensity of all the spots. The criterion for significant changes in protein expression was differences more than or equal to 2-fold calculated from the treated and control groups In order to avoid possible false positive and false negative in the protein discovery phase, we have taken the following steps: (1) all proteins with differential expression of 2-fold were considered for statistical evaluation using paired t-tests; (2) alpha-levels for paired t-tests were set up at <0.05 as significant and 0.05 –<0.15 as marginal significant; and (3) for any proteins fit into the criteria 1 and 2; we choose the ones that are involved in modulation of the cytoskeleton and motility for further validation using western blotting in order to test our original hypothesis that green tea may induce proteins that are involved in the inhibition of cell migration. Gel spots showing significant changes were excised by a spot-excision robot (Proteome Works, Bio-Rad). Gel spots were washed and digested with sequencing-grade trypsin, and the resulting tryptic peptides were extracted using standard protocols. The enzymatic digest samples were dried and redissolved in 0.1% formic acid (FA) solution. Peptide sequencing was accomplished with nanoflow high performance liquid chromatography system (LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with a nanoelectrospray (nano-ESI) interface (Protana, Odense, Denmark) and an Applied Biosystems/Sciex QSTAR® XL (QqTOF) mass spectrometer (Foster City, CA). The samples were first loaded onto a LC Packings PepMap C18 precolumn (150 ?m × 3 mm; particle size 5?m) and washed for two minutes with the loading solvent, 0.1% formic acid. The samples were then injected into a LC Packings PepMap C18 column (75 ?m × 150 mm; particle size 5 ?m) for nano-LC separation at a flow rate of 220 nL/min. For each LC-MS/MS run, typically 6 ?L sample solution was loaded to the precolumn first and washed with the loading solvent of 0.1% FA. The eluents used for the LC were (A) 0.1% formic acid and (B) 95% ACN/5% H2O/0.1% FA. The following gradient was used: 6% B to 24% B in 18 min, 24% B to 36% B in 6 min, 36% B to 80% B in 2 min and stayed at 80% B for 8 min. The column was finally re-equilibrated with 6% B for 16 min before the next run. For online MS and MS/MS analyses, a New Objective (Woburn, MA) PicoTip tip (i.d. 8?m) was used for spraying with the voltage set at 1750 V. Peptide product ion spectra were automatically recorded during the LC-MS runs by the information-dependent analysis (IDA) on the mass spectrometer. Argon was employed as the collision gas. Collision energies for maximum fragmentation were automatically calculated using empirical parameters based on the charge and mass-to-charge ratio of the peptide.  2.2.5 Database searching Protein identification from tandem MS sequencing spectra was accomplished utilizing the Mascot database search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK) as previously reported[ 4 ]. Searches were performed using the Swiss-Prot (version 20040831, homo sapiens) database with a mass tolerance of 0.3 Da and with the variable modification set for carbamidomethyl (C), oxidation (M), phospho (STY), pyro-cmC (N-term camC), pyro-glu (N-term E). Positive protein identification was based on standard Mascot criteria for statistical analysis of the LC-MS/MS data. The peptide assignments in the database search results were manually inspected for validation.  2.3 Immunoblot Analysis Cells that were washed twice in cold PBS were scraped from culture dishesin lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM 2-glycerolphosphate, 1 ?g/mL leupeptine, 1 ?g/mL aprotinin, 1 ?g/mL pepstatin A, 1 mM PMSF and 1 mM NaV3O4). Lysates were incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 12,000× g and 4°C for 10 minutes. Protein concentrations of lysates were determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoblot analyses, the same amount of proteins (30 or 50 ?g) was subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and were electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in TBST containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 30 minutes. Reactions with the primary antibody (lamin A/C (H-110), 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotech Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), or ?-actin (1:500, Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA) in TBST buffer containing 3% dry milk were carried out at 4°C overnight. After extensive washing, membraneswere placed on a shaker with biotinylated secondary IgG for 1 hr. Upon further washing, membranes were reacted with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) immediately prior to autoradiography. The relative levels of Lamin A/C protein were determined by scanning densitometry using Alphalmager 2000 software (Alpha Innotech, Cannock, UK).  2.4 siRNA Transfection for Lamin A/C Three small interfering RNA (siRNA)-coding oligos against human Lamin A/C and mRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz: 5?-CUGGACUUCCAGAAGAACATT; antisense 5?-UGUUCUUCUGGAAGUCCAGTT. The siRNA transfections of the A549 cell were performed using the transfection reagent (Santa Cruz) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  2.5 RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR Total RNA was extracted from GTE-treated or -untreated A549 cells using a TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) as previously described[ 5 ]. The following PCR amplification parameters were used: 5 minutes at 95° C, followed by 40 cycles of 95° C for 15 seconds and 60° C for 1 minute. Data acquisition was set at the chain extension step and the melt curve data collection analysis was performed between 55° C and 95° C, with 0.5° C-increments. All data were analyzed using the iCycler IQ optical system software version 1.0 (Bio-Rad).  2.6 Viability and Proliferation A549 cells were plated in 96-well plates (0.5 × 104 cells/well). GTE at 0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 ?g/mL concentrations were added to cell culture media. Cell proliferation was determined at 24-, 48- and 72-hr points. Viable cells were determined using the Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To evaluate the cytotoxicity of GTE, the same MTT colorimetric assay was performed with cells seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1.0 × 104 cells/well according to the recommendation from the manufacturer and treated with GTE at 0, 10 20, 40, 80 and 160 ?g/mL concentration at 37° C for 24 hr. All treatments were performed in triplicate.  2.7 TUNEL assay Apoptosis was measured by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay using the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science. Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. GTE-treated cells plated on 1 cm diameter cover glass were collected, washed, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After permeabilization with 0.5 % Tween 20, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in the solution containing TUNEL transferase and FITC-conjugated nucleotides. Free 3?-OH DNA ends of the cells were labeled at 37° C for 1 h, and fluorescein labels incorporated into the nucleotide polymers were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Fluoview; Olympus; Tokyo, Japan).  2.8 Cell Migration For migration assays, a uniform cell-free area was created by scratching confluent monolayers with a plastic micropipette tip as previously described.[ 5 ] Briefly, the wound area was inspected at different time intervals (0, 6 and 24 hr) to determine the distance migrated by the cells. The closer the gap, the faster the cell migrated. At each time point four photographs were taken and the widths of the wound space were evaluated by multiple measurements.  2.9 Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics, such as mean and standard deviation, were used to summarize the results. The Student t-test was used for univariate analysis. Statistical significance was defined by a two-tailed p-value of 0.05.  3. Results 3.1 Altered protein levels by treatment of A549 cells with green tea extract Before proteomic analysis, we first examined the IC50 and time-, as well as dose-effect of GTE on proliferation of A549 lung cancer cells. At 48 hr, GTE inhibited A549 cell proliferation by 19%, 41% and 82% at concentrations of 20, 40 and 80 ?g/mL, respectively. The inhibition of A549 by GTE was dose-dependant ( Figure 1a ) but was about the same when cells were treated with GTE for 24, 48, and 72 hours. We made similar observations when MC-T11 cells (a transformed urothelial cell) were treated with the same doses of GTE for 24 and 48 hrs (unpublished data). Our data is consistent with a recent report that A549 cells exhibit least time-and dose-dependent cytotoxic response when treated with EGCG, a major active constituent in GTE, compared with DU145 (prostate), LNCaP (prostate), HT-29 (colon), SKOV-3 (ovary) and other carcinoma cells [ 6 ]. Our GTE dose range (10–40 ?g/ml), equivalent to 20–80 ?M of total polyphenols, is higher than those observed in vivo . However, these dosages are the typical test concentrations shown in the literatures for in vitro anticancer molecular targets. Recent pharmacokinetic studies conducted in humans indicate that the physiologically relevant serum concentration of EGCG or combined tea polyphenols is in the 0.1–1 ?M range, [ 7 – 10 ] while 7.5 ?M of peak plasma concentration has been observed when large pharmacological doses of GTE (1200 mg Polyphenone E, a GTE with 80–98% total tea polyphenols by weight) are given.[ 11 ] Of particular interest is that a duplicate, equal administration of [3H]EGCG increased the level of polyphenols in blood and various organs (a 4.7 fold increase in lung), [ 12 ] suggesting that a high level of tea polyphenols can be maintained with dietary intervention or a lifestyle. The IC50 was calculated from the 24-hour viability data based on the optical density reading [IC50=(50%?low% Inhibition)/(High% Inhibition?low% Inhibition) × (High Conc. ? low Conc.) + low Conc]. The IC50 of GTE on A549 cells was 112 ?g/mL at 24 hr. The induction of apoptosis in A549 cells by GTE was determined by the TUNEL staining, as shown in Fig 1b . Apoptosis after 40 ?g/mL GTE treatment is observed by nuclear fragmentation. For a comprehensive analysis of effects of green tea extract on the proteome of A549 cells, cells were exposed for 24 hr to the GTE at doses of 20 and 40 ?g/mL and cellular proteins were submitted to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. More than 600 protein spots were resolved on each of the gels from with the total cell lysate. Significant changes in protein expression was defined as changes more than or equal to 2-fold as calculated from the staining intensity of each individual Sypro Ruby-stained spots. Sixty-two protein spots showed changes in expression level after GTE treatment ( Figure 2 ); 39 of these were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis. After statistical analyses of the triplicate datasets, we identified 14 proteins that showed a 2-fold dose-responsive increase or decrease in abundance resulting from GTE-treatment. Among them were calcium-binding proteins such as annexin I ( Table 1 ) and proteins that are involved in modulation of the cytoskeleton and motility, such as fascin and lamins A/C proteins. A variety of proteins involved in metabolism, detoxification or gene regulation also displayed significant changes in expression level ( Table 1 ). 3.2 GTE increased expression of lamins A/C Our previous data have shown that GTE induces annexin-I expression and actin remodeling in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. The increased expression of annexin-I correlates with the stimulation of F-actin polymerization, which in turn results in the increase of cell adhesion in A549 cells. GTE also decreases cell motility. However, inhibition of annexin-I expression by siRNA did not completely abolish the decreased motility induced by GTE, suggesting that other proteins may be involved. In order to determine whether other proteins are involved in regulating cell cytoskeletal and motility, we examined the protein expression of lamin A/C by using western blot analysis. Figure 3a exhibited a clear change in lamin A/C protein expression in response to GTE treatment. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the effect of GTE on stimulating Lamin A/C expression at mRNA level ( Figure 3c ). To determine the role of GTE-induced Lamin A/C expression, siRNA experiments were performed. As expected, GTE alone (40 ?g/ml) enhanced lamin A/C expression ( Figures 3b and 3c ). Cells exposed to lamin A/C specific siRNA complexes in the presence GTE showed slightly increased lamin A/C expression compared to cells in the absence of GTE. As another level of control, cells exposed to negative control complex siRNA(?) and GTE together showed an increase in lamin A/C but the increase is less significant as compared to GTE only treated cells. Thus, western blot and RT-PCR analyses confirmed the effect of GTE on stimulating lamin A/C expression, implying that the GTE-induced lamin A/C up-regulation occurs at the transcriptional level. Expression of lamins A and C was found in all NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) cell lines and tumors[ 13 , 14 ]. In addition, cytoplasmic localization of A-type lamins has been observed frequently in NSCLCs. To examine the staining pattern, we performed an immunofluorescence experiment stained with lamin A/C antibody. Figure 2d shows the immunofluorescence for lamin A/C in GTE-treated (40 ?g/ml) and -untreated (control) A549 cells labeled with Cy-3 (top panel) and Alexa flour 594 (lower panel). Lamin A/C is readily detected in untreated A549 cells (left panel). There is variation in the intensity of nuclear envelope staining with a majority of cells displaying a nuclear rim. Intranuclear staining is also observed. There is a marked increase in the intensity of nuclear envelope as well as cytoplasmic staining in GTE treated cells (right panel). To quantitatively analyze the GTE induced lamin A/C expression, automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) was used to measure lamins A/C expression using a Cy3-conjugated antibody. Mean increase in lamin A/C levels was found to be 2.0-fold (n=4) ( Figure 3d , columns). We have reported previously that migration of A549 cells treated with 40 ?g/ml GTE for 24 hours was significantly inhibited compared to untreated control and the inhibitory effect was confirmed using a chemotaxi cell chamber.[ 5 ] To determine whether lamin A/C is involved in the GTE-induced cell migration, we have used cells transfected with lamin A/C-specific siRNA. Figure 4 shows the effect of GTE on cell motility utilizing wound-scratch assay with lamin A/C being blocked. GTE-induced decrease in cell migration was largely blocked by lamin A/C specific siRNA interference, whereas negative control siRNA had no effect.  3.

Figure 2d shows the immunofluorescence for lamin A/C in GTE-treated (40 ?g/ml) and -untreated (control) A549 cells labeled with Cy-3 (top panel) and Alexa flour 594 (lower panel). Lamin A/C is readily detected in untreated A549 cells (left panel). There is variation in the intensity of nuclear envelope staining with a majority of cells displaying a nuclear rim. Intranuclear staining is also observed. There is a marked increase in the intensity of nuclear envelope as well as cytoplasmic staining in GTE treated cells (right panel). To quantitatively analyze the GTE induced lamin A/C expression, automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) was used to measure lamins A/C expression using a Cy3-conjugated antibody. Mean increase in lamin A/C levels was found to be 2.0-fold (n=4) ( Figure 3d , columns). We have reported previously that migration of A549 cells treated with 40 ?g/ml GTE for 24 hours was significantly inhibited compared to untreated control and the inhibitory effect was confirmed using a chemotaxi cell chamber.[ 5 ] To determine whether lamin A/C is involved in the GTE-induced cell migration, we have used cells transfected with lamin A/C-specific siRNA. Figure 4 shows the effect of GTE on cell motility utilizing wound-scratch assay with lamin A/C being blocked. GTE-induced decrease in cell migration was largely blocked by lamin A/C specific siRNA interference, whereas negative control siRNA had no effect.  3.2 GTE increased expression of lamins A/C Our previous data have shown that GTE induces annexin-I expression and actin remodeling in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. The increased expression of annexin-I correlates with the stimulation of F-actin polymerization, which in turn results in the increase of cell adhesion in A549 cells. GTE also decreases cell motility. However, inhibition of annexin-I expression by siRNA did not completely abolish the decreased motility induced by GTE, suggesting that other proteins may be involved. In order to determine whether other proteins are involved in regulating cell cytoskeletal and motility, we examined the protein expression of lamin A/C by using western blot analysis. Figure 3a exhibited a clear change in lamin A/C protein expression in response to GTE treatment. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the effect of GTE on stimulating Lamin A/C expression at mRNA level ( Figure 3c ). To determine the role of GTE-induced Lamin A/C expression, siRNA experiments were performed. As expected, GTE alone (40 ?g/ml) enhanced lamin A/C expression ( Figures 3b and 3c ). Cells exposed to lamin A/C specific siRNA complexes in the presence GTE showed slightly increased lamin A/C expression compared to cells in the absence of GTE. As another level of control, cells exposed to negative control complex siRNA(?) and GTE together showed an increase in lamin A/C but the increase is less significant as compared to GTE only treated cells. Thus, western blot and RT-PCR analyses confirmed the effect of GTE on stimulating lamin A/C expression, implying that the GTE-induced lamin A/C up-regulation occurs at the transcriptional level. Expression of lamins A and C was found in all NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) cell lines and tumors[ 13 , 14 ]. In addition, cytoplasmic localization of A-type lamins has been observed frequently in NSCLCs. To examine the staining pattern, we performed an immunofluorescence experiment stained with lamin A/C antibody. Figure 2d shows the immunofluorescence for lamin A/C in GTE-treated (40 ?g/ml) and -untreated (control) A549 cells labeled with Cy-3 (top panel) and Alexa flour 594 (lower panel). Lamin A/C is readily detected in untreated A549 cells (left panel). There is variation in the intensity of nuclear envelope staining with a majority of cells displaying a nuclear rim.

Figure 4 shows the effect of GTE on cell motility utilizing wound-scratch assay with lamin A/C being blocked. GTE-induced decrease in cell migration was largely blocked by lamin A/C specific siRNA interference, whereas negative control siRNA had no effect.  4. Discussion Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the Western world, accounting for more deaths than those caused by prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer combined. It is estimated that there were over 160,000 deaths attributed to lung cancer in the United States in 2007. Lung cancer is a chronic disease that involves multiple genetic, cellular, and tissue alterations[ 15 ], and it is difficult to cure because of its ability to metastasize early in the lung and to distant organs. The ability of tumor cells to migrate is one of the critical features essential for tumor metastasis. Therefore, it is important to investigate how green tea modulates this migratory and invasive phenotype in lung cancer cells. Our previous studies demonstrated that GTE-induced annexin I up-regulation in A549 cells, and the increased expression of annexin I correlates with the stimulation of filamentous-actin (F-actin) polymerization, which in turn results in the increase of cell adhesion in A549 cells[ 5 ]. However, whereas annexin I specific RNA interference clearly blocks the GTE induced actin polymerization and adhesion, experimental results on the effect of such interference on cell motility with a wound scratching assay are inconclusive. In this study, we found a significant increase in levels of lamin A/C and its modification products by using a proteomics approach. The results from 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were confirmed by immunofluorescence staining, Western blot and RT-PCR analyses, which reveal that GTE induced lamin A/C expression dose-dependently. Lamins are type V intermediate filament proteins that form the nuclear lamina, a filament network underlying the inner nuclear membrane of eukaryotic cells. The lamina has been described as a ‘tensegrity element’, which resists forces of deformation and protects chromatin from physical damage[ 16 ]. Two types of lamins are identified, i.e., A-type lamins (lamin A, C, A 10 and C2) and B-type lamins (B1 and B2/B3). A-type lamins are encoded by a single gene ( LMNA ) and are developmentally regulated and expressed in differentiated cells. The mutation in LMNA gene is associated with a variety of human diseases, such as Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy, and the Hutchinson-Gilfordprogeria. Lamins A and C can assemble a complex of proteins at the nuclear envelope that have characteristics of cytoskeleton linker proteins and potentially link the actin cytoskeleton to the lamina. Through the interactions and connections, the tensile properties of the lamina would radiate through the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, generating a mechanotransduction signaling capability in the cell that links the extracellular matrix to the inside of the nucleus[ 16 ]. Using lamin A/C-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts and comparing to the WT cell, Lammerding et al indicated in recent studies that lamin A/C deficiency is associated with defective nuclear mechanics, such as significantly increased nuclear deformation with applied membrane strain, and decreased nuclear stiffness[ 17 , 18 ]. As the nucleus accounts for most of the mechanical stiffness of a cell[ 19 , 20 ], a decrease in the nuclear stiffness should be reflected by a decreased mechanical stiffness of the cells. Another study has demonstrated that fibroblasts lacking A-type lamin expression show a significantly decreased mechanical stiffness and a significantly lower bursting force, as compared to wild-type cells[ 21 ]. These studies were consistent with a recent finding that cells lacking A-type lamin are highly deformable[ 22 ]. In this study, nuclei of A549 cells with lamins A/C knockdown deformed about 2-fold more than untreated A549 cells, indicating that the latter are stiffer. Large nuclear deformation observed in vivo facilitate migration through solid tissues, a process that would benefit from low lamin A/C expression[ 22 ]. Cell mechanical properties in relation to the cell motility has been a research topic in recent years[ 23 – 27 ]. In particular, cell stiffness is correlated with cell motility and various devices have been developed to quantitatively measure cell stiffness in living cells[ 21 , 24 , 28 ]. Among them, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been increasingly used for measuring the stiffness of living cells[ 28 – 31 ] We have used AFM to measure A549 cells treated with and without GTE and our data show that GTE treatment enhances cell stiffness significantly (unpublished data). The increased cell stiffness after GTE treatment is indicative of the inhibition of cell motility induced by GTE. These and other data suggest that inhibition of cell motility by green tea is likely attributed to the increase in lamin A/C expression. Further studies will be performed to determine if cell stiffness and hence the motility, will be altered by change in lamin A/C in A549 cells treated with GTE. It has been described that the expression of the A-type lamins is reduced or absent in subsets of cells with a low degree of differentiation and/or cells that are highly proliferating[ 32 , 33 ], including human malignancies[ 16 ], particularly leukemias and lymphomas[ 34 , 35 ]. Expression of lamins A and C was found in all NSCLC cell lines and tumors but was absent or only weakly expressed in SCLC cell lines[ 13 , 14 ]. In addition, cytoplasmic localization of A-type lamins have been observed frequently in NSCLCs. Low levels of unassembled lamins were found in the cytoplasm[ 14 ]. In our study, we found that GTE-induced A-type lamins in A549 cells were expressed in cytoplasm as well as in the entire nucleoplasm. It is unclear by which mechanism this pattern of localization occurs. It may be due to the disturbances in the nuclear localization mechanism of these proteins[ 14 ] and the truncation of Atype lamins, causing cytoplasmic assembly of tubular proteins. In addition to providing nuclear shape and mechanical stability, nuclear lamna is also involved in organizing chromatin, regulating cell cycle, transcription, DNA replication, cell differentiation and apoptosis. Cleavage of lamin A/C is important for the progression of apoptosis, and caspase-6 has been shown to be responsible for lamin A/C degradation. Our data clearly indicated that GTE-inhibited A549 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis that is accompanied by lamin A/C degradation. However, we do not rule out the involvement of other proteins such as annexin-I in the regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway. Other proteins that might contribute to the regulation of multiple cellular processes of GTE including annexin I, annexin II and 14-3-3 protein. Annexin I is involved in many biological functions such as cell differentiation[ 36 ], anti-inflammation[ 37 ], apoptosis[ 38 ], and cell growth[ 39 ], and acts as a stress protein[ 40 ]. Decrease or loss of annexin I expression in a number of cancer types including breast[ 41 ], prostate[ 42 , 43 ], lymphoma[ 44 ], esophageal[ 42 , 45 ] and bladder[ 4 ] cancers has been reported recently, indicating annexin I may serve as a useful marker of cancer development and progression. Annexin I was also reported to be degraded in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with cystic fibrosis, and is therefore considered to be related to lung inflammation[ 46 ]. Annexin II has been described in several cellular localizations with various functional implications including apoptosis, signal transduction, and cellular motility. Reduced annexin II protein expression in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer [ 47 ] and overexpression reduces metastatic and tumorigenic potential of osteosarcoma cells [ 48 ] were reported recently. The 14-3-3 proteins comprise a family of highly conserved acidic protein with subunit molecular mass 28–33kD and are widely found in different eukaryotic cells. In mammals, seven isoforms named ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? and ? have been identified. 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to contribute to the regulation of such crucial cellular processes as metabolism, signal transduction, cell cycle control, cell growth and differentiation, apotosis, protein trafficking, transcription, stress responses and malignant transformation.[ 49 ] How specificity among 14-3-3 isoforms is not clear but evidence for isoform specific functions are emerging. In lung cancer biopsies, four isoforms, 14-3-3beta, gamma, sigma, and theta;, in addition to 14-3-3epsilon and zeta, were present in abundance, [ 50 ] however 14-3-3? has tumor suppressive properties.[ 51 ]. Together, using a proteomic approach we have identified several tumor-associated proteins that were changed in their expression upon green tea treatment in A549 cells. In particular, we found up-regulation of several proteins that modulate actin remodeling and cell migration, including lamin A/C, annexin-II, in addition to the previously reported annexin-I. We found that GTE stimulates the expression of lamin A/C in a dose-dependant fashion and that the proteins were present both in nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. GTE-induced lamin A/C, and annexin-I may work together to modulate cell motility.  4.

All data represent one of two independent experiments. (E) Automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) was used to measures lamins A/Cexpression using a Cy3-conjugated antibody. Figure 4 Effects of GTE on the migration of A549 cells Confluent monolayers of cells were maintained in a serum free media, and a lane was scraped through the monolayers of the cells with a plastic micropipette tip. The cells were allowed to migrate across the lane at 37 °C for 24 hours. Cells treated without or with GTE, siRNA, siRNA(?) as negative control or combination under various conditions as specified. The distance (cm) that cells migrated into the area of the wound at different points was photographed using a computer imaging system. GTE inhibited cell migration and the inhibitory effect was significantly diminished in siRNA treated cells (A). Data represents one of the two independent experiments. Bar graph (B) represents the mean + SD of cells analyzed (** P < 0.01).
